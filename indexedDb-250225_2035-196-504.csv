Question,Answer
What is a way to deter threats before they are made?,"By taking preemptive actions, such as avoiding contact or demonstrating resilience, a party can signal that the threat would be futile, discouraging the adversary from issuing it."
Why is it important to show disbelief or obstinacy before a threat is made?,"Once a threat is formally communicated, the committing party has already invested credibility in its execution. Resistance at this stage risks triggering the threatened action, whereas early defiance undermines the adversary’s incentive to commit in the first place."
Why are commitments in threats and bargaining often unclear?,"Uncertainty about the adversary’s priorities creates a 'fog of bargaining,' where both sides may misjudge the stakes, leading to unintended escalation."
How do commitments acquire firmness in bargaining?,"Commitments may strengthen progressively through a sequence of actions, such as imposing sanctions, mobilizing troops, and issuing ultimatums."
What are two ways commitment can be communicated?,"Certain evidence of commitment can be communicated directly, such as through public declarations, while other evidence must be demonstrated by actions, like military drills reported by the media."
Why does simultaneous commitment increase the risk of conflict?,"If both sides escalate in response to each other’s actions, they may create a collision course, as seen when nations mobilize armies without intending war."
What happens when a threat fails to deter its target?,"Both parties may seek to undo the commitment because the deterrence value is lost, though they risk appearing weak if they back down first."
How can isolation tactics nullify threats?,"By removing the means for the threatener to extract concessions, such as preventing communication with relatives in a kidnapping case, the leverage of the threat is nullified."
Why does randomizing official assignments help prevent bribery and threats?,"Randomization introduces unpredictability, making it harder for corrupt actors to establish patterns of coercion or bribery."
Why is there no universal way to assume commitments in bargaining?,"Unlike formal contracts, commitments in bargaining rely on informal signals, which lack standardized enforcement mechanisms and may be interpreted differently by each side."
