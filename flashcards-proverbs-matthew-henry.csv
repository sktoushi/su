We have now before us_ I. A new author_ or penman rather_ or pen (if you will) made use of by the Holy Ghost for making known the mind of God to us_ writing as moved by the finger of God (so the Spirit of God is called)_ and that is Solomon; through his hand came this book of Scripture and the two that follow it_ Ecclesiastes and Canticles_ a sermon and a song. Some think he wrote Canticles when he was very young_ Proverbs in the midst of his days_ and Ecclesiastes when he was old. In the title of his song he only writes himself Solomon_ perhaps because he wrote it before his accession to the throne_ being filled with the Holy Ghost when he was young.,20250223
