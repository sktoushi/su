__A creditable offspring_ which are an honour to thee_ and which thou mayest send abroad_ and appear with_ in the streets_ whereas a spurious brood is thy disgrace_ and that which thou art ashamed to own.__ In this matter_ virtue has all the pleasure and honour in it; justly therefore it is called wisdom.,20250223
__A numerous offspring_ like rivers of water_ which run in abundance_ and they shall be dispersed abroad_ matched into other families_ whereas those that commit whoredom shall not increase___ Hos. iv,20250223
__A peculiar offspring_ which shall be only thy own_ whereas the children of whoredom_ that are fathered upon thee_ are_ probably_ not so_ but_ for aught thou knowest_ are the offspring of strangers_ and yet thou must keep them.__ ,20250223
__Alas! you do but make a fool of me.__,20250223
__As God would do if he should appear to reason with thee. I stand upon the same level with thee_ and am made of the same mould_ and therefore cannot impose that terror upon thee which thou mayest justly dread from the appearance of the divine Majesty.__ If we would rightly convince men_ it must be by reason_ not by terror_ by fair arguing_ not by a heavy hand.,20250223
__As once he let loose his hand to make me poor_ and then to make me sick_ let him loose it once more to put an end to my life. Let him give the fatal stroke; it shall be to me the coup de grace—the stroke of favour___ as_ in France_ they call the last blow which dispatches those that are broken on the wheel. There was a time when destruction from the Almighty was a terror to Job (ch. xxxi. yet now he courts the destruction of the flesh_ but in hopes that the spirit should be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. Observe_ Though Job was extremely desirous of death_ and very angry at its delays_ yet he did not offer to destroy himself_ nor to take away his own life_ only he begged that it would please God to destroy him. Seneca's morals_ which recommend self-murder as the lawful redress of insupportable grievances_ were not then known_ nor will ever be entertained by any that have the least regard to the law of God and nature. How uneasy soever the soul's confinement in the body may be_ it must by no means break prison_ but wait for a fair discharge.,20250223
__As thy friends have done with their arguings. I will not reproach thee as they have done_ nor draw up such a heavy charge against thee_ Nor___ ,20250223
__Be at peace_ at peace with thyself_ not fretful_ uneasy_ and in confusion; let not thy heart be troubled_ but be quiet and calm_ and well composed. Be at peace with thy God; be reconciled to him. Do not carry on this unholy war. Thou complainest that God is thy enemy; be thou his friend.__ It is the great concern of every one of us to make our peace with God_ and it is necessary in order to our comfortable acquaintance with him; for how can two walk together except they be agreed? Amos iii,20250223
__Be not long angry;__ for though anger may come into the bosom of a wise man_ and pass through it as a wayfaring man_ it rests only in the bosom of fools; there it resides_ there it remains_ there it has the innermost and uppermost place_ there it is hugged as that which is dear_ and laid in the bosom_ and not easily parted with. He therefore that would approve himself so wise as not to give place to the devil_ must not let the sun go down upon his wrath_ Eph. iv. 26_ 27.,20250223
__Be not soon angry_ not quick in apprehending an affront and resenting it_ nor forward to express your resentments of it.__ ,20250223
__Be safe; he shall dwell under the special protection of Heaven_ so that nothing shall do him any real hurt.__ ,20250223
__Be thou my high priest; let my name be written on thy breast-plate_ nearer thy heart_ as the names of all the tribes were engraven like the engravings of a signet in twelve precious stones on the breast-plate of Aaron_ and also on two precious stones on the two shoulders or arms of the ephod___ Exod. xxviii. 11_ 12_ 21. ,20250223
__Be you afraid of the sword_ the flaming sword of God's justice_ which turns every way; fear_ lest you make yourselves obnoxious to it.__ Good men need to be frightened from sin by the terrors of the Almighty_ particularly from the sin of rashly judging their brethren_ Matt. vii. 1; Jam. iii. 1. Those that are peevish and passionate with their brethren_ censorious of them and malicious towards them_ should know_ not only that their wrath_ whatever it pretends_ works not the righteousness of God_ but that_ ,20250223
__Before sickness and death come. Do it while thou livest_ for it will be too late to do it when death has removed thee from this state of trial and probation to that of recompence and retribution.__ The days of sickness and death are the days of evil_ terrible to nature_ evil days indeed to those that have forgotten their Creator. These evil days will come sooner or later; as yet they come not_ for God is long-suffering to us-ward_ and gives us space to repent; the continuing of life is but the deferring of death_ and_ while life is continued and death deferred_ it concerns us to prepare_ and get the property of death altered_ that we may die comfortably. ,20250223
__Behold_ we knew it not; we were not aware of the imminency of the danger the person was in; we could not be sure that he was innocent_ nor did we know how to prove his innocence_ nor which way to do any thing in favour of him_ else we would have helped him.__ Now_ ,20250223
__But do not do so___ says Elihu; __for thou knowest not what the night of death is.__ Those that passionately wish for death_ in hopes to make that their shelter from God's wrath_ may perhaps be mistaken. There are those whom wrath pursues into that night.,20250223
__But there is none that can deliver out of thy hand_ and therefore there is no remedy; I must be content to lie there_ waiting thy time_ and throwing myself on thy mercy_ in submission to thy sovereign will.__ Here see_ ,20250223
__But these did not (says Eliphaz); they found to their cost what it was to set God at defiance. Those who were resolved to lay the reins on the neck of their appetites and passions began with this; they said unto God_ Depart; they abandoned all religion_ hated the thoughts of it_ and desired to live without God in the world; they shunned his word_ and silenced conscience_ his deputy. And what can the Almighty do for them?__ Some make this to denote the justness of their punishment. They said to God_ Depart from us; and then what could the Almighty do with them but cut them off? Those who will not submit to God's golden sceptre must expect to be broken to pieces with his iron rod. Others make it to denote the injustice of their sin: But what hath the Almighty done against them? What iniquity have they found in him_ or wherein has he wearied them? Mic. vi. 3; Jer. ii,20250223
__But_ Lord___ says he_ __let me know them from thee; for thy judgment is according to truth_ theirs is not.__ This may be taken either,20250223
__Did you ever know such a man as Job_ or ever hear a man talk at such an extravagant rate?__ He represents him_,20250223
__Do not only turn from sin_ but turn to God and thy duty. Do not only turn towards the Almighty in some good inclinations and good beginnings_ but return to him; return home to him_ quite to him_ so as to reach to the Almighty_ by a universal reformation_ an effectual thorough change of thy heart and life_ and a firm resolution to cleave to him;__ so Mr. Poole,20250223
__Do not overlook and disregard it_ as if it were only a chance_ and the production of second causes_ but take great notice of it as the voice of God and a messenger from heaven.__ More is implied than is expressed: __Reverence the chastening of the Lord; have a humble awful regard to this correcting hand_ and tremble when the lion roars_ Amos iii,20250223
__Do not reprove them.__ ,20250223
__Do not think ill of it; do not put it from thee (as that which is either hurtful or at least not useful_ which there is not occasion for nor advantage by) only because for the present it is not joyous_ but grievous.__ We must never scorn to stoop to God_ nor think it a thing below us to come under his discipline_ but reckon_ on the contrary_ that God really magnifies man when he thus visits and tries him_ ch. vii. 17_ 18,20250223
__Draw me_ else I move not; overpower the world and the flesh that would draw me from thee.__ We are not driven to Christ_ but drawn in such a way as is agreeable to rational creatures.,20250223
__Every thing is indeed as it is with God; that day is honourable on which he puts honour_ and which he distinguishes and crowns with his favour and blessing_ as he did the seventh day of the week; but let my birthday never be so honoured; let it be nigro carbone notandus—marked as with a black coal for an evil day by him that determines the times before appointed. The father and fountain of light appointed the greater light to rule the day and the less lights to rule the night; but let that want the benefit of both.__ ,20250223
__Evidence thy cheerfulness (v. 8): Let thy garments be always white. Observe a proportion in thy expenses; reduce not thy food in order to gratify thy pride_ nor thy clothing in order to gratify thy voluptuousness. Be neat_ wear clean linen_ and be not slovenly.__ Or_ __Let thy garments be white in token of joy and cheerfulness___ which were expressed by white raiment (Rev. iii. 4); __and as a further token of joy_ let thy head lack no ointment that is fit for it.__ Our Saviour admitted this piece of pleasure at a feast (Matt. xxvi. and David observes it among the gifts of God's bounty to him. Ps. xxiii. 5_ Thou anointest my head with oil. Not that we must place our happiness in any of the delights of sense_ or set our hearts upon them_ but what God has given us we must make as comfortable a use of as we can afford_ under the limitations of sobriety and wisdom_ and not forgetting the poor. ,20250223
__Foresee the certain ruin of those that go on still in their trespasses.__ Those that live in this sin promise themselves impunity_ but they deceive themselves; their sin will find them out_ v. 22_,20250223
__Give much if thou hast much to give_ not a pittance_ but a portion_ not a bit or two_ but a mess_ a meal; give a large dole_ not a paltry one; give good measure (Luke vi. 38); be generous in giving_ as those were when_ on festival days_ they sent portions to those for whom nothing was prepared (Neh. viii. worthy portions.__ ,20250223
__Give to many_ to seven_ and also to eight; if thou meet with seven objects of charity_ give to them all_ and then_ if thou meet with an eighth_ give to that_ and if with eight more_ give to them all too. Excuse not thyself with the good thou hast done from the good thou hast further to do_ but hold on_ and mend. In hard times_ when the number of the poor increases_ let thy charity be proportionably enlarged.__ God is rich in mercy to all_ to us_ though unworthy; he gives liberally_ and upbraids not with former gifts_ and we must be merciful as our heavenly Father is.,20250223
__Go to my servant Job_ to my servant Jesus__ (from whom for a time he hid his face)_ __put your sacrifices into his hand_ make use of him as your Advocate_ for him will I accept_ but_ out of him_ you must expect to be dealt with according to your folly.__ And_ as Job prayed and offered sacrifice for those that had grieved and wounded his spirit_ so Christ prayed and died for his persecutors_ and ever lives making intercession for the transgressors.,20250223
__Hast thou considered my servant Job? Though he is poor and despised_ he is my servant notwithstanding_ and as dear to me as when he was in prosperity. Though he has his faults_ and has appeared to be a man subject to like passions as others_ though he has contended with me_ has gone about to disannul my judgment_ and has darkened counsel by words without knowledge_ yet he sees his error and retracts it_ and therefore he is my servant Job still.__ If we still hold fast the integrity and fidelity of servants to God_ as Job did_ though we may for a time be deprived of the credit and comfort of the relation_ we shall be restored to it at last_ as he was. The devil had undertaken to prove Job a hypocrite_ and his three friends had condemned him as a wicked man; but God will acknowledge those whom he accepts_ and will not suffer them to be run down by the malice of hell or earth. If God says_ Well done_ good and faithful servant_ it is of little consequence who says otherwise. ,20250223
__Hast thou_ a poor weak worm of the earth_ an arm comparable to his who upholds all things?__ The power of creatures_ even of angels themselves_ is derived from God_ limited by him_ and dependent on him; but the power of God is original_ independent_ and unlimited. He can do every thing without us; we can do nothing without him; and therefore we have not an arm like God,20250223
__Having made thy peace with God_ submit to his government_ and resolve to be ruled by him_ that thou mayest keep thyself in his love.__ We receive our being and maintenance from God. From him we hope to receive our bliss_ and from him we must receive law. Lord_ what wilt thou have me to do? Acts ix,20250223
__He goes by me in his operations_ and I see him not_ I perceive him not. His way is in the sea___ Ps. lxxvii,20250223
__He is gone_ he is gone___ that she knew not where to find him_ or doubted she had lost him for ever; no_,20250223
__He putteth my feet in the stocks_ that_ as I cannot contend with him_ so I may not be able to flee from him;__ this he had said_ ch. xiii,20250223
__He shall be easy_ and have no disquieting apprehensions of danger; he shall not only be safe from evil_ but quiet from the fear of it.__ Though the earth be removed_ yet shall not they fear. Would we be safe from evil_ and quiet from the fear of it? Let religion always rule us and the word of God be our counsellor. That is the way to dwell safely in this world_ and to be quiet from the fear of evil in the other world.,20250223
__He shall_ by his providence and grace_ answer those letters_ and give thee what thou askest of him_ either in kind or kindness: He shall hear thee_ and make it to appear he does so by what he does for thee and in thee.__ ,20250223
__He who_ before_ had such a beauteous air_,20250223
__Hear_ I beseech thee_ and I will speak (v. not speak either as plaintiff or defendant (ch. xiii.,20250223
__I am gone_ quite lost and undone for this world; my hope hath he removed like a tree cut down_ or plucked up by the roots_ which will never grow again.__ Hope in this life is a perishing thing_ but the hope of good men_ when it is cut off from this world_ is but removed like a tree_ transplanted from this nursery to the garden of the Lord. We shall have no reason to complain if God thus remove our hopes from the sand to the rock_ from things temporal to things eternal.,20250223
__I am my beloved's_ not my own_ but entirely devoted to him and owned by him.__ If we can truly say that Christ is our best beloved_ we may be confident that we are his and he will save us_ Ps. cxix. 94.,20250223
__I dare not put myself upon that issue_ lest God should charge that upon me which I did not discover in myself.__ Job will therefore wave that plea_ and make supplication to his Judge_ that is_ will cast himself upon God's mercy_ and not think come off by his own merit.,20250223
__I have not learned wisdom myself_ but have been a scribe_ or amanuensis_ to other wise and learned men.__ Note_ We must not bury our talent_ though it be but one_ but_ as we have received the gift_ so minister the same_ if it be but to collect what others have written. But we rather suppose it to be his name_ which_ no doubt_ was well known then_ though not mentioned elsewhere in scripture. Ithiel and Ucal are mentioned_ either,20250223
__I have seen servants upon horses_ men not so much of mean extraction and education (if that were all_ it were the more excusable_ nay_ there is many a wise servant who with good reason has rule over a son that causes shame)_ but of sordid_ servile_ mercenary dispositions. I have seen these riding in pomp and state as princes_ while princes_ men of noble birth and qualities_ fit to rule a kingdom_ have been forced to walk as servants upon the earth_ poor and despised.__ Thus God_ in his providence_ punishes a wicked people; but_ as far as it is the ruler's act and deed_ it is certainly his error_ and a great evil_ a grievance to the subject and very provoking; but it is an error under the sun_ which will certainly be rectified above the sun_ and when it shall shine no more_ for in heaven it is only wisdom and holiness that are set in great dignity. But_ if the prince be guilty of his error_ yet let not the subjects leave their place_ nor rise up against the government_ nor form any project for the alteration of it; nor let the prince carry on the humour too far_ nor set such servants_ such beggars_ on horseback_ as will ride furiously over the ancient land-marks of the constitution_ and threaten the subversion of it.,20250223
__I said_ This is my infirmity; it is my folly to think that wise men and fools are upon a level;__ but really they seem to be so_ in respect of the event_ and therefore it is rather a confirmation of what he had before said_ That a man may be a profound philosopher and politician and yet not be a happy man,20250223
__I will answer also my part. I cannot pretend to give a definitive sentence; no_ the judgment is the Lord's_ and by him it must be determined who is in the right and who is in the wrong; but_ since you have each of you shown your opinion_ I also will show mine_ and let it take its fate with the rest.__ When what is offered_ even by the meanest_ is offered thus modestly_ it is a pity but it should be fairly heard and considered. I see no inconvenience in supposing that Elihu here discovers himself to be the penman of this book_ and that he here writes as an historian_ relating the matter of fact_ that_ after he had bespoken their attention in the foregoing verses_ they were amazed_ they left off whispering among themselves_ did not gainsay the liberty of speech he desired_ but stood still to hear what he would say_ being much surprised at the admirable mixture of boldness and modesty that appeared in his preface.,20250223
__I would not let him go. Not only_ I would never do any thing to provoke him to depart_ but I would by faith and prayer prevail with him to stay_ and by the exercise of grace preserve inward peace.__ Those that know how hard comfort is come by_ and how dearly it is bought_ will be afraid of forfeiting it and playing it away_ and will think nothing too much to do to keep it safe. Non minor est virtus quam quærere parta tueri—As much is implied in securing our acquisitions as in making them. Those that have laid hold on wisdom must retain her_ Prov. iii,20250223
__If I cannot be cleared_ yet let me be eased_ by what I say___ as Elihu_ ch. xxxii. 17_ 20.,20250223
__If I laughed on them_ designing thereby to show myself pleased in them_ or pleasant with them_ it was such a favour that they believed it not for joy___ or because it was so rare a thing to see this grave man smile. Many seek the ruler's favour. Job was a ruler whose favour was courted and valued at a high rate. He to whom a great prince gave a kiss was envied by another to whom he only gave a golden cup. Familiarity often breeds contempt; but if Job at any time saw fit_ for his own diversion_ to make himself free with those about him_ yet it did not in the least diminish the veneration they had for him: The light of his countenance they cast not down. So wisely did he dispense his favours as not to make them cheap_ and so wisely did they receive them as not to make themselves unworthy of them another time.,20250223
__If there be any that suffer as thou sufferest. Canst thou produce an instance of any one that was really a saint that was reduced to such an extremity as thou art now reduced to? God never dealt with any that love his name as he deals with thee_ and therefore surely thou art none of them.__ 2. __If there be any that say as thou sayest. Did ever any good man curse his day as thou dost? Or will any of the saints justify thee in these heats or passions_ or say that these are the spots of God's children? Thou wilt find none of the saints that will be either thy advocates or my antagonists. To which of the saints wilt thou turn? Turn to which thou wilt_ and thou wilt find they are all of my mind. I have the communis sensus fidelium—the unanimous vote of the faithful on my side; they will all subscribe to what I am going to say.__ Observe_ ,20250223
__If thou wilt enter into a comparison with him_ and appear more amiable_ put on thy best attire: Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency. Appear in all the martial pomp_ in all the royal pageantry that thou hast; make the best of every thing that will set thee off: Array thyself with glory and beauty_ such as may awe thy enemies and charm thy friends; but what is it all to the divine majesty and beauty? No more than the light of a glow-worm to that of the sun when he goes forth in his strength.__ God decks himself with such majesty and glory as are the terror of devils and all the powers of darkness and make them tremble; he arrays himself with such glory and beauty as are the wonder of angels and all the saints in light and make them rejoice. David could dwell all his days in God's house_ to behold the beauty of the Lord. But_ in comparison with this_ what is all the majesty and excellency by which princes think to make themselves feared_ and all the glory and beauty by which lovers think to make themselves beloved? If Job think_ in contending with God_ to carry the day by looking great and making a figure_ he is quite mistaken. The sun shall be ashamed_ and the moon confounded_ when God shines forth.,20250223
__In famine he shall redeem thee from death; whatever becomes of others_ thou shalt be kept alive_ Ps. xxxiii,20250223
__In justice to them_ for those have forfeited the favour of further means who scorn the means they have had. Those that are thus filthy_ let them be filthy still; those that are joined to idols_ let them alone; lo_ we turn to the Gentiles.__ ,20250223
__In prudence to yourselves; because_ if you reprove them___ First_ __You lose your labour_ and so get to yourselves shame for the disappointment.__ Secondly_ __You exasperate them; do it ever so wisely and tenderly_ if you do it faithfully_ they will hate you_ they will load you with reproaches_ and say all the ill they can of you_ and so you will get a blot; therefore you had better not meddle with them_ for your reproofs will be likely to do more hurt than good.__,20250223
__It is all little enough to make thy passage through this world easy and comfortable: The days of thy life are the days of thy vanity; there is nothing here but trouble_ and disappointment. Thou wilt have time enough for sorrow and grief when thou canst not help it_ and therefore live joyfully while thou canst_ and perplex not thyself with thoughts and cares about to-morrow; sufficient to the day is the evil thereof. Let a gracious serenity of mind be a powerful antidote against the vanity of the world.__ ,20250223
__It is all thou canst get from this world: That is thy portion in the things of this life. In God_ and another life_ thou shalt have a better portion_ and a better recompence for thy labours in religion; but for thy pains which thou takest about the things under the sun this is all thou canst expect_ and therefore do not deny this to thyself.__,20250223
__It is behemoth_ which I made with thee; I made that beast as well as thee_ and he does not quarrel with me; why then dost thou? Why shouldst thou demand peculiar favours because I made thee (ch. x.,20250223
__It will come irresistibly_ like an armed man_ whom thou canst not oppose nor make thy part good against.__,20250223
__It will come silently and insensibly_ will grow upon thee_ and come step by step_ as one that travels_ but will without fail come at last.__ It will leave thee as naked as if thou wert stripped by a highwayman; so bishop Patrick. ,20250223
__It will perhaps be an injury to thyself. If a servant be thus provoked_ perhaps he will curse thee_ will accuse thee and bring thee into trouble_ or give thee an ill word and blemish thy reputation_ or appeal to God against thee_ and imprecate his wrath upon thee_ who is the patron and protector of oppressed innocency.__,20250223
__Judge of the man as his mind is. Thou thinkest to pay thy respect to him as a friend_ so thou takest him to be_ because he compliments thee_ but as he thinks in his heart so is he_ not as he speaks with his tongue.__ We are that really_ both to God and man_ which we are inwardly; and neither religion nor friendship is worth any thing further than as it is sincere. ,20250223
__Judge of the meat as the digestion is and as it agrees with thee. He bids thee eat freely_ but_ first or last_ he will discover his sordid covetous humour_ and as he thinks in his heart so will he look_ and give thee to understand that thou art not welcome_ and then the morsel thou hast eaten thou shalt vomit up; the very thought of that will make thee even to vomit the meat thou hast eaten_ and eat the words thou has spoken in returning his compliments and giving him thanks for his civilities. Thou shalt lose thy sweet words_ which he has given thee and thou has given him.__,20250223
__Keep the king's commandments_ for he has sworn to rule thee in the fear of God_ and thou hast sworn_ in that fear_ to be faithful to him.__ It is called the oath of God because he is a witness to it and will avenge the violation of it. ,20250223
__Lest I sleep the sleep of death_ and then it will be too late to expect relief; for wilt thou show wonders to the dead?__ Ps. lxxxviii,20250223
__Let him give me ten thousand kisses whose very fruition makes me desire him more_ and_ whereas all other pleasures sour and wither by using_ those of the Spirit become more delightful.__ So bishop Reynolds. She gives several reasons for this desire. ,20250223
__Let him no longer send to me_ but come himself_ no longer speak by angels and prophets_ but let me have the word of his own mouth_ those gracious words (Luke iv. which will be to me as the kisses of the mouth_ sure tokens of reconciliation_ as Esau's kissing Jacob was.__ All gospel duty is summed up in our kissing the Son (Ps. ii. 12); so all gospel-grace is summed up in his kissing us_ as the father of the prodigal kissed him when he returned a penitent. It is a kiss of peace. Kisses are opposed to wounds (Prov. xxvii. so are the kisses of grace to the wounds of the law. Thus all true believers earnestly desire the manifestations of Christ's love to their souls; they desire no more to make them happy than the assurance of his favour_ the lifting up of the light of his countenance upon them (Ps. iv. 6_ and the knowledge of that love of his which surpasses knowledge; this is the one thing they desire_ Ps. xxvii,20250223
__Let it be not only not inserted in the calendar in red letters_ as the day of the king's nativity useth to be__ (and Job was a king_ ch. xxix.,20250223
__Let me be always near and dear to thee_ as the signet on thy right hand_ not to be parted with (Jer. xxii.,20250223
__Let me have a little comfort before I die_ that I may take leave of this world calmly_ and not in such confusion as I am now in.__ Thus earnest should we be for grace_ and thus we should plead_ __Lord_ renew me in the inward man; Lord_ sanctify me before I die_ for otherwise it will never be done.__ See how he speaks here of the state of the dead. ,20250223
__Let me have a place in thy heart_ an interest in thy love.__ This is that which all those desire above any thing that know how much their happiness is bound up in the love of Christ. ,20250223
__Let me never lose the room I have in thy heart; let thy love to me be ensured_ as that deed which is sealed up not to be robbed. Let nothing ever prevail either to separate me from thy love_ or_ by suspending the communications of it_ to deprive me of the comfortable sense of it.__ ,20250223
__Let my own children_ in the first place_ receive and give good heed to those instructions which I set down for the use of others also.__ Note_ Magistrates and ministers_ who are entrusted with the direction of larger societies_ are concerned to take a more than ordinary care for the good instruction of their own families; from this duty their public work will by no means excuse them. This charity must begin at home_ though it must not end there; for he that has not his children in subjection with all gravity_ and does not take pains in their good education_ how shall he do his duty as he ought to the church of God? 1 Tim. iii. 4_ 5. The children of those that are eminent for wisdom and public usefulness ought to improve in knowledge and grace in proportion to the advantages they derive from their relation to such parents. Yet it may be observed_ to save both the credit and the comfort of those parents whose children do not answer the hopes that arose from their education_ that Rehoboam_ the son of Solomon_ was far from being either one of the wisest or one of the best. We have reason to think that thousands have got more good by Solomon's proverbs than his own son did_ to whom they seem to have been dedicated,20250223
__Let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacle. Put iniquity far off_ the further the better_ not only from thy heart and hand_ but from thy house. Thou must not only not be wicked thyself_ but must reprove and restrain sin in those that are under thy charge.__ Note_ Family reformation is needful reformation; we and our house must serve the Lord.,20250223
__Let thy power be engaged for me_ as an evidence of thy love to me; let me be not only a seal upon thy heart_ but a seal upon thy arm; let me be ever borne up in thy arms_ and know it to my comfort.__ Some make these to be the words of Christ to his spouse_ commanding her to be ever mindful of him and of his love to her; however_ if we desire and expect that Christ should set us as a seal on his heart_ surely we cannot do less than set him as a seal on ours.,20250223
__Let thy spirit be easy and pleasant; then let there be joy and a merry heart within___ a good heart (so the word is)_ which distinguishes this from carnal mirth and sensual pleasure_ which are the evil of the heart_ both a symptom and a cause of much evil there. We must enjoy ourselves_ enjoy our friends_ enjoy our God_ and be careful to keep a good conscience_ that nothing may disturb us in these enjoyments. We must serve God with gladness_ in the use of what he gives us_ and be liberal in communicating it to others_ and not suffer ourselves to be oppressed with inordinate care and grief about the world. We must eat our bread as Israelites_ not in our mourning (Deut. xxvi. as Christians_ with gladness and liberality of heart_ Acts ii,20250223
__Live with thy wife_ and delight in her society. Live joyfully with her_ and be most cheerful when thou art with her. Take pleasure in thy family_ thy vine and thy olive plants.__,20250223
__Look back_ and see what mischief this sin has done. The adulteress has been the ruin not of here and there one_ but she has cast down many wounded.__ Thousands have been undone_ now and for ever_ by this sin; and those not only the weak and simple youths_ such as he was of whom he had now spoken_ but many strong men have been slain by her_ v,20250223
__Look forward with an eye of faith_ and see what will be in the end of it___ v,20250223
__Look up_ man_ and consider how soon thou wouldest be starved in a barren ground_ if the clouds over thy head should plead thus_ that they have their waters for themselves; but thou seest_ when they are full of rain_ they empty themselves upon the earth_ to make it fruitful_ till they are wearied and spent with watering it_ Job,20250223
__Lord_ pardon my sins_ and give me the comfort of that pardon_ and then I can easily bear my afflictions___ Matt.,20250223
__Lord_ the first word thou saidst was_ Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? There needed no more; that word convinced me. I own I am the man that has been so foolish. That word reached my conscience_ and set my sin in order before me. It is too plain to be denied_ too bad to be excused. I have hidden counsel without knowledge. I have ignorantly overlooked the counsels and designs of God in afflicting me_ and therefore have quarrelled with God_ and insisted too much upon my own justification: Therefore I uttered that which I understood not___ that is_ __I have passed a judgment upon the dispensations of Providence_ though I was utterly a stranger to the reasons of them.__ Here,20250223
__Make thyself agreeable to thy relations: Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest. Do not engross thy delights_ making much of thyself only_ and not caring what becomes of those about thee_ but let them share with thee and make them easy too. Have a wife; for even in paradise it was not good for man to be alone. Keep to thy wife_ to one_ and do not multiply wives__ (Solomon had found the mischief of that); __keep to her only_ and have nothing to do with any other.__ How can a man live joyfully with one with whom he does not live honestly? __Love thy wife; and the wife whom thou lovest thou wilt be likely to live joyfully with.__ When we do the duty of relations we may expect the comfort of them. See Prov. v,20250223
__Make use of the comforts and enjoyments which God has given thee: Eat thy bread_ drink thy wine_ thine_ not another's_ not the bread of deceit_ nor the wine of violence_ but that which is honestly got_ else thou canst not eat it with any comfort nor expect a blessing upon it—thy bread and thy wine_ such as are agreeable to thy place and station_ not extravagantly above it nor sordidly below it; lay out what God has given thee for the ends for which thou art entrusted with it_ as being but a steward.__ ,20250223
__Many shall be brought home to me_ as living members of the church_ from every point_ from Lebanon in the north_ Amana in the west_ Hermon in the east_ Shenir in the south_ from all parts_ to sit down with Abraham_ Isaac_ and Jacob___ Matt. viii,20250223
__My case is singular_ and none is shot at as I am.__,20250223
__My sufferings are such as I have deserved; for my own vineyard have I not kept. How unrighteous soever my brethren are in persecuting me_ God is righteous in permitting them to do so. I am justly made a slavish keeper of men's vineyards_ because I have been a careless keeper of the vineyards God has entrusted me with.__ Slothful servants of God are justly made to serve their enemies_ that they may know his service_ and the service of the kings of the countries_ 2 Chron. xii. 8; Deut. xxviii. 47_ 48; Ezek. xx. 23_ 24. __Think not the worse of the ways of God for my sufferings_ for I smart for my own folly.__ Note_ When God's people are oppressed and persecuted it becomes them to acknowledge their own sin to be the procuring cause of their troubles_ especially their carelessness in keeping their vineyards_ so that it has been like the field of the slothful.,20250223
__Nay___ says he_ __I would not_ for all the world_ be so foolish as to build upon such a rotten foundation; for what is the hope of the hypocrite?__ See here_ ,20250223
__No___ says Elihu: __he seldom suffers wicked men to become old. He preserves not their life so long as they expected_ nor with that comfort and satisfaction which are indeed our life; and their preservation is but a reservation for the day of wrath___ Rom. ii. 5.,20250223
__No___ says Eliphaz_ __it is given into the hands of the saints_ and runs along with the faith committed unto them; and they are not robbed and plundered by strangers and enemies making inroads upon them_ as thou art by the Sabeans and Chaldeans.__ But because many of God's people have remarkably prospered in this world_ as Abraham_ Isaac_ and Jacob_ it does not therefore follow that those who are crossed and impoverished_ as Job_ are not God's people.,20250223
__Now that it has come upon thee_ now that it is thy turn to be afflicted_ and the bitter cup that goes round is put into thy hand_ now that it touches thee_ thou faintest_ thou art troubled.__ Here_ ,20250223
__Now___ says Elihu_ __look upon me_ for this once_ as in God's stead. I will undertake to plead his cause with thee and to show thee wherein thou hast affronted him and what he has against thee; and what appeals or complaints thou hast to make to God make them to me.__ 8. That he was not an unequal match for him: __I also am formed out of the clay. I also_ as well as the first man (Gen. ii.,20250223
__O that I were in as good a frame of spirit as I was in then!__ That which Job complained most of now was a load upon his spirits_ through God's withdrawing from him; and therefore he wishes he now had his spirit as much enlarged and encouraged in the service of God as he had then and that he had as much freedom and fellowship with him as then thought himself happy in. This was in the days of his youth (v. when he was in the prime of his time for the enjoyment of those things and could relish them with the highest gust. Note_ Those that prosper in the days of their youth know not what black and cloudy days they are yet reserved for. Two things made the months past pleasant to Job:—,20250223
__O that I were in as good a state as I was in then_ that I had as much wealth_ honour_ and pleasure_ as I had then!__ This he wishes_ from a concern he had_ not so much for his ease_ as for his reputation and the glory of his God_ which he thought were eclipsed by his present sufferings. __O that I might be restored to my prosperity_ and then the censures and reproaches of my friends would be effectually silenced_ even upon their own principles_ and for ever rolled away!__ If this be our end in desiring life_ health_ and prosperity_ that God may be glorified_ and the credit of our holy profession rescued_ preserved_ and advanced_ the desire is not only natural_ but spiritual,20250223
__Read the word written_ sit under the word preached_ bless God for both_ and hear him in both speaking to you.__ Let children age_ and what they hearken to then_ it is likely_ they will be so seasoned by as to be governed by all their days. Let Wisdom's children justify Wisdom by hearkening to her and show themselves to be indeed her children. We must hear Wisdom's words_ ,20250223
__Reckon thyself well done to if thou be clothed with home-spun cloth with the fleece of thy own lambs_ and fed with goats' milk; let that serve for thy food which serves for the food of thy household and the maintenance of thy maidens. Be not desirous of dainties_ far-fetched and dear-bought.__,20250223
__Refuse it not now_ lest you should not have another offer.__ ,20250223
__Save his soul___ that is_ __his reason__ (so some)_ __preserve to him the use of that_ for otherwise it will be no fair trial; if_ in his delirium_ he should curse God_ that will be no disproof of his integrity. It would be the language not of his heart_ but of his distemper.__ Job_ in being thus maligned by Satan_ was a type of Christ_ the first prophecy of whom was that Satan should bruise his heel (Gen. iii. and so he was foiled_ as in Job's case. Satan tempted him to let go his integrity_ his adoption (Matt. iv. 6): If thou be the Son of God. He entered into the heart of Judas who betrayed Christ_ and (some think) with his terrors put Christ into his agony in the garden. He had permission to touch his bone and his flesh without exception of his life_ because by dying he was to do that which Job could not do—destroy him that had the power of death_ that is_ the devil.,20250223
__See the eye of God always upon thee and let his fear rule in thy heart___ v,20250223
__Set God before thee_ and then_ if thou seest the oppression of the poor_ thou wilt not marvel at the matter_ nor find fault with divine Providence_ nor think the worse of the institution of magistracy_ when thou seest the ends of it thus perverted_ nor of religion_ when thou seest it will not secure men from suffering wrong.__ Observe here,20250223
__Shall a man pretend to be more just and pure than God? more truly to understand_ and more strictly to observe_ the rules and laws of equity than God? Shall Enosh_ mortal and miserable man_ be so insolent; nay_ shall Geber_ the strongest and most eminent man_ man at his best estate_ pretend to compare with God_ or stand in competition with him?__ Note_ It is most impious and absurd to think either others or ourselves more just and pure than God. Those that quarrel and find fault with the directions of the divine law_ the dispensations of the divine grace_ or the disposals of the divine providence_ make themselves more just and pure than God; and those who thus reprove God_ let them answer it. What! sinful man! (for he would not have been mortal if he had not been sinful) short-sighted man! Shall he pretend to be more just_ more pure_ than God_ who_ being his Maker_ is his Lord and owner? Shall the clay contend with the potter? What justice and purity there is in man_ God is the author of it_ and therefore is himself more just and pure. See Ps. xciv. 9_ 10.,20250223
__Shall we not expect to receive it? If God give us so many good things_ shall we be surprised_ or think it strange_ if he sometimes afflict us_ when he has told us that prosperity and adversity are set the one over against the other?__ 1 Pet. iv,20250223
__Shall we not set ourselves to receive it aright?__ The word signifies to receive as a gift_ and denotes a pious affection and disposition of soul under our afflictions_ neither despising them nor fainting under them_ accounting them gifts (Phil. i. accepting them as punishments of our iniquity (Lev. xxvi. acquiescing in the will of God in them (__Let him do with me as seemeth him good__)_ and accommodating ourselves to them_ as those that know how to want as well as how to abound_ Phil. iv,20250223
__So far from that___ says Job_ __that what we are concerned to know we may learn even from the inferior creatures; for who knows not from all these? v,20250223
__Tell me how often do you see the candle of the wicked put out? Do you not as often see it burnt down to the socket_ until it goes out of itself? v,20250223
__That countenance of thine_ which thou art ashamed of_ is comely_ though now mournful_ much more will it be so when it becomes cheerful.__ Then the voice of prayer is sweet and acceptable to God when the countenance_ the conversation in which we show ourselves before men_ is holy_ and so comely_ and agreeable to our profession. Those that are sanctified have the best comeliness.,20250223
__That thou mayest act wisely—that thou mayest regard discretion.__ Solomon's lectures are not designed to fill our heads with notions_ with matters of nice speculation_ or doubtful disputation_ but to guide us in the government of ourselves_ that we may act prudently_ so as becomes us and so as will be for our true interest. ,20250223
__That thou mayest speak wisely—that thy lips may keep knowledge_ and thou mayest have it ready at thy tongue's end__ (as we say)_ __for the benefit of those with whom thou dost converse.__ The priest's lips are said to keep knowledge (Mal. ii. 7); but those that are ready and mighty in the scriptures may not only in their devotions_ but in their discourses_ be spiritual priests.,20250223
__That thou shouldst concern thyself so much about him_ shouldst set thy heart upon him_ as dear to thee_ and one that thou hast a kindness for?__ (3.),20250223
__That thou shouldst put such honour upon him_ shouldst magnify him_ by taking him into covenant and communion with thyself?__ ,20250223
__That thou shouldst try him_ shouldst feel his pulse and observe his looks_ every moment_ as in care about him and jealous over him?__ That such a worm of the earth as man is should be the darling and favourite of heaven is what we have reason for ever to admire.,20250223
__That thou shouldst visit him with thy compassions every morning_ as we daily visit a particular friend_ or as the physician visits his patients every morning to help them?__ ,20250223
__The providence of God usually crosses and embarrasses such; and snares are_ accordingly_ round about thee_ so that_ which way soever thou steppest or lookest_ thou findest thyself in distress; and others are as hard upon thee as thou hast been upon the poor.__ ,20250223
__The reproofs of instruction are therefore the way of life to thee_ because they are designed to keep thee from the evil woman_ who will be certain death to thee_ from being enticed by the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman_ who pretends to love thee_ but intends to ruin thee.__ Those that will be wrought upon by flattery make themselves a very easy prey to the tempter; and those who would avoid that snare must take well-instructed reproofs as great kindnesses and be thankful to those that will deal faithfully with them_ Prov. xxvii. 5_ 6. ,20250223
__The tabernacles of robbers prosper___ he here enlarges upon. He lays down his general proposition (ver. 1)_ that the punishment of wicked people is not so visible and apparent as his friends supposed_ and then proves it by an induction of particulars.,20250223
__Their consciences may be expected to terrify and accuse them. No sin makes a louder cry there than unmercifulness; and_ accordingly_ sudden fear troubles thee; and_ though thou wilt not own it_ it is guilt of this kind that creates thee all this terror.__ Zophar had insinuated this_ ch. xx. 19_ 20. ,20250223
__Then shalt thou lift up thy face to God with boldness_ and not be afraid_ as thou now art_ to draw near to him. Thy countenance is now fallen_ and thou lookest dejected; but_ when thou hast made thy peace with God_ thou shalt blush no more_ tremble no more_ and hang thy head no more_ as thou dost now_ but shalt cheerfully_ and with a gracious assurance_ show thyself to him_ pray before him_ and expect blessings from him.__,20250223
__Then thou shalt by thy praises reply to the gracious answers which he sent thee: Thou shalt pay thy vows_ and that shall be acceptable to him and fetch in further mercy.__ Note_ When God performs that which in our distress we prayed for we must make conscience of performing that which we then promised_ else we do not deal honestly. If we promised nothing else we promised to be thankful_ and that is enough_ for it includes all_ Ps. cxvi. 14.,20250223
__There is an opportunity to be observed and improved_ a time when the hay appears; but_ if thou let slip that time_ thy flocks and herds will fare the worse for it. As for ourselves_ so for our cattle_ we ought_ with the ant_ to provide meat in summer.__,20250223
__There needs no great labour_ no ploughing or sowing; the food for them is the spontaneous product of the ground; thou hast nothing to do but to turn them into it in the summer_ when the grass shows itself_ and to gather the herbs of the mountains for them against winter. God has done his part; thou art ungrateful to him_ and unjustly refusest to serve his providence_ if thou dost not do thine.__ ,20250223
__There we shall find pleasant odours_ for the mandrakes give a smell;__ the love-flowers or lovely ones (so the word signifies)_ or the love-fruits; it was something that was in all respects very grateful_ so valuable that Rachel and Leah had like to have fallen out above it_ Gen. xxx,20250223
__Therefore_ Lord_ kindly ease me by death_ for that will be a perpetual ease. I shall return no more to the calamities of this life.__ When we are dead we are gone_ to return no more_ ,20250223
__These things hast thou hidden in thy heart. Both are according to the counsel of thy own will_ and therefore undoubtedly consistent_ however they seem.__ When God thus strangely changes his way_ though we cannot account for it_ we are bound to believe there are good reasons for it hidden in his heart_ which will be manifested shortly. It is not with us_ or in our reach_ to assign the cause_ but I know that this is with thee. Known unto God are all his works.,20250223
__They are brought to their wits' end_ so amazed and bewildered that they know not what to do_ and that also is thy case; for thou art in darkness that thou canst not see wherefore God contends with thee nor what is the best course for thee to take_ for abundance of waters cover thee___ that is_ __thou art in a mist_ in the midst of dark waters_ in the thick clouds of the sky.__ Note_ Those that have not shown mercy may justly be denied the comfortable hope that they shall find mercy; and then what can they expect but snares_ and darkness_ and continual fear?,20250223
__They are made known_ publicly known_ that all may read_—plainly known_ that he that runs may read_—made known this day more fully than ever before_ in this day of light and knowledge_—made known in this thy day. But it is only a little while that this light is with thee; perhaps the things that are this day made known to thee_ if thou improve not the day of thy visitation_ may_ before to-morrow_ be hidden from thy eyes. They are written_ for the greater certainty_ and that they may be received and the more safely transmitted pure and entire to posterity. But that which the emphasis is here most laid upon is that they are made known to thee_ even to thee_ and written to thee_ as if it were a letter directed to thee by name. It is suited to thee and to thy case; thou mayest in this glass see thy own face; it is intended for thee_ to be a rule to thee_ and by it thou must be judged.__ We cannot say of these things_ __They are good things_ but they are nothing to us;__ no_ they are of the greatest concern imaginable to us.,20250223
__They are mockers_ who deride my calamities_ and insult over me_ because I am thus brought low. They are so with me_ abusing me to my face_ pretending friendship in their visit_ but intending mischief. I cannot get clear of them; they are continually tearing me_ and they will not be wrought upon_ either by reason or pity_ to let fall the prosecution.__ ,20250223
__Think not_ because in the night people retire to their place_ go up to their beds_ and it is then easy to escape being discovered by them_ that God also ascends to his place_ and cannot see thee. No; he neither slumbers nor sleeps. His eyes are open upon the children of men_ not only in all places_ but at all times. No rocks nor mountains can shelter us from his eye.__ Some understand it of the night of death; that is the night by which men are cut off from their place_ and Job had earnestly breathed for that night_ as the hireling desires the evening_ ch. vii,20250223
__This is holding the truth in unrighteousness_ fighting against religion with its own weapons_ and turning its own artillery upon itself: thou art willing to own that God is in the height of heaven but thence thou inferrest_ How doth God know?__ Bad men expel the fear of God out of their hearts by banishing the eye of God out of the world (Ezek. viii. and care not what they do if they can but persuade themselves that God does not know. Eliphaz suspected that,20250223
__Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee_ and nothing else unless thou take pains with it.__ See what a blessing to the world the husbandman's calling is_ and what a wilderness this earth_ even Canaan itself_ would be without it. The king himself is served of the field_ but he would be ill served if God did not teach the husbandman discretion and diligence to clear the ground_ plant it_ sow it_ and fence it. See what a great difference there is between some and others in the management even of their worldly affairs_ and how little some consult their reputation_ not caring though they proclaim their slothfulness_ in the manifest effects of it_ to all that pass by_ shamed by their neighbour's diligence,20250223
__Thou complainest that thou dost not understand the meaning of his severe dealings with thee_ nor discern the drift and design of them___ ch. xxiii. 8_ 9. And_ 2. __Thou despairest of seeing his gracious returns to thee_ of seeing better days again_ and art ready to give up all for gone;__ as Hezekiah (Isa. xxxviii.,20250223
__Thou dost not speak the language of a righteous man. I do not deny but thou art such a one_ but in this thou dost not make it to appear.__ Many that are just yet_ in some particular instances_ do not speak and act like themselves; and as_ on the one hand_ we must not fail to tell even a good man wherein he mistakes and does amiss_ nor flatter him in his errors and passions_ for in that we ar not kind_ so on the other hand we must not draw men's characters_ nor pass a judgment on them_ from one instance_ or some few misplaced words_ for in that we are not just. In many things we all offend_ and therefore must be candid in our censures. Two things Elihu proposes to Job's consideration_ to convince him that he had said amiss:—,20250223
__Thou hast made me_ and therefore thou hast a perfect knowledge of me (Ps. cxxxix. 1-13)_ and needest not to examine me by scourging_ nor to put me upon the rack for the discovery of what is within me.__ 2. __Thou hast made me_ as the clay_ by an act of sovereignty; and wilt thou by a like act of sovereignty unmake me again? If so_ I must submit.__ 3. __Wilt thou destroy the work of thy own hands?__ It is a plea the saints have often used in prayer_ We are the clay and thou our potter_ Isa. lxiv,20250223
__Thou hast_ in effect_ said_ My righteousness is more than God's___ that is_ __I have done more for God than ever he did for me; so that_ when the accounts are balanced_ he will be brought in debtor to me.__ As if Job thought his services had been paid less than they deserved and his sins punished more than they deserved_ which is a most unjust and wicked thought for any man to harbour and especially to utter. When Job insisted so much upon his own integrity_ and the severity of God's dealings with him_ he did in effect say_ My righteousness is more than God's; whereas_ though we be ever so good and our afflictions ever so great_ we are chargeable with unrighteousness and God is not,20250223
__Thou shalt bear the blame of it.__ Those that are good must thank God_ but those that are wicked may thank themselves; it is not owing to God (he is not the author of sin); Satan can only tempt_ he cannot force; and wicked companions are but his instruments; so that all the fault must lie on the sinner himself. ,20250223
__Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest; it will be to thy own destruction; thy blood will be upon thy own head_ and the consideration of this will aggravate thy condemnation. Son_ remember_ that thou hadst this fair offer made thee_ and thou wouldst not accept it; thou stoodest fair for life_ but didst choose death rather.__,20250223
__Thou shalt by prayer send letters to God: Thou shalt make thy prayer__ (the word is_ Thou shalt multiply thy prayers) __unto him_ and he will not think thy letters troublesome_ though many and long. The oftener we come to the throne of grace the more welcome. Under all thy burdens_ in all thy wants_ cares_ and fears_ thou shalt send to heaven for guidance and strength_ wisdom_ and comfort_ and good success.__ ,20250223
__Thou shalt dig about thee___ that is_ __Thou shalt be as safe as an army in its entrenchments.__ Those that submit to God's government shall be taken under his protection_ and then they are safe both day and night.,20250223
__Thou shalt not only be protected from the killing sword of war_ but shalt be hidden from the scourge of the tongue_ which_ like a scourge_ is vexing and painful_ though not mortal.__ The best men_ and the most inoffensive_ cannot_ even in their innocency_ secure themselves from calumny_ reproach_ and false accusation. From these a man cannot hide himself_ but God can hide him_ so that the most malicious slanders shall be so little heeded by him as not to disturb his peace_ and so little heeded by others as not to blemish his reputation: and the remainder of wrath God can and does restrain_ for it is owing to the hold he has of the consciences of bad men that the scourge of the tongue is not the ruin of all the comforts of good men in this world.,20250223
__Thou takest all advantages against me; old scores are called over_ every infirmity is animadverted upon_ and no sooner is a false step taken than I am beaten for it.__ Now,20250223
__Though I were righteous in my own apprehension_ and my own heart did not condemn me_ yet God is greater than my heart_ and knows those secret faults and errors of mine which I do not and cannot understand_ and is able to charge me with them_ and therefore I would not answer.__ St. Paul speaks to the same purport: I know nothing by myself_ am not conscious to myself of any reigning wickedness_ and yet I am not hereby justified_ 1 Cor. iv,20250223
__Though rulers should be guilty of some errors_ yet be not_ upon all occasions_ arraigning their administration and running them down_ but make the best of them.__ Here,20250223
__To spend and revel with.__ Whether justly or not_ she insinuates that he was a bad husband; so she would represent him_ because she was resolved to be a bad wife_ and must have that for an excuse; it is often groundlessly suggested_ but is never a sufficient excuse. __He follows his pleasures_ and wastes his estate abroad__ (says she)_ __and why should not I do the same at home?__,20250223
__To trade with_ to buy goods with and he will not return till he has laid it all out. It is a pity that an honest industrious man should be thus abused_ and advantage taken of his absence_ when it is upon business_ for the good of his family.__ Or_ ,20250223
__Touch him if thou dare; remember the battle_ how unable thou art to encounter such a force_ and what is therefore likely to be the issue of the battle_ and do no more_ but desist from the attempt.__ It is good to remember the battle before we engage in a war_ and put off the harness in time if we foresee it will be to no purpose to gird it on. Job is hereby admonished not to proceed in his controversy with God_ but to make his peace with him_ remembering what the battle will certainly end in if he come to an engagement. See Isa. xxvii. 4_ 5.,20250223
__We are not so near the fountain-head of divine revelation__ (which then for aught that appears_ was conveyed by tradition) __as the former age was; and therefore we must enquire what they said and recount what we have been told of their sentiments.__ Blessed be God_ now that we have the word of God in writing_ and are directed to search that_ we need not enquire of the former age_ nor prepare ourselves to the search of their fathers; for_ though we ourselves are but of yesterday_ the word of God in the scripture is as nigh to us as it was to them (Rom. x. and it is the more sure word of prophecy_ to which we must take heed. If we study and keep God's precepts_ we may by them understand more than the ancients_ Ps. cxix. 99_ 100. ,20250223
__We do not live so long as those of the former age did_ to make observations upon the methods of divine providence_ and therefore cannot be such competent judges as they in a cause of this nature.__ Note_ The shortness of our lives is a great hindrance to the improvement of our knowledge_ and so are the frailty and weakness of our bodies. Vita brevis_ ars longa—life is short_ the progress of art boundless.,20250223
__We have what we would have. Our desires are crowned with unspeakable delights; all our griefs vanish_ and we will be glad and rejoice. If a day in the courts_ much more an hour in the chambers_ is better than a thousand_ than ten thousand_ elsewhere.__ Those that are_ through grace_ brought into covenant and communion with God_ have reason to go on their way rejoicing_ as the eunuch (Acts viii. and that joy will enlarge our hearts and be our strength_ Neh. viii,20250223
__We shall also find that which is good for food_ as well as pleasant to the eye_ all the rarities that the country affords: At our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits.__ Note_ ,20250223
__We will retain the relish and savour of this kindness of thine and never forget it: We will remember thy loves more than wine; no only thy love itself (v. but the very remembrance of it shall be more grateful to us than the strongest cordial to the spirits_ or the most palatable liquor to the taste. We will remember to give thanks for thy love_ and it shall make more durable impressions upon us than any thing in this world.__,20250223
__What you know_ the same do I know also.__,20250223
__When a few years have come_ I shall go that long journey.__ But here he corrects himself. __Why do I talk of years to come? Alas! I am just setting out on that journey_ am now ready to be offered_ and the time of my departure is at hand. My breath is already corrupt_ or broken off; my spirits are spent; I am a gone man.__ It is good for every one of us thus to look upon ourselves as dying_ and especially to think of it when we are sick. We are dying_ that is_ ,20250223
__When discovered_ thou hadst better meet a bear robbed of her whelps than the injured husband_ who_ in the case of adultery_ will be as severe an avenger of his own honour as_ in the case of manslaughter_ of his brother's blood. If thou art not afraid of the wrath of God_ yet be afraid of the rage of a man. Such jealousy is; it is strong as death and cruel as the grave. In the day of vengeance_ when the adulterer comes to be tried for his life_ the prosecutor will not spare any pains or cost in the prosecution_ will not relent towards thee_ as he would perhaps towards one that had robbed him. He will not accept of any commutation_ any composition; he will not regard any ransom. Though thou offer to bribe him_ and give him many gifts to pacify him_ he will not rest content with any thing less than the execution of the law. Thou must be stoned to death. If a man would give all the substance of his house_ it would atone for a theft (v. but not for adultery; in that case it would utterly be contemned. Stand in awe therefore_ and sin not; expose not thyself to all this misery for a moment's sordid pleasure_ which will be bitterness in the end.__,20250223
__When thou art deprived of any comfort_ suppose a child taken away by death_ or a part of thy estate lost_ say not apolesa auto—I have lost it; but apedoka—I have restored it to the right owner; but thou wilt object (says he)_ kakos ho aphelomenos—he is a bad man that has robbed me; to which he answers_ ti de soi melei—What is it to thee by what hand he that gives remands what he gave?__,20250223
__When thou walkest over thy grounds thou shalt not need to fear stumbling_ for thou shalt be at league with the stones of the field_ not to dash thy foot against any of them_ nor shalt thou be in danger from the beasts of the field_ for they shall all be at peace with thee;__ compare Hos. ii. 18_ I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field. This implies that while man is at enmity with his Maker the inferior creatures are at war with him; but tranquillus Deus tranquillat omnia—a reconciled God reconciles all things. Our covenant with God is a covenant with all the creatures that they shall do us no hurt but be ready to serve us and do us good.,20250223
__When wisdom has entire possession of thee_ it will keep thee.__ And when has it an entire possession of us? ,20250223
__Why do I stifle and smother the protestations of my innocency?__ When a man with great difficulty keeps in what he would say_ he bites his lips. __Now___ says he_ __why may not I take liberty to speak_ since I do but vex myself_ add to my torment_ and endanger my life_ by refraining?__ Note_ It would vex the most patient man_ when he has lost every thing else_ to be denied the comfort (if he deserves it) of a good conscience and a good name.,20250223
__Why do I suffer such agonies? I cannot but wonder that God should lay so much upon me when he knows I am not a wicked man.__ He was ready_ not only to rend his clothes_ but even to tear his flesh_ through the greatness of his affliction_ and saw himself at the brink of death_ and his life in his hand_ yet his friends could not charge him with any enormous crime_ nor could he himself discover any; no marvel then that he was in such confusion,20250223
__Why should I lie in temptation to turn aside_ as I do while I am absent from thee?__ We should be earnest with God for a settled peace in communion with God through Christ_ that we may not be as waifs and strays_ ready to be picked up by him that next passes by.,20250223
__Why should I lie under suspicion_ and look as if I belonged to some other and not to thee? Why should I be thought by the flocks of our companions to be a deserter from thee_ and a retainer to some other shepherd?__ Good Christians will be afraid of giving any occasion to those about them to question their faith in Christ and their love to him; they would not do any thing that looks like unconcernedness about their souls; or uncharitableness towards their brethren_ or that savours of indifference and disaffection to holy ordinances; and we should pray to God to direct us into and keep us in the way of our duty_ that we may not so much as seem to come short_ Heb. iv. 1. ,20250223
__Why___ says Elihu_ __God sometimes speaks conviction and instruction to men by such dreams___ ver. 15-18. ,20250223
__Wilt thou not pity me? Wilt thou not spare and help me_ and stand by the work of thy own hands? Ps. cxxxviii,20250223
__Yes___ says he_ __we must be asses; you are the only men.__ 2. He does himself the justice to put in his claim as a sharer in the gifts of wisdom (v. 3): __But I have understanding (a heart) as well as you; nay_ I fall not lower than you;__ as it is in the margin. __I am as well able to judge of the methods and meanings of the divine providence_ and to construe the hard chapters of it_ as you are.__ He says not this to magnify himself. It was no great applause of himself to say_ I have understanding as well as you; no_ nor to say_ __I understand this matter as well as you;__ for what reason had either he or they to be proud of understanding that which was obvious and level to the capacity of the meanest? __Yea_ who knows not such things as these? What things you have said that are true are plain truths_ and common themes_ which there are many that can talk as excellently of as either you or I.__ But he says it to humble them_ and check the value they had for themselves as doctors of the chair. Note_ ,20250223
__Yet go on_ proceed and persevere in well-doing; let slip no opportunity. In the morning sow thy seed upon the objects of charity that offer themselves early_ and in the evening do not withhold thy hand_ under pretence that thou art weary; as thou hast opportunity_ be doing good_ some way or other_ all the day long_ as the husbandman follows his seedness from morning till night. In the morning of youth lay out thyself to do good; give out of the little thou hast to begin the world with; and in the evening of old age yield not to the common temptation old people are in to be penurious; even then withhold not thy hand_ and think not to excuse thyself from charitable works by purposing to make a charitable will_ but do good to the last_ for thou knowest not which work of charity and piety shall prosper_ both as to others and as to thyself_ this or that_ but hast reason to hope that both shall be alike good. Be not weary of well-doing_ for in due season_ in God's time and that is the best time_ you shall reap___ Gal. vi,20250223
__Yonder is my servant Job; there is none like him_ none I value like him_ of all the princes and potentates of the earth; one such saint as he is worth them all: none like him for uprightness and serious piety; many do well_ but he excelleth them all; there is not to be found such great faith_ no_ not in Israel.__ Thus Christ_ long after_ commended the centurion and the woman of Canaan_ who were both of them_ like Job_ strangers to that commonwealth. The saints glory in God—Who is like thee among the gods? and he is pleased to glory in them—Who is like Israel among the people? So here_ none like Job_ none in earth_ that state of imperfection. Those in heaven do indeed far outshine him; those who are least in that kingdom are greater than he; but on earth there is not his like. There is none like him in that land; so some good men are the glory of their country,20250223
__You have heard of the patience of Job___ says the apostle_ Jam. v,20250223
__and let my offspring_ all the trees that I have planted_ be rooted out.__ This intimates that he believed the sin did deserve this punishment_ that usually it is thus punished_ but that though now his estate was ruined (and at such a time_ if ever_ his conscience would have brought his sin to his mind)_ yet he knew himself innocent and would venture all the poor remains of his estate upon the issue of the trial.,20250223
__and shake thy hands from holding them___ Isa. xxxiii,20250223
__but let it be erased and blotted out_ and buried in oblivion. Let not the world know that ever such a man as I was born into it_ and lived in it_ who am made such a spectacle of misery.__,20250223
__but that he did it purely for his own name's sake.__ Bishop Patrick expounds it thus: __If I had made supplication_ and he had granted my desire_ I would not think my prayer had done the business.__ Not for your sakes_ be it known to you. ,20250223
__but thou shalt carry it with thee into another world.__ Those that are wise for their souls are wise for themselves_ for the soul is the man; nor do any consult their own true interest but those that are truly religious. This recommends us to God_ and recovers us from that which is our folly and degeneracy; it employs us in that which is most beneficial in this world_ and entitles us to that which is much more so in the world to come. ,20250223
__meditating and praying_ then I raised thee up_ to help me and comfort me___ as the disciples raised him up in the storm_ saying_ Master_ carest thou not that we perish? (Mark iv. and the church (Ps. xliv.,20250223

(2 Chron. xxix. or (as the Jews think) his princes and ministers of state_ who were more properly called his servants_ is not certain; if the work was done by Eliakim_ and Joah_ and Shebna_ it was no diminution to their character. They copied out these proverbs from the records of Solomon's reign_ and published them as an appendix to the former edition of this book. It may be a piece of very good service to the church to publish other man's works that have lain hidden in obscurity_ perhaps a great while. Some think they culled these out of the 3000 proverbs which Solomon spoke (1 Kings iv. leaving out those that were physical_ and that pertained to natural philosophy_ and preserving such only as were divine and moral; and in this collection some observe that special regard was had to those observations which concern kings and their administration.,20250223
(2 Sam. xix. 35)_—when we shall be loaded with bodily infirmities_ old and blind_ or old and lame_—when we shall be taken off from our usefulness_ and our strength shall be labour and sorrow_—when we shall either have parted with our relations_ and all our old friends_ or be afflicted in them and see them weary of us_—when we shall feel ourselves die by inches. These years draw nigh_ when all that comes will be vanity_ the remaining months all months of vanity_ and there will be no pleasure but in the reflection of a good life on earth and the expectation of a better life in heaven.,20250223
(For from my youth he was brought up with me_ as with a father_ and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) 19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing_ or any poor without covering; 20 If his loins have not blessed me_ and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless_ when I saw my help in the gate: 22 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade_ and mine arm be broken from the bone. 23 For destruction from God was a terror to me_ and by reason of his highness I could not endure.,20250223
(Gratior est pulchro veniens de corpore virtus—Virtue appears peculiarly graceful when associated with beauty); but a foolish wanton woman_ of a light carriage_ is fitly compared to a swine_ though she be ever so handsome_ wallowing in the mire of filthy lusts_ with which the mind and conscience are defiled_ and_ though washed_ returning to them,20250223
(Ps. xii. without the least dross or alloy. Thy word is very pure_ Ps. cxix. 140. 1. It is sure_ and therefore we must trust to it and venture our souls upon it. God in his word_ God in his promise_ is a shield_ a sure protection_ to all those that put themselves under his protection and put their trust in him. The word of God_ applied by faith_ will make us easy in the midst of the greatest dangers_ Ps. xlvi. 1_ 2,20250223
(v. 1)_ she is as the lily. The beauty of believers consists in their conformity and resemblance to Jesus Christ. They are his love_ and so they are as lilies_ for those are made like Christ in whose hearts his love is shed abroad,20250223
(v. 10) to do what we have to do with all our might; but here he reminds us that_ when we have done all_ we must leave the issue with God_ and not be confident of the success.,20250223
(v. 10): But none saith_ Where is God my Maker? Afflictions are sent to direct and quicken us to enquire early after God_ Ps. lxxxviii,20250223
(v. 11): Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth_ that is_ who has endued us with more noble powers and faculties than they are endued with and has made us capable of more excellent pleasures and employments here and for ever. Now this comes in here_ ,20250223
(v. 14) or magnified (so some); they are very numerous and are raised to honour and great estates. Worldly people are said to be full of children (Ps. xvii. and_ as it is in the margin there_ their children are full. In them the parents hope to live and in their preferment to be honoured. But the more children they leave_ and the greater prosperity they leave them in_ the more and the fairer marks do they leave for the arrows of God's judgments to be levelled at_ his three sore judgments_ sword_ famine_ and pestilence_ 2 Sam. xxiv,20250223
(v. 14): If a man die_ shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait until my change come. Job's friends proving miserable comforters_ he set himself to be the more his own comforter. His case was now bad_ but he pleases himself with the expectation of a change. I think it cannot be meant of his return to a prosperous condition in this world. His friends indeed flattered him with the hopes of that_ but he himself all along despaired of it. Comforts founded upon uncertainties at best must needs be uncertain comforts; and therefore_ no doubt_ it is something more sure than that which he here bears up himself with the expectation of. The change he waits for must therefore be understood either_ ,20250223
(v. 16): How much more abominable and filthy is man! If saints are not to be trusted_ much less sinners. If the heavens are not pure_ which are as God made them_ much less man_ who is degenerated. Nay_ he is abominable and filthy in the sight of God_ and if ever he repent he is so in his own sight_ and therefore he abhors himself. Sin is an odious thing_ it makes men hateful. The body of sin is so_ and is therefore called a dead body_ a loathsome thing. Is it not a filthy thing_ and enough to make any one sick_ to see a man eating swine's food or drinking some nauseous and offensive stuff? Such is the filthiness of man that he drinks iniquity (that abominable thing which the Lord hates) as greedily_ and with as much pleasure_ as a man drinks water when he is thirsty. It is his constant drink; it is natural to sinners to commit iniquity. It gratifies_ but does not satisfy_ the appetites of the old man. It is like water to a man in a dropsy. The more men sin the more they would sin.,20250223
(v. 17): The morning is to them even as the shadow of death. The light of the day_ which is welcome to honest people_ is a terror to bad people. They curse the sun_ not as the Moors_ because it scorches them_ but because it discovers them. If one know them_ their consciences fly in their faces_ and they are ready to become their own accusers; for they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. Shame came in with sin_ and everlasting shame is at the end of it. See the misery of sinners—they are exposed to continual frights; and yet see their folly—they are afraid of coming under the eye of men_ but have no dread of God's eye_ which is always upon them: they are not afraid of doing that which yet they are so terribly afraid of being known to do.,20250223
(v. 17); it was turned aside_ v,20250223
(v. 18): __Because there is wrath__ (that is_ __because God is a righteous governor_ who resents all the affronts given to his government_ because he has revealed his wrath from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men_ and because thou hast reason to fear that thou art under God's displeasure) therefore beware lest he take thee away suddenly with his stroke_ and be so wise as to make thy peace with him quickly and get his anger turned away from thee.__ A warning to this purport Job had given his friends (ch. xix. 29): Be you afraid of the sword_ for wrath brings the punishment of the sword. Thus contenders are apt_ with too much boldness_ to bind one another over to the judgment of God and threaten one another with his wrath; but he that keeps a good conscience needs not fear the impotent menaces of proud men. But his was a friendly caution to Job_ and necessary. Even good men have need to be kept to their duty by the fear of God's wrath. __Thou art a wise and good man_ but beware lest he take thee away_ for the wisest and best have enough in them to deserve his stroke.__,20250223
(v. 19): He is chastened with pain upon his bed_ such pain as confines him to his bed_ or so extreme the pain is that he can get no ease_ no_ not on his bed_ where he would repose himself. Pain and sickness will turn a bed of down into a bed of thorns_ on which he that used to sleep now tosses to and fro till the dawning of the day. The case_ as here put_ is very bad. Pain is borne with more difficulty than sickness_ and with that the patient here is chastened_ not a dull heavy pain_ but strong and acute; and frequently the stronger the patient the stronger the pain_ for the more sanguine the complexion is the more violent_ commonly_ the disease is. It is not the smarting of the flesh that is complained of_ but the aching of the bones. It is an inward rooted pain; and not only the bones of one limb_ but the multitude of the bones_ are thus chastened. See what frail_ what vile bodies we have_ which_ though receiving no external hurt_ may be thus pained from causes within themselves. See what work sin makes_ what mischief it does. Pain is the fruit of sin; yet_ by the grace of God_ the pain of the body is often made a means of good to the soul,20250223
(v. 23): He sometimes increases their numbers_ and enlarges their bounds_ so that they make a figure among the nations and become formidable; but after a while_ by some undiscerned cause perhaps_ they are destroyed and straitened_ made few and poor_ cut short and many of them cut off_ and so they are rendered despicable among their neighbours_ and those that were the head become the tail of the nations. See Ps. cvii. 38_ 39. ,20250223
(v. 27): __Behold_ this have I found_ that is_ this I hoped to find; I thought I could have understood my errors and have brought in a complete list_ at least of the heads of them; I thought I could have counted them one by one_ and have found out the account.__ He desired to find them out as a penitent_ that he might the more particularly acknowledge them; and_ generally_ the more particular we are in the confession of sin the more comfort we have in the sense of the pardon; he desired it also as a preacher_ that he might the more particularly give warning to others. Note_ A sound conviction of one sin will put us upon enquiring into the whole confederacy; and the more we see amiss in ourselves the more diligently we should enquire further into our own faults_ that what we see not may be discovered to us_ Job xxxiv,20250223
(v. 3); he takes that from them which they have unjustly gotten; he rejects the consideration of it_ not regarding the rich more than the poor. We often see that scattered by the justice of God which has been gathered together by the injustice of men. How can the treasures of wickedness profit_ when_ though it be counted substance_ God casts it away and it vanishes as a shadow? 2. That which is honestly got will turn to a good account_ for God will bless it. Righteousness delivers from death_ that is_ wealth gained_ and kept_ and used_ in a right manner (righteousness signifies both honesty and charity); it answers the end of wealth_ which is to keep us alive and be a defence to us. It will deliver from those judgments which men bring upon themselves by their wickedness. It will profit to such a degree as to deliver_ though not from the stroke of death_ yet from the sting of it_ and consequently from the terror of it. For the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish,20250223
(v. 4) and is often ascribed to God (as Isa. lxiii. 15; Jer. xxxi. and so it denotes his tender compassion and affection for his spouse_ and the love he has to her even in her desolate and deserted state. This love of his is like bright ivory_ finely polished_ and richly overlaid with sapphires. The love itself is strong and firm_ and the instances and circumstances of it are bright and sparkling_ and add much to the inestimable value of it. ,20250223
(v. 4): __Be it indeed that I have erred_ that I am in the wrong through ignorance or mistake___ which may well be supposed concerning men_ concerning good men. Humanum est errare—Error cleaves to humanity; and we must be willing to suppose it concerning ourselves. It is folly to think ourselves infallible. __But be it so___ said Job_ __my error remaineth with myself___ that is_ __I speak according to the best of my judgment_ with all sincerity_ and not from a spirit of contradiction.__ Or_ __If I be in an error_ I keep it to myself_ and do not impose it upon others as you do. I only prove myself and my own work by it. I meddle not with other people_ either to teach them or to judge them.__ Men's errors are the more excusable if they keep them to themselves_ and do not disturb others with them. Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself. Some give this sense of these words: __If I be in an error_ it is I that must smart for it; and therefore you need not concern yourselves: nay_ it is I that do smart_ and smart severely_ for it; and therefore you need not add to my misery by your reproaches.__ 2. The breakings out of his passion_ though not justifiable_ yet were excusable_ considering the vastness of his grief and the extremity of his misery. __If you will go on to cavil at every complaining word I speak_ will make the worst of it and improve it against me_ yet take the cause of the complaint along with you_ and weigh that_ before you pass a judgment upon the complaint_ and turn it to my reproach: Know then that God has overthrown me___ v,20250223
(v. 4): __I would order my cause before him_ and set it in a true light. I would produce the evidences of my sincerity in a proper method_ and would fill my mouth with arguments to prove it.__ We may apply this to the duty of prayer_ in which we have boldness to enter into the holiest and to come even to the footstool of the throne of grace. We have not only liberty of access_ but liberty of speech. We have leave_ ,20250223
(v. 4): They are in good liking; though they are brought forth in sorrow_ after their dams have suckled them awhile they shift for themselves in the corn-fields_ and are no more burdensome to them_ which is an example to children_ when they have grown up_ not to be always hanging upon their parents and craving from them_ but to put forth themselves to get their own livelihood and to requite their parents.,20250223
(v. 4_ 10_ and force their way through rocks which are_ as it were_ the roots of the mountains_,20250223
(v. 40): __If I have got my estate unjustly_ let thistles grow instead of wheat_ the worst of weeds instead of the best of grains.__ When men get estates unjustly they are justly deprived of the comfort of them_ and disappointed in their expectations from them. They sow their land_ but they sow not that body that shall be. God will give it a body. It was sown wheat_ but shall come up thistles. What men do not come honestly by will never do them any good. Job_ towards the close of his protestation_ appeals to the judgment-seat of God concerning the truth of it (v. 35-37): O that he would hear me_ even that the Almighty would answer me! This was what he desired and often complained that he could not obtain; and_ now that he had drawn up his own defence so particularly_ he leaves it upon record_ in expectation of a hearing_ files it_ as it were_ till his cause be called.,20250223
(v. 6) from sin_ the worst of evils_ the worst of enemies; she shall keep thee from hurting thyself_ and then none else can hurt thee.__ As we say_ __Keep thy shop_ and thy shop will keep thee;__ so_ __Keep thy wisdom_ and thy wisdom will keep thee.__ It will keep us from straits and stumbling-blocks in the management of ourselves and our affairs_ v,20250223
(v. 6): In all thy ways acknowledge God. We must not only in our judgment believe that there is an over-ruling hand of God ordering and disposing of us and all our affairs_ but we must solemnly own it_ and address ourselves to him accordingly. We must ask his leave_ and not design any thing but what we are sure is lawful. We must ask his advice and beg direction from him_ not only when the case is difficult (when we know not what to do_ no thanks to us that we have our eyes up to him)_ but in every case_ be it ever so plain_ We must ask success of him_ as those who know the race is not to the swift. We must refer ourselves to him as one from whom our judgment proceeds_ and patiently_ and with a holy indifferency_ wait his award. In all our ways that prove direct_ and fair_ and pleasant_ in which we gain our point to our satisfaction_ we must acknowledge God with thankfulness. In all our ways that prove cross and uncomfortable_ and that are hedged up with thorns_ we must acknowledge God with submission. Our eye must be ever towards God; to him we must_ in every thing_ make our requests known_ as Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh_ Judg. xi,20250223
(v. 7): Thou knowest that I am not wicked. He had already owned himself a sinner_ and guilty before God; but he here stands to it that he was not wicked_ not devoted to sin_ not an enemy to God_ not a dissembler in his religion_ that he had not wickedly departed from his God_ Ps. xviii,20250223
(v. 8): __Even as I have seen_ many a time_ those that plough iniquity_ and sow wickedness_ reap accordingly; by the blast of God they perish_ v,20250223
(v. 8): Exalt wisdom (do thou but show thy good-will to her advancement) and though she needs not thy service she will abundantly recompense it_ she shall promote thee_ she shall bring thee to honour.__ Solomon was to be a king_ but his wisdom and virtue would be more his honour than his crown or purple; it was that for which all his neighbours had him so much in veneration; and no doubt_ in his reign and David's_ wise and good men stood fairest for preferment. However_ religion will_ first or last_ bring all those to honour that cordially embrace her; they shall be accepted of God_ respected by all wise men_ owned in the great day_ and shall inherit everlasting glory. This he insists on (v. 9): __She shall give to thy head an ornament of grace in this world_ shall recommend thee both to God and man_ and in the other world a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee_ a crown that shall never totter_ a crown of glory that shall never wither.__ That is the true honour which attends religion. Nobilitas sola est atique unica virtus—Virtue is the only nobility! David having thus recommended wisdom to his son_ no marvel that when God bade him ask what he would he prayed_ Lord_ give me a wise and an understanding heart. We should make it appear by our prayers how well we are taught.,20250223
(v. 9): __Hast thou an arm like God_ equal to his in length and strength? Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him_ as he did (ch. xxxvii. 1_ or does now out of the whirlwind?__ To convince Job that he was not so able as he thought himself to contest with God_ he shows him,20250223
(v. 9): I am their song and their byword. Those have a very base spirit that turn the calamities of their honest neighbours into a jest_ and can sport themselves with their griefs.,20250223
(v. 9_ 10) to be done by those oppressors that pretend law for what they do: They pluck the fatherless from the breast; that is_ having made poor infants fatherless_ they make them motherless too; having taken away the father's life_ they break the mother's heart_ and so starve the children and leave them to perish. Pharaoh and Herod plucked children from the breast to the sword; and we read of children brought forth to the murderers_ Hos. ix,20250223
(v. God knoweth the place of it; but Solomon here goes further_ and tells us both where we may find it and how we may get it. We are here told_,20250223
(v. and death was the king of all those terrors; they fought against the sinner in death's name_ for it is by reason of death that sinners are all their lifetime subject to bondage (Heb. ii. and at length they will be brought to that which they so long feared_ as a captive to the conqueror. Death is terrible to nature; our Saviour himself prayed_ Father_ save me from this hour. But to the wicked it is in a special manner the king of terrors_ both as it is a period to that life in which they placed their happiness and a passage to that life where they will find their endless misery. How happy then are the saints_ and how much indebted to the Lord Jesus_ by whom death is so far abolished_ and the property of it altered_ that this king of terrors becomes a friend and servant! ,20250223
(v. and so their righteousness delivers from death_ purely by the favour of God to them_ which is their life and livelihood_ and which will keep them alive in famine. The soul of the righteous shall be kept alive by the word of God_ and faith in his promise_ when young lions shall lack and suffer hunger.,20250223
(v. and that in this matter they were infatuated_ and their wonted wisdom had departed from them. Wisdom is a gift of God_ which he grants to some and withholds from others_ grants at some times and withholds at other times. Those that are void of compassion are so far void of understanding. Where there is not the tenderness of a man one may question whether there be the understanding of a man. ,20250223
(v. as one pleased with his own undertaking_ and that had his heart upon it and his delights with the sons of men. When he came to be baptized with the baptism of blood_ how was he straitened till it was accomplished! Luke xii,20250223
(v. but still there are secret things_ which belong not to us_ which it is not for us to pry into.,20250223
(v. by giving them discretion to keep out of harm's way_ to keep themselves that the wicked one touch them not. Note_ A principle of grace reigning in the heart will be a powerful preservative both against corruptions within and temptations without_ Eccl. ix. 16_ 18.,20250223
(v. here warns us of the by-paths into which we are in danger of being drawn aside. Those that have been well educated_ and trained up in the way they should go_ let them never turn aside into the way they should not go; let them not so much as enter into it_ no_ not to make trial of it_ lest it prove a dangerous experiment and difficult to retreat with safety. __Venture not into the company of those that are infected with the plague_ no_ not though thou think thyself guarded with an antidote.__,20250223
(v. that those of whose mind he was were such as had the earth given to them_ and to them only; they enjoyed it entirely and peaceably_ and no stranger passed among them_ either to share with them or give disturbance to them. Job had said_ The earth is given into the hand of the wicked_ ch. ix,20250223
1 A false balance is abomination to the Lord: but a just weight is his delight.,20250223
1 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. 2 It is better to go to the house of mourning_ than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. 3 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. 4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth,20250223

1 A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.,20250223
1 After this opened Job his mouth_ and cursed his day. 2 And Job spake_ and said_ 3 Let the day perish wherein I was born_ and the night in which it was said_ There is a man child conceived. 4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above_ neither let the light shine upon it,20250223
1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord_ and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord. 2 And the Lord said unto Satan_ From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord_ and said_ From going to and fro in the earth_ and from walking up and down in it. 3 And the Lord said unto Satan_ Hast thou considered my servant Job_ that there is none like him in the earth_ a perfect and an upright man_ one that feareth God_ and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity_ although thou movedst me against him_ to destroy him without cause. 4 And Satan answered the Lord_ and said_ Skin for skin_ yea_ all that a man hath will he give for his life,20250223
1 And Job answered and said_ 2 No doubt but ye are the people_ and wisdom shall die with you. 3 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea_ who knoweth not such things as these? 4 I am as one mocked of his neighbour_ who calleth upon God_ and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn,20250223
1 As snow in summer_ and as rain in harvest_ so honour is not seemly for a fool.,20250223
1 At this also my heart trembleth_ and is moved out of his place. 2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice_ and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. 3 He directeth it under the whole heaven_ and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. 4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard,20250223
1 Be not thou envious against evil men_ neither desire to be with them. 2 For their heart studieth destruction_ and their lips talk of mischief.,20250223
1 Behold_ thou art fair_ my love; behold_ thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats_ that appear from mount Gilead. 2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn_ which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins_ and none is barren among them. 3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet_ and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. 4 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury_ whereon there hang a thousand bucklers_ all shields of mighty men,20250223
1 Better is a dry morsel_ and quietness therewith_ than an house full of sacrifices with strife.,20250223
1 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity_ than he that is perverse in his lips_ and is a fool.,20250223
1 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.,20250223
1 But Job answered and said_ 2 Hear diligently my speech_ and let this be your consolations. 3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken_ mock on. 4 As for me_ is my complaint to man? and if it were so_ why should not my spirit be troubled? 5 Mark me_ and be astonished_ and lay your hand upon your mouth. 6 Even when I remember I am afraid_ and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.,20250223
1 But Job answered and said_ 2 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?,20250223
1 But Job answered and said_ 2 Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed_ and my calamity laid in the balances together! 3 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. 4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me_ the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me,20250223
1 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision_ whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. 2 Yea_ whereto might the strength of their hands profit me_ in whom old age was perished? 3 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. 4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes_ and juniper roots for their meat,20250223
1 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him_ but I found him not. 2 I will rise now_ and go about the city in the streets_ and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him_ but I found him not. 3 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said_ Saw ye him whom my soul loveth? 4 It was but a little that I passed from them_ but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him_ and would not let him go_ until I had brought him into my mother's house_ and into the chamber of her that conceived me,20250223
1 Call now_ if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn? 2 For wrath killeth the foolish man_ and envy slayeth the silly one. 3 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 4 His children are far from safety_ and they are crushed in the gate_ neither is there any to deliver them,20250223
1 Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? 2 Canst thou put a hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 3 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? 4 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 5 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 6 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? 7 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? 8 Lay thine hand upon him_ remember the battle_ do no more. 9 Behold_ the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 10 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?,20250223
1 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 2 Give a portion to seven_ and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 3 If the clouds be full of rain_ they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south_ or toward the north_ in the place where the tree falleth_ there it shall be. 4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap,20250223
1 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. 2 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. 3 Yea also_ when he that is a fool walketh by the way_ his wisdom faileth him_ and he saith to every one that he is a fool.,20250223
1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? 2 She standeth in the top of high places_ by the way in the places of the paths. 3 She crieth at the gates_ at the entry of the city_ at the coming in at the doors. 4 Unto you_ O men_ I call; and my voice is to the sons of man,20250223
1 Elihu also proceeded_ and said_ 2 Suffer me a little_ and I will show thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf. 3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar_ and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 4 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.,20250223
1 Elihu spake moreover_ and said_ 2 Thinkest thou this to be right_ that thou saidst_ My righteousness is more than God's? 3 For thou saidst_ What advantage will it be unto thee? and_ What profit shall I have_ if I be cleansed from my sin? 4 I will answer thee_ and thy companions with thee,20250223
1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.,20250223
1 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this_ that the righteous_ and the wise_ and their works_ are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them. 2 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous_ and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean_ and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth_ and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good_ so is the sinner; and he that sweareth_ as he that feareth an oath. 3 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun_ that there is one event unto all: yea_ also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil_ and madness is in their heart while they live_ and after that they go to the dead.,20250223
1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said_ 2 Hear my words_ O ye wise men; and give ear unto me_ ye that have knowledge. 3 For the ear trieth words_ as the mouth tasteth meat. 4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good,20250223
1 He_ that being often reproved hardeneth his neck_ shall suddenly be destroyed_ and that without remedy.,20250223
1 Hear_ ye children_ the instruction of a father_ and attend to know understanding. 2 For I give you good doctrine_ forsake ye not my law. 3 For I was my father's son_ tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. 4 He taught me also_ and said unto me_ Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments_ and live,20250223
1 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes_ O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels_ the work of the hands of a cunning workman. 2 Thy navel is like a round goblet_ which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies. 3 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins. 4 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon_ by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus,20250223
1 I am come into my garden_ my sister_ my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat_ O friends; drink_ yea_ drink abundantly_ O beloved.,20250223
1 I am the rose of Sharon_ and the lily of the valleys. 2 As the lily among thorns_ so is my love among the daughters.,20250223
1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? 2 For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 3 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? 4 Doth not he see my ways_ and count all my steps? 5 If I have walked with vanity_ or if my foot hath hasted to deceit,20250223
1 I said in mine heart_ Go to now_ I will prove thee with mirth_ therefore enjoy pleasure: and_ behold_ this also is vanity. 2 I said of laughter_ It is mad: and of mirth_ What doeth it? 3 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine_ yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly_ till I might see what was that good for the sons of men_ which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. 4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 5 I made me gardens and orchards_ and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: 6 I made me pools of water_ to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 7 I got me servants and maidens_ and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: 8 I gathered me also silver and gold_ and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers_ and the delights of the sons of men_ as musical instruments_ and that of all sorts. 9 So I was great_ and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. 10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them_ I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. 11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought_ and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and_ behold_ all was vanity and vexation of spirit_ and there was no profit under the sun.,20250223
1 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of a hireling? 2 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow_ and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work: 3 So am I made to possess months of vanity_ and wearisome nights are appointed to me. 4 When I lie down_ I say_ When shall I arise_ and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day,20250223
1 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God_ and be more ready to hear_ than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. 2 Be not rash with thy mouth_ and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven_ and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. 3 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.,20250223
1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 2 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 3 They bow themselves_ they bring forth their young ones_ they cast out their sorrows. 4 Their young ones are in good liking_ they grow up with corn; they go forth_ and return not unto them,20250223
1 Lo_ mine eye hath seen all this_ mine ear hath heard and understood it. 2 What ye know_ the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you. 3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty_ and I desire to reason with God. 4 But ye are forgers of lies_ ye are all physicians of no value,20250223
1 Man that is born of a woman is of few days_ and full of trouble. 2 He cometh forth like a flower_ and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow_ and continueth not. 3 And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one_ and bringest me into judgment with thee? 4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one,20250223
1 Moreover Job continued his parable_ and said_ 2 As God liveth_ who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty_ who hath vexed my soul,20250223
1 Moreover Job continued his parable_ and said_ 2 Oh that I were as in months past_ as in the days when God preserved me,20250223
1 Moreover the Lord answered Job_ and said_ 2 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God_ let him answer it. 3 Then Job answered the Lord_ and said_ 4 Behold_ I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.,20250223
1 My breath is corrupt_ my days are extinct_ the graves are ready for me. 2 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? 3 Lay down now_ put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me? 4 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them,20250223
1 My son_ attend unto my wisdom_ and bow thine ear to my understanding: 2 That thou mayest regard discretion_ and that thy lips may keep knowledge. 3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb_ and her mouth is smoother than oil: 4 But her end is bitter as wormwood_ sharp as a twoedged sword,20250223
1 My son_ forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: 2 For length of days_ and long life_ and peace_ shall they add to thee. 3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: 4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man,20250223
1 My son_ if thou be surety for thy friend_ if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger_ 2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth_ thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 3 Do this now_ my son_ and deliver thyself_ when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go_ humble thyself_ and make sure thy friend. 4 Give not sleep to thine eyes_ nor slumber to thine eyelids,20250223
1 My son_ if thou wilt receive my words_ and hide my commandments with thee,20250223
1 My son_ keep my words_ and lay up my commandments with thee. 2 Keep my commandments_ and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. 3 Bind them upon thy fingers_ write them upon the table of thine heart. 4 Say unto wisdom_ Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: 5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman_ from the stranger which flattereth with her words.,20250223
1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 2 I will say unto God_ Do not condemn me; show me wherefore thou contendest with me. 3 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress_ that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands_ and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? 4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? 5 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days_ 6 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity_ and searchest after my sin? 7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.,20250223
1 O that thou wert as my brother_ that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without_ I would kiss thee; yea_ I should not be despised. 2 I would lead thee_ and bring thee into my mother's house_ who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate. 3 His left hand should be under my head_ and his right hand should embrace me. 4 I charge you_ O daughters of Jerusalem_ that ye stir not up_ nor awake my love_ until he please.,20250223
1 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth_ while the evil days come not_ nor the years draw nigh_ when thou shalt say_ I have no pleasure in them,20250223
1 So I returned_ and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed_ and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. 2 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. 3 Yea_ better is he than both they_ which hath not yet been_ who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.,20250223
1 So these three men ceased to answer Job_ because he was righteous in his own eyes. 2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite_ of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled_ because he justified himself rather than God. 3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled_ because they had found no answer_ and yet had condemned Job. 4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken_ because they were elder than he,20250223
1 Surely there is a vein for the silver_ and a place for gold where they fine it. 2 Iron is taken out of the earth_ and brass is molten out of the stone. 3 He setteth an end to darkness_ and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness_ and the shadow of death. 4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up_ they are gone away from men,20250223
1 The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord_ as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.,20250223
1 The preparations of the heart in man_ and the answer of the tongue_ is from the Lord.,20250223
1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David_ king of Israel,20250223
1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.,20250223
1 The song of songs_ which is Solomon's.,20250223
1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.,20250223
1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh_ even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel_ even unto Ithiel and Ucal_ 2 Surely I am more brutish than any man_ and have not the understanding of a man. 3 I neither learned wisdom_ nor have the knowledge of the holy.,20250223
1 The words of king Lemuel_ the prophecy that his mother taught him. 2 What_ my son? and what_ the son of my womb? and what_ the son of my vows? 3 Give not thy strength unto women_ nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 4 It is not for kings_ O Lemuel_ it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: 5 Lest they drink_ and forget the law_ and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. 6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish_ and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. 7 Let him drink_ and forget his poverty_ and remember his misery no more. 8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. 9 Open thy mouth_ judge righteously_ and plead the cause of the poor and needy.,20250223
1 The words of the Preacher_ the son of David_ king in Jerusalem. 2 Vanity of vanities_ saith the Preacher_ vanity of vanities; all is vanity. 3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?,20250223
1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said_ 2 Can a man be profitable unto God_ as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty_ that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him_ that thou makest thy ways perfect? 4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?,20250223
1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said_ 2 If we assay to commune with thee_ wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? 3 Behold_ thou hast instructed many_ and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 4 Thy words have upholden him that was falling_ and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees,20250223
1 Then Job answered and said_ 2 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! 4 I would order my cause before him_ and fill my mouth with arguments,20250223
1 Then Job answered and said_ 2 How long will ye vex my soul_ and break me in pieces with words? 3 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me. 4 And be it indeed that I have erred_ mine error remaineth with myself,20250223
1 Then Job answered and said_ 2 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all. 3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? 4 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead_ I could heap up words against you_ and shake mine head at you,20250223
1 Then Job answered and said_ 2 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? 3 If he will contend with him_ he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 4 He is wise in heart_ and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him_ and hath prospered? 5 Which removeth the mountains_ and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. 6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place_ and the pillars thereof tremble. 7 Which commandeth the sun_ and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens_ and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. 9 Which maketh Arcturus_ Orion_ and Pleiades_ and the chambers of the south. 10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea_ and wonders without number. 11 Lo_ he goeth by me_ and I see him not: he passeth on also_ but I perceive him not. 12 Behold_ he taketh away_ who can hinder him? who will say unto him_ What doest thou? 13 If God will not withdraw his anger_ the proud helpers do stoop under him.,20250223
1 Then Job answered the Lord_ and said_ 2 I know that thou canst do every thing_ and that no thought can be withholden from thee. 3 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me_ which I knew not. 4 Hear_ I beseech thee_ and I will speak: I will demand of thee_ and declare thou unto me,20250223
1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite_ and said_ 2 Dominion and fear are with him_ he maketh peace in his high places. 3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 5 Behold even to the moon_ and it shineth not; yea_ the stars are not pure in his sight. 6 How much less man_ that is a worm? and the son of man_ which is a worm?,20250223
1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite_ and said_ 2 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark_ and afterwards we will speak. 3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts_ and reputed vile in your sight? 4 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?,20250223
1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite_ and said_ 2 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? 3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 4 If thy children have sinned against him_ and he have cast them away for their transgression,20250223
1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite_ and said_ 2 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge_ and fill his belly with the east wind? 3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? 4 Yea_ thou castest off fear_ and restrainest prayer before God,20250223
1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite_ and said_ 2 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? 3 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest_ shall no man make thee ashamed? 4 For thou hast said_ My doctrine is pure_ and I am clean in thine eyes,20250223
1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite_ and said_ 2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer_ and for this I make haste. 3 I have heard the check of my reproach_ and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. 4 Knowest thou not this of old_ since man was placed upon earth_ 5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short_ and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? 6 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens_ and his head reach unto the clouds,20250223
1 Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind_ and said_ 2 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee_ and answer thou me.,20250223
1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun_ and it is common among men: 2 A man to whom God hath given riches_ wealth_ and honour_ so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth_ yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof_ but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity_ and it is an evil disease. 3 If a man beget a hundred children_ and live many years_ so that the days of his years be many_ and his soul be not filled with good_ and also that he have no burial; I say_ that an untimely birth is better than he. 4 For he cometh in with vanity_ and departeth in darkness_ and his name shall be covered with darkness,20250223
1 There was a man in the land of Uz_ whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright_ and one that feared God_ and eschewed evil. 2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep_ and three thousand camels_ and five hundred yoke of oxen_ and five hundred she asses_ and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.,20250223
1 These are also proverbs of Solomon_ which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.,20250223
1 Through desire a man_ having separated himself_ seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.,20250223
1 To every thing there is a season_ and a time to every purpose under the heaven: 2 A time to be born_ and a time to die; a time to plant_ and a time to pluck up that which is planted,20250223
1 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler_ consider diligently what is before thee: 2 And put a knife to thy throat_ if thou be a man given to appetite. 3 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.,20250223
1 Wherefore_ Job_ I pray thee_ hear my speeches_ and hearken to all my words. 2 Behold_ now I have opened my mouth_ my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. 4 The Spirit of God hath made me_ and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life,20250223
1 Whither is thy beloved gone_ O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee. 2 My beloved is gone down into his garden_ to the beds of spices_ to feed in the gardens_ and to gather lilies. 3 I am my beloved's_ and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.,20250223
1 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine_ and the boldness of his face shall be changed. 2 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment_ and that in regard of the oath of God. 3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 4 Where the word of a king is_ there is power: and who may say unto him_ What doest thou? 5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.,20250223
1 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish.,20250223
1 Why_ seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty_ do they that know him not see his days? 2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks_ and feed thereof. 3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless_ they take the widow's ox for a pledge. 4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together,20250223
1 Wine is a mocker_ strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.,20250223
1 Wisdom hath builded her house_ she hath hewn out her seven pillars: 2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. 3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city_ 4 Whoso is simple_ let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding_ she saith to him_ 5 Come_ eat of my bread_ and drink of the wine which I have mingled. 6 Forsake the foolish_ and live; and go in the way of understanding. 7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot. 8 Reprove not a scorner_ lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man_ and he will love thee. 9 Give instruction to a wise man_ and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man_ and he will increase in learning. 10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. 11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied_ and the years of thy life shall be increased. 12 If thou be wise_ thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest_ thou alone shalt bear it.,20250223
1)_ Jeremiah the doctrine of his righteousness (Jer. xii. 1)_ another prophet that of his holiness (Hab. i. the psalmist that of his goodness and peculiar favour to his own people (Ps. lxxiii. 1)_ and that is it which Solomon here fastens upon and resolves to abide by_ that_ though good and evil seem to be dispensed promiscuously_ yet God has a particular care of and concern for his own people: The righteous and the wise_ and their works_ are in the hand of God_ under his special protection and guidance; all their affairs are managed by him for their good; all their wise and righteous actions are in his hand_ to be recompensed in the other world_ though not in this. They seem as if they were given up into the hand of their enemies_ but it is not so. Men have no power against them but what is given them from above. The events that affect them do not come to pass by chance_ but all according to the will and counsel of God_ which will turn that to be for them which seemed to be most against them. Let this make us easy_ whatever happens_ that all God's saints are in his hand_ Deut. xxxiii. 3; John x. 29; Ps. xxxi. 15.,20250223
1)_ and he also rejoiced always before him. This may be understood either,20250223
1. __Be not averse to it. Let grace conquer the antipathy which nature has to suffering_ and reconcile thyself to the will of God in it.__ We need the rod and we deserve it; and therefore we ought not to think it either strange or hard if we feel the smart of it. Let not the heart rise against a bitter pill or potion_ when it is prescribed for our good,20250223
1. __Consider the character of the men whose way thou art warned to shun.__ They are mischievous men (v. 16_ 17); they not only care not what hurt they do to those that stand in their way_ but it is their business to do mischief_ and their delight_ purely for mischief-sake. They are continually designing and endeavouring to cause some to fall_ to ruin them body and soul. Wickedness and malice are in their nature_ and violence is in all their actions. They are spiteful in the highest degree; for_ ,20250223
1. __Thou canst not tame him_ nor bind him with his band_ nor set him to draw the harrow___ v,20250223
1. A good man seeks the favour of God in the first place_ is ambitious of the honour of being accepted of the Lord_ and he shall find that favour_ and with it a good understanding; God will make the best of him_ and put a favourable construction upon what he says and does. He shall be owned as one of Wisdom's children_ and shall have praise with God_ as one having that good understanding which is ascribed to all those that do his commandments,20250223
1. A holy confidence towards God: __Then shalt thou lift up thy face towards heaven without spot; thou mayest come boldly to the throne of grace_ and not with that terror and amazement expressed___ ch. ix,20250223
1. A humble petition for a hiding-place in the grave_ v,20250223
1. A man cut down by death will not revive again_ as a tree cut down will. What hope there is of a tree he shows very elegantly_ v. 7-9. If the body of the tree be cut down_ and only the stem or stump left in the ground_ though it seem dead and dry_ yet it will shoot out young boughs again_ as if it were but newly planted. The moisture of the earth and the rain of heaven are_ as it were_ scented and perceived by the stump of a tree_ and they have an influence upon it to revive it; but the dead body of a man would not perceive them_ nor be in the least affected by them. In Nebuchadnezzar's dream_ when his being deprived of the use of his reason was signified by the cutting down of a tree_ his return to it again was signified by the leaving of the stump in the earth with a band of iron and brass to be wet with the dew of heaven_ Dan. iv,20250223
1. A merciful_ tender_ good humoured man_ does good to his own soul_ makes and keeps himself easy. He has the pleasure of doing his duty_ and contributing to the comfort of those that are to him as his own soul; for we are members one of another. He that waters others with his temporal good things shall find that God will water him with his spiritual blessings_ which will do the best good to his own soul. See Isa. lviii. 7_ &c. If thou hide not thy eyes from thy own flesh_ but do good to others_ as to thyself_ if thou do good with thy own soul and draw that out to the hungry_ thou wilt do good to thy own soul; for the Lord shall satisfy thy soul and make fat thy bones. Some make it part of the character of a merciful man_ that he will make much of himself; that disposition which inclines him to be charitable to others will oblige him to allow himself also that which is convenient and to enjoy the good of all his labour. We may by the soul understand the inward man_ as the apostle calls it_ and then it teaches us that the first and great act of mercy is to provide well for our own souls the necessary supports of the spiritual life,20250223
1. A poor man by his wisdom comes to be preferred_ as Joseph_ who_ when he was but young_ was brought out of prison to be the second man in the kingdom_ to which story Solomon seems here to refer. Providence sometimes raises the poor out of the dust_ to set them among princes_ Ps. cxiii. 7_ 8. Wisdom has wrought not only the liberty of men_ but their dignity_ raised them from the dunghill_ from the dungeon_ to the throne,20250223
1. A precept which makes it our duty to serve God with our estates: Honour the Lord with thy substance. It is the end of our creation and redemption to honour God_ to be to him for a name and a praise; we are no other way capable of serving him than in his honour. His honour we must show forth and the honour we have for him. We must honour him_ not only with our bodies and spirits which are his_ but with our estates too_ for they also are his: we and all our appurtenances must be devoted to his glory. Worldly wealth is but poor substance_ yet_ such as it is_ we must honour God with it_ and then_ if ever_ it becomes substantial. We must honour God_ ,20250223
1. A vow is a bond upon the soul (Num. xxx. by which we solemnly oblige ourselves_ not only_ in general_ to do that which we are already bound to do_ but_ in some particular instances_ to do that to do which we were not under any antecedent obligation_ whether it respects honouring God or serving the interests of his kingdom among men. When_ under the sense of some affliction (Ps. lxvi. or in the pursuit of some mercy (1 Sam. i. thou hast vowed such a vow as this unto God_ know that thou hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord and thou canst not go back; therefore_,20250223
1. After Job had almost lost himself in the labyrinth of the divine counsels_ how contentedly does he sit down_ at length_ with this thought: __Though I know not the way that he takes (for his way is in the sea and his path in the great waters_ his thoughts and ways are infinitely above ours and it would be presumption in us to pretend to judge of them)_ yet he knows the way that I take___,20250223
1. All that are sanctified have a rooted antipathy to wickedness and wicked people. They have a good will to the souls of all (God has_ and would have none perish); but they hate the ways and practices of those that are impious towards God and injurious towards men; they cannot hear of them nor speak of them without a holy indignation; they loathe the society of the ungodly and unjust_ and dread the thought of giving them any countenance_ but do all they can to bring the wickedness of the wicked to an end. Thus an unjust man makes himself odious to the just_ and it is one part of his present shame and punishment that good men cannot endure him,20250223
1. An ironical concession to the vanities and pleasures of youth: Rejoice_ O young man! in thy youth. Some make this to be the counsel which the atheist and the epicure give to the young man_ the poisonous suggestions against which Solomon_ in the close of the verse_ prescribes a powerful antidote. But it is more emphatic if we take it_ as it is commonly understood_ by way of irony_ like that of Elijah to the priests of Baal (Cry aloud_ for he is a god)_ or of Micaiah to Ahab (Go to Ramoth-Gilead_ and prosper)_ or of Christ to his disciples_ Sleep on now. __Rejoice_ O young man! in thy youth_ live a merry life_ follow thy sports_ and take thy pleasures; let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth_ cheer thee with its fancies and foolish hopes; entertain thyself with thy pleasing dreams; walk in the ways of thy heart; do whatever thou hast a mind to do_ and stick at nothing that may gratify the sensual appetite. Quicquid libet_ licet—Make thy will thy law. Walk in the ways of thy heart_ and let thy heart walk after thy eyes_ a rambling heart after a roving eye; what is pleasing in thy own eyes do it_ whether it be pleasing in the eyes of God or no.__ Solomon speaks thus ironically to the young man to intimate_ ,20250223
1. As absurd as it would be to advance one to power that is a professed enemy to justice: Shall even he that hates right govern? v,20250223
1. As in an agreeable bride_ adorned for her husband (Rev. xxi. who greatly desires her beauty_ Ps. xlv,20250223
1. As springs to this lower world_ the source and treasure of its moisture_ and the great bank through which it circulates—a very necessary provision_ for its stagnation would be as hurtful to this lower world as that of the blood to the body of man. It is worth while to observe in this common occurrence_ ,20250223
1. As to his particular conduct under this affliction. He charges him with weakness and faint-heartedness_ and this article of his charge there was too much ground for_ v. 3-5. And here_,20250223
1. As we read this verse_ it shows why good men_ when they come to understand things aright_ will not envy the prosperity of evil-doers. When they see the house of the wicked_ how full it is perhaps of all the good things of this life_ they are tempted to envy; but when they wisely consider it_ when they look upon it with an eye of faith_ when they see God overthrowing the wicked for their wickedness_ that there is a curse upon their habitation which will certainly be the ruin of it ere long_ they see more reason to despise them_ or pity them_ than to fear or envy them,20250223
1. As we read this_ it intimates_ in short_ that angry men never want woe. Those that are of strong_ or rather headstrong_ passions_ commonly bring themselves and their families into trouble by vexatious suits and quarrels and the provocations they give; they are still smarting_ in one instance or other_ for their ungoverned heats; and_ if their friends deliver them out of one trouble_ they will quickly involve themselves in another_ and they must do it again_ all which troubles to themselves and others would be prevented if they would mortify their passions and get the rule of their own spirits,20250223
1. Because the hypocrite's hopes will not be crowned (v. 8): For what is the hope of the hypocrite? Bildad had condemned it (ch. viii. 13_ and Zophar (ch. xi. and Job here concurs with them_ and reads the death of the hypocrite's hope with as much assurance as they had done; and this fitly comes in as a reason why he would not remove his integrity_ but still hold it fast. Note_ The consideration of the miserable condition of wicked people_ and especially hypocrites_ should engage us to be upright (for we are undone_ for ever undone_ if we be not) and also to get the comfortable evidence of our uprightness; for how can we be easy if the great concern lie at uncertainties? Job's friends would persuade him that all his hope was but the hope of the hypocrite_ ch. iv,20250223
1. By the kind visit they paid him in his affliction_ to mourn with him and to comfort him_ v.,20250223
1. Death is insatiable. The first death_ the second death_ both are so. The grave is not clogged with the multitude of dead bodies that are daily thrown into it_ but is still an open sepulchre_ and cries_ Give_ give. Hell also has enlarged itself_ and still has room for the damned spirits that are committed to that prison. Tophet is deep and large_ Isa. xxx. 33,20250223
1. Do it quickly_ ,20250223
1. Elihu spoke because he was angry and thought he had good cause to be so. When he had made his observations upon the dispute he did not go away and calumniate the disputants_ striking them secretly with a malicious censorious tongue_ but what he had to say he would say before their faces_ that they might vindicate themselves if they could. ,20250223
1. Eliphaz branches out this charge into divers particulars_ with as much assurance as if he could call witnesses to prove upon oath every article of it. He tells him_ ,20250223
1. Eliphaz charges this upon Job_ either_ ,20250223
1. Eliphaz referred to an important truth_ which he thought_ if Job had duly considered it_ would have prevented him from being so passionate in his complaints and bold in justifying himself (v.,20250223
1. For the simple_ to give subtlety to them. The instructions here given are plain and easy_ and level to the meanest capacity_ the wayfaring men_ though fools_ shall not err therein; and those are likely to receive benefit by them who are sensible of their own ignorance and their need to be taught_ and are therefore desirous to receive instruction; and those who receive these instructions in their light and power_ though they be simple_ will hereby be made subtle_ graciously crafty to know the sin they should avoid and the duty they should do_ and to escape the tempter's wiles. He that is harmless as the dove by observing Solomon's rules may become wise as the serpent; and he that has been sinfully foolish when he begins to govern himself by the word of God becomes graciously wise.,20250223
1. From the kingdom of nature_ in which the God of nature acts with an uncontrollable power and does what he pleases; for all the orders and all the powers of nature are derived from him and depend upon him.,20250223
1. God has wisdom to bestow_ v,20250223
1. God is almighty_ and able to deal with the strongest of men when he enters into judgment with them (v. 20); even the people_ the body of a nation_ though ever so numerous_ shall be troubled_ unhinged_ and put into disorder_ when God pleases; even the mighty man_ the prince_ though ever so honourable_ ever so formidable among men_ shall_ if God speak the word_ be taken away out of his throne_ nay_ out of the land of the living; they shall die; they shall pass away. What cannot he do that has all the powers of death at his command? Observe the suddenness of this destruction: In a moment shall they die. It is not a work of time_ with God_ to bring down his proud enemies_ but_ when he pleases_ it is soon done; nor is he bound to give them warning_ no_ not an hour's warning. This night thy soul shall be required. Observe the season of it: They shall be troubled at midnight_ when they are secure and careless_ and unable to help themselves; as the Egyptians when their first-born were slain. This is the immediate work of God: they are taken away_ without hand_ insensibly_ by secret judgments. God can himself humble the greatest tyrant_ without the assistance or agency of any man. Whatever hand he sometimes uses in the accomplishing of his purposes_ he needs none_ but can do it without hand. Nor is it one single mighty man only that he can thus overpower_ but even hosts of them (v. 24): He shall break in pieces mighty men without number; for no combined power can stand it out against Omnipotence. Yet_ when God destroys tyranny_ he does not design anarchy; if those are brought down that ruled ill_ it does not therefore follow that people must have no rulers; for_ when he breaks mighty men_ he sets others in their stead_ that will rule better_ or_ if they do not_ he overturns them also in the night_ or in a night_ so that they are destroyed_ v,20250223
1. God my makers_ in the plural number_ which some think is_ if not an indication_ yet an intimation_ of the Trinity of persons in the unity of the Godhead. Let us make man. ,20250223
1. Great droughts are sometimes great judgments: He withholds the waters_ and they dry up; if the heaven be as brass_ the earth is as iron; if the rain be denied_ fountains dry up and their streams are wanted_ fields are parched and their fruits are wanted_ Amos iv. 7,20250223
1. Guide thy heart in the way_ v,20250223
1. He believes the glory of the Redeemer and his own interest in him (v. 25): I know that my Redeemer liveth_ that he is in being and is my life_ and that he shall stand at last_ or stand the last_ or at the latter day_ upon (or above) the earth. He shall be raised up_ or_ He shall be_ at the latter day_ (that is_ in the fulness of time: the gospel day is called the last time because that is the last dispensation) upon the earth: so it points at his incarnation; or_ He shall be lifted up from the earth (so it points at his crucifixion)_ or raised up out of the earth (so it is applicable to his resurrection)_ or_ as we commonly understand it_ At the end of time he shall appear over the earth_ for he shall come in the clouds_ and every eye shall see him_ so close shall he come to this earth. He shall stand upon the dust (so the word is)_ upon all his enemies_ which shall be put a dust under his feet; and he shall tread upon them and triumph over them. Observe here_ ,20250223
1. He called her his love and his fair one. Whatever she is to others_ to him she is acceptable_ and in his eyes she is amiable. Those that take Christ for their beloved_ he will own as his; never was any love lost that was bestowed upon Christ. Christ_ by expressing his love to believers_ invites and encourages them to follow him.,20250223
1. He calls her his love (v. 9); it is an endearing compellation often used in this book: __My friend_ my companion_ my familiar.__ 2. He compares her to a set of strong and stately horses in Pharaoh's chariots. Egypt was famous for the best horses. Solomon had his thence; and Pharaoh_ no doubt_ had the choicest the country afforded for his own chariots. The church had complained of her own weakness_ and the danger she was in of being made a prey of by her enemies: __Fear not___ says Christ; __I have made thee like a company of horses; I have put strength into thee as I have done into the horse (Job xxxix. so that thou shalt with a gracious boldness mock at fear_ and not be affrighted_ like the lion_ Prov. xxviii. 1. The Lord has made thee as his goodly horse in the day of battle_ Zech. x,20250223
1. He complains of the strictness of God's judgment and the rigour of his proceedings against him_ and is ready to call it summum jus—justice bordering on severity. That he took all advantages against him: __If I sin_ then thou markest me_ v,20250223
1. He does not flatter her_ nor design hereby either to make her proud of herself or to court her praises of him; but_ ,20250223
1. He foresees_ with comfort_ that death will be the period of all his calamities (v. 24): Though God now_ with a strong hand_ opposed himself against him_ __yet___ says he_ __he will not stretch out his hand to the grave.__ The hand of God's wrath would bring him to death_ but would not follow him beyond death; his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits_ his body safe and easy in the dust. Though men cry in his destruction (though_ when they are dying_ there is a great deal of agony and out-cry_ many a sigh_ and groan_ and complaint)_ yet in the grave they feel nothing_ they fear nothing_ but all is quiet there. __Though in hell_ which is called destruction_ they cry_ yet not in the grave; and_ being delivered from the second death_ the first to me will be an effectual relief.__ Therefore he wished he might be hidden in the grave_ ch. xiv. 13,20250223
1. He found that his searches after knowledge were very toilsome_ and a weariness not only to the flesh_ but to the mind (v. 13): This sore travail_ this difficulty that there is in searching after truth and finding it_ God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted therewith_ as a punishment for our first parents' coveting forbidden knowledge. As bread for the body_ so that for the soul_ must be got and eaten in the sweat of our face_ whereas both would have been had with out labour if Adam had not sinned.,20250223
1. He gave himself much to building_ both in the city and in the country; and_ having been at such vast expense in the beginning of his reign to build a house for God_ he was the more excusable if afterwards he pleased his own fancy in building for himself; he began his work at the right end (Matt. vi. not as the people (Hag. i. that ceiled their own houses while God's lay waste_ and it prospered accordingly. In building_ he had the pleasure of employing the poor and doing good to posterity. We read of Solomon's buildings (1 Kings ix. 15-19)_ and they were all great works_ such as became his purse_ and spirit_ and great dignity. See his mistake; he enquired after the good works he should do (v. and_ in pursuit of the enquiry_ applied himself to great works. Good works indeed are truly great_ but many are reputed great works which are far from being good_ wondrous works which are not gracious_ Matt. vii. 22.,20250223
1. He gives instances of disappointment_ even where means and instruments were most encouraging and promised fair. ,20250223
1. He had 500 yoke of oxen_ and 500 she-asses_ and a competent number of servants to attend them; and all these he lost at once_ v. 14_ 15. The account he has of this lets him know_ ,20250223
1. He had kept a conscience void of offence_ ,20250223
1. He had observed many such rulers_ v,20250223
1. He has given him riches_ wealth_ and honour_ v,20250223
1. He has no true delight in it; it is only to please his friends or save his credit; he does not love his book_ nor his business_ nor his Bible_ nor his prayers; he would rather be playing the fool with his sports. Those who take no pleasure in learning or religion will make nothing to purpose of either. No progress is made in them if they are a task and a drudgery,20250223
1. He humbled himself under the hand of God_ and accommodated himself to the providences he was under_ as one that knew how to want as well as how to abound. When God called to weeping and mourning he wept and mourned_ rent his mantle and shaved his head; and_ as one that abased himself even to the dust before God_ he fell down upon the ground_ in a penitent sense of sin and a patient submission to the will of God_ accepting the punishment of his iniquity. Hereby he showed his sincerity; for hypocrites cry not when God binds them_ ch. xxxvi,20250223
1. He insists not on his own judgment and that of his companions: We are but of yesterday_ and know nothing_ v,20250223
1. He is an incomprehensible Being_ infinite and immense_ whose nature and perfections our finite understandings cannot possibly form any adequate conceptions of_ and whose counsels and actings we cannot therefore_ without the greatest presumption_ pass a judgment upon. We that are so little acquainted with the divine nature are incompetent judges of the divine providence; and_ when we censure the dispensations of it_ we talk of things that we do not understand. We cannot find out God; how dare we then find fault with him? Zophar here shows_ ,20250223
1. He is so sure of the equity of God's tribunal that he longs to appear before it (v. 3): O that I knew where I might find him! This may properly express the pious breathings of a soul convinced that it has by sin lost God and is undone for ever if it recover not its interest in his favour. __O that I knew how I might recover his favour! How I might come into his covenant and communion with him!__ Mic. vi. 6_ 7. It is the cry of a poor deserted soul. __Saw you him whom my soul loveth? O that I knew where I might find him! O that he who has laid open the way to himself would direct me into it and lead me in it!__ But Job here seems to complain too boldly that his friends wronged him and he knew not which way to apply himself to God to have justice done him_ else he would go even to his seat_ to demand it. A patient waiting for death and judgment is our wisdom and duty_ and_ if we duly consider things_ that cannot be without a holy fear and trembling; but a passionate wishing for death or judgment_ without any such fear and trembling_ is our sin and folly_ and ill becomes us. Do we know what death and judgment are_ and are we so very ready for them_ that we need not time to get readier? Woe to those that thus_ in a heat_ desire the day of the Lord_ Amos,20250223
1. He knew so much of God that he durst not stand a trial with him_ v. 15-19. He knew how to make his part good with his friends_ and thought himself able to deal with them; but_ though his cause had been better than it was_ he knew it was to no purpose to debate it with God. ,20250223
1. He lays down this truth_ that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge (v. 7); it is the principal part of knowledge (so the margin); it is the head of knowledge; that is_ ,20250223
1. He owns that God can do every thing. What can be too hard for him that made behemoth and leviathan_ and manages both as he pleases? He knew this before_ and had himself discoursed very well upon the subject_ but now he knew it with application. God had spoken it once_ and then he heard it twice_ that power belongs to God; and therefore it is the greatest madness and presumption imaginable to contend with him. __Thou canst do every thing_ and therefore canst raise me out of this low condition_ which I have so often foolishly despaired of as impossible: I now believe thou art able to do this.__ 2. That no thought can be withholden from him_ that is_ ,20250223
1. He recites the words which Job had spoken_ as nearly as he can remember. ,20250223
1. He recommends to his consideration God's almighty power and sovereign dominion. In general_ he doeth great things (v. great indeed_ for he can do any thing_ he doth do every thing_ and all according to the counsel of his own will—great indeed_ for the operations of his power are_,20250223
1. He reproves sinners for their folly and their obstinately persisting in it_ v,20250223
1. He saw just men to whom it happened according to the work of the wicked_ who_ notwithstanding their righteousness_ suffered very hard things_ and continued long to do so_ as if they were to be punished for some great wickedness,20250223
1. He shall be disappointed in his expectations_ and shall not find that satisfaction in his worldly wealth which he vainly promised himself (v. 17): He shall never see the rivers_ the floods_ the brooks of honey and butter_ with which he hoped to glut himself. The world is not that to those who love it_ and court it_ and admire it_ which they fancy it will be. The enjoyment sinks far below the raised expectation.,20250223
1. He shows how little the angels themselves are in comparison with God_ v,20250223
1. He speaks of himself as wanting a righteousness_ and having done foolishly_ very foolishly. When he reflects upon himself he owns_ Surely I am more brutish than any man. Every man has become brutish_ Jer. x,20250223
1. He speaks of sinners in general_ politic busy sinners_ that take pains in sin_ for they plough iniquity; and expect gain by sin_ for they sow wickedness. Those that plough plough in hope_ but what is the issue? They reap the same. They shall of the flesh reap corruption and ruin_ Gal. vi. 7_,20250223
1. He takes it for granted that parents will_ with all the wisdom they have_ instruct their children_ and_ with all the authority they have_ give law to them for their good. They are reasonable creatures_ and therefore we must not give them law without instruction; we must draw them with the cords of a man_ and when we tell them what they must do we must tell them why. But they are corrupt and wilful_ and therefore with the instruction there is need of a law. Abraham will not only catechize_ but command_ his household. Both the father and the mother must do all they can for the good education of their children_ and all little enough.,20250223
1. He thinks it unbecoming the goodness of God_ and the mercifulness of his nature_ to deal so hardly with his creature as to lay upon him more than he can bear (v. 3): Is it good unto thee that thou shouldst oppress? No_ certainly it is not; what he approves no in men (Lam. iii. 34-36) he will not do himself. __Lord_ in dealing with me_ thou seemest to oppress thy subject_ to despise thy workmanship_ and to countenance thy enemies. Now_ Lord_ what is the meaning of this? Such is thy nature that this cannot be a pleasure to thee; and such is thy name that it cannot be an honour to thee. Why then dealest thou thus with me? What profit is there in my blood?__ Far be it from Job to think that God did him wrong_ but he is quite at a loss how to reconcile his providences with his justice_ as good men have often been_ and must wait until the day shall declare it. Let us therefore now harbour no hard thoughts of God_ because we shall then see there was no cause for them.,20250223
1. He valued himself by the interest he had in the esteem_ affections_ and prayers_ of sober people; not by the studied panegyrics of the wits and poets_ but the unconstrained praises of all about him. All that heard what he said_ and saw what he did_ how he laid out himself for the public good with all the authority and tender affection of a father to his country_ blessed him_ and gave witness to him_ v,20250223
1. He was a dying man_ v. 1. He had said (ch. xvi.,20250223
1. He was jealous over them with a godly jealousy; and so we ought to be over ourselves and those that are dearest to us_ as far as is necessary to our care and endeavour for their good. Job had given his children a good education_ had comfort in them and good hope concerning them; and yet he said_ __It may be_ my sons have sinned in the days of their feasting more than at other times_ have been too merry_ have taken too great a liberty in eating and drinking_ and have cursed God in their hearts___ that is_ __have entertained atheistical or profane thoughts in their minds_ unworthy notions of God and his providence_ and the exercises of religion.__ When they were full they were ready to deny God_ and to say_ Who is the Lord? (Prov. xxx. ready to forget God and to say_ The power of our hand has gotten us this wealth_ Deut. viii. 12_ &c. Nothing alienates the mind more from God than the indulgence of the flesh.,20250223
1. Hence he observes the great usefulness and excellency of wisdom_ and what a blessing it makes men to their country: Wisdom is better than strength_ v,20250223
1. Her feet are here praised; the feet of Christ's ministers are beautiful in the eyes of the church (Isa. lii. and her feet are here said to be beautiful in the eyes of Christ. How beautiful are thy feet with shoes! When believers_ being made free from the captivity of sin (Acts xii. stand fast in the liberty with which they are made free_ preserve the tokens of their enfranchisement_ have their feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace_ and walk steadily according to the rule of the gospel_ then their feet are beautiful with shoes; they tread firmly_ being well armed against the troubles they meet with in their way. When we rest not in good affections_ but they are accompanied with sincere endeavors and resolutions_ then our feet are beautified with shoes. See Ezek. xvi. 10,20250223
1. His body is very strong and well built. His strength is in his loins_ v,20250223
1. His days were useless_ and had been so a great while. He was wholly taken off from business_ and utterly unfit for it. Every day was a burden to him_ because he was in no capacity of doing good_ or of spending it to any purpose. Et vitæ partem non attigit ullam—He could not fill up his time with any thing that would turn to account. This he calls possessing months of vanity_ v,20250223
1. His enquiry concerning the evil of sin. He applied his heart to know the wickedness of folly_ even of foolishness and madness. Observe_ ,20250223
1. His love is now his dove; David had called the church God's turtle-dove (Ps. lxxxiv. and so she is here called; a dove for beauty_ her wings covered with silver (Ps. xviii. for innocence and inoffensiveness; a gracious spirit is a dove-like spirit_ harmless_ loving quietness and cleanliness_ and faithful to Christ_ as the turtle to her mate. The Spirit descended like a dove on Christ_ and so he does on all Christians_ making them of a meek and quiet spirit. She is Christ's dove_ for he owns her and delights in her; she can find no rest but in him and his ark_ and therefore to him_ as her Noah_ she returns.,20250223
1. His posterity will be rooted out: The increase of his house shall depart_ shall either be cut off by untimely deaths or forced to run their country. Numerous and growing families_ if wicked and vile_ are soon reduced_ dispersed_ and extirpated_ by the judgments of God,20250223
1. His searches were industrious. God had given him a capacity for knowledge above any; he set up with a great stock of wisdom; he had the largest opportunities of improving himself that ever any man had; and_ ,20250223
1. How Job describes it_ and what construction he puts upon their discourses with him. He looks upon himself as basely abused by them. ,20250223
1. How a man of Belial is here described. He is a wicked man_ that makes a trade of doing evil_ especially with his tongue_ for he walks and works his designs with a froward mouth (v. by lying and perverseness_ and a direct opposition to God and man. He says and does every thing_ ,20250223
1. How far Job kept from this sin. He not only never bowed the knee to Baal (which_ some think_ was designed to represent the sun)_ never fell down and worshipped the sun_ but he kept his eye_ his heart_ and his lips_ clean from this sin. ,20250223
1. How great God is. He has a sovereign dominion over the waters_ has appointed them their course_ even then when they seem to overflow and to be from under his check_ v He has divided a water-course_ directs the rain where to fall_ even when the shower is most violent_ with as much certainty as if it were conveyed by canals or conduit-pipes. Thus the hearts of kings are said to be in God's hand; and as the rains_ those rivers of God_ he turns them whithersoever he will. Every drop goes as it is directed. God has sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more return to cover the earth; and we see that he is able to make good what he has promised_ for he has the rain in a water-course.,20250223
1. How he resented the temptation. He was very indignant at having such a thing mentioned to him: __What! Curse God? I abhor the thought of it. Get thee behind me_ Satan.__ In other cases Job reasoned with his wife with a great deal of mildness_ even when she was unkind to him (ch. xix. 17): I entreated her for the children's sake of my own body. But_ when she persuaded him to curse God_ he was much displeased: Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. He does not call her a fool and an atheist_ nor does he break out into any indecent expressions of his displeasure_ as those who ar sick and sore are apt to do_ and think they may be excused; but he shows her the evil of what she said_ and she spoke the language of the infidels and idolaters_ who_ when they are hardly bestead_ fret themselves_ and curse their king and their God_ Isa. viii,20250223
1. How honourably God speaks of Job: He is my servant. Good men are God's servants_ and he is pleased to reckon himself honoured in their services_ and they are to him for a name and a praise (Jer. xiii. 11) and a crown of glory_ Isa. lxii,20250223
1. How the duty of subjects is here described. ,20250223
1. How the saints are described. ,20250223
1. How this doctrine is introduced_ v. 4_ where he appeals_ ,20250223
1. How various the circumstances of people's dying are. There is one way into the world_ we say_ but many out; yet_ as some are born by quick and easy labour_ others by that which is hard and lingering_ so dying is to some much more terrible than to others; and_ since the death of the body is the birth of the soul into another world_ death-bed agonies may not unfitly be compared to child-bed throes. Observe the difference. ,20250223
1. If brethren dwell together in unity_ if they are friendly_ and hearty_ and pleasant_ both in their daily meals and in more solemn entertainments_ that will make a dinner of herbs a feast sufficient; though the fare be coarse_ and the estate so small that they can afford no better_ yet love will sweeten it and they may be as merry over it as if they had all dainties,20250223
1. If he looked at home_ he found he had a good foundation. His stock was all his own_ and none of all his neighbours had any demand upon him. He found no bodily distemper growing upon him; his estate did not lie under any incumbrance; nor was he sensible of any worm at the root of it. He was getting forward in his affairs_ and not going behind-hand; he lost no reputation_ but gained rather; he knew no rival that threatened either to eclipse his honour or abridge his power. See how he describes this_ v. 19_ 20. He was like a tree whose root is not only spread out_ which fixes it and keeps it firm_ so that it is in no danger of being overturned_ but spread out by the waters_ which feed it_ and make it fruitful and flourishing_ so that it is in no danger of withering. And_ as he thought himself blessed with the fatness of the earth_ so also with the kind influences of heaven too; for the dew lay all night upon his branch. Providence favoured him_ and made all his enjoyments comfortable and all his enterprises successful. Let none think to support their prosperity with what they draw from this earth without that blessing which is derived from above. God's favour being continued to Job_ in the virtue of that his glory was still fresh in him. Those about him had still something new to say in his praise_ and needed not to repeat the old stories: and it is only by constant goodness that men's glory is thus preserved fresh and kept from withering and growing stale. His bow also was renewed in his hand_ that is_ his power to protect himself and annoy those that assailed him still increased_ so that he thought he had as little reason as any man to fear the insults of the Sabeans and Chaldeans.,20250223
1. If his affliction was thus borne_ ,20250223
1. If we look about us_ to the earth and waters here below_ we shall see striking instances of omnipotence_ which we may gather out of these verses. ,20250223
1. In dispute (v. 3): If he will contend with him_ either at law or at an argument_ he cannot answer him one of a thousand. ,20250223
1. In general (v. 10_,20250223
1. In general (v. 16): With him are strength and reason (so some translate it)_ strength and consistency with himself: it is an elegant word in the original. With him are the very quintessence and extract of wisdom. With him are power and all that is; so some read it. He is what he is of himself_ and by him and in him all things subsist. Having this strength and wisdom_ he knows how to make use_ not only of those who are wise and good_ who willingly and designedly serve him_ but even of those who are foolish and bad_ who_ one would think_ could be made no way serviceable to the designs of his providence: The deceived and the deceiver are his; the simplest men that are deceived are not below his notice; the subtlest men that deceive cannot with all their subtlety escape his cognizance. The world is full of deceit; the one half of mankind cheats the other_ and God suffers it to be so_ and from both will at last bring glory to himself. The deceivers make tools of the deceived_ but the great God makes tools of them both_ wherewith he works_ and none can hinder him. He has wisdom and might enough to manage all the fools and knaves in the world_ and knows how to serve his own purposes by them_ notwithstanding the weakness of the one and the wickedness of the other. When Jacob by a fraud got the blessing the design of God's grace was served; when Ahab was drawn by a false prophecy into an expedition that was his ruin the design of God's justice was served; and in both the deceived and the deceiver were at his disposal. See Ezek. xiv,20250223
1. In general_ it was a day of great affliction and sorrow. ,20250223
1. In his present afflicted state troubles were continually felt_ and were likely to be so. He thought he had cause enough to be weary of living_ for_ ,20250223
1. It embroils men in quarrels_ makes them quarrel with others_ and say and do that which gives others occasion to quarrel with them_ v,20250223
1. It is a precept; so we take it_ like that (ch. ii. 10_,20250223
1. It is a transcendent happiness_ more than can be found in the wealth of this world_ if we had ever so much of it_ v. 14_ 15. It is not only a surer_ but a more gainful merchandise to trade for wisdom_ for Christ_ and grace_ and spiritual blessings_ than for silver_ and gold_ and rubies. Suppose a man to have got these in abundance_ nay_ to have all the things he can desire of this world (and who is it that ever had?)_ yet_ ,20250223
1. It is an honour to parents when they are old to leave children_ and children's children_ growing up_ that tread in the steps of their virtues_ and are likely to maintain and advance the reputation of their families. It is an honour to a man to live so long as to see his children's children (Ps. cxxviii. 6; Gen. l. to see his house built up in them_ and to see them likely to serve their generation according to the will of God. This crowns and completes their comfort in this world,20250223
1. It is both the proof and the praise of a man's wisdom and goodness that he speaks wisely and well. A good man_ in his discourse_ brings forth wisdom for the benefit of others. God gives him wisdom as a reward of his righteousness (Eccl. ii. and he_ in gratitude for that gift and justice to the giver_ does good with it_ and with his wise and pious discourses edifies many. He knows what is acceptable_ what discourse will be pleasing to God (for that is it that he studies more than to oblige the company)_ and what will be agreeable both to the speaker and to the hearers_ what will become him and benefit them_ and that he will speak,20250223
1. It is hard to be found out: there is but here and there a vein for the silver_ v. 1. The precious stones_ though bright themselves_ yet_ because buried in obscurity and out of sight_ are called stones of darkness and the shadow of death. Men may search long before they light on them,20250223
1. It is here repeated_ because it is a sin that God doubly hates (as lying_ which is of the same nature with this sin_ is mentioned twice among the seven things that God hates_ ch. vi. 17_ and because it was probably a sin very much practised at that time in Israel_ and therefore made light of as if there were no harm in it_ under pretence that_ being commonly used_ there was no trading without it,20250223
1. It is not substantial and satisfying: __Wilt thou be such a fool as to set thy eyes_ to cause thy eyes to fly with eagerness and violence_ upon that which is not?__ Note_ ,20250223
1. It is plain before our eyes_ nothing more obvious: it is what men behold. Every man that has but half an eye may see it_ may behold it afar off. Look which way we will_ we see the productions of God's wisdom and power; we see that done_ and that doing_ concerning which we cannot but say_ This is the work of God_ the finger of God; it is the Lord's doing. Every man may see_ afar off_ the heaven and all its lights_ the earth and all its fruits_ to be the work of Omnipotence; much more when we behold them nigh at hand. Look at the minutest works of nature through a microscope; do they not appear curious? The eternal power and godhead of the Creator are clearly seen and understood by the things that are made_ Rom. i,20250223
1. It is this that directs us in speaking_ that teaches the mouth what to speak_ and when_ and how_ so that what is spoken may be proper_ and pertinent_ and seasonable; otherwise_ though the language be ever so fine_ it had better be unsaid,20250223
1. It shows who those are that are hastening to poverty_ those that have so little consideration as to be bound for every body that will ask them and those that are given to women. Such as these will take up money as far as ever their credit will go_ but they will certainly cheat their creditors at last_ nay_ they are cheating them all along. An honest man may be made a beggar_ but he is not honest that makes himself one,20250223
1. It was a word of caution to them not to proceed and persist in their unkind usage of him_ v.,20250223
1. Job had an eye to God in his repentance_ thought highly of him_ and went upon that as the principle of it (v. 5): __I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear many a time from my teachers when I was young_ from my friends now of late. I have known something of thy greatness_ and power_ and sovereign dominion; and yet was not brought_ by what I heard_ to submit myself to thee as I ought. The notions I had of these things served me only to talk of_ and had not a due influence upon my mind. But now thou hast by immediate revelation discovered thyself to me in thy glorious majesty; now my eyes see thee; now I feel the power of those truths which before I had only the notion of_ and therefore now I repent_ and unsay what I have foolishly said.__ Note_ ,20250223
1. Job is greatly magnified and comes off with honour. He was but one against three_ a beggar now against three princes_ and yet_ having God on his side_ he needed not fear the result_ though thousands set themselves against him. Observe here_ ,20250223
1. Job seems to speak here_ ,20250223
1. Job was far from revenge. He did not only not return the injuries that were done him_ not only not destroy those who hated him; but_ ,20250223
1. Let him not make light of divine vengeance_ nor be secure_ as if he were in no danger of it,20250223
1. Let him tell where he was when this lower world was made_ and whether he was advising of assisting in that wonderful work (v. 4): __Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Thy pretensions are high; canst thou pretend to his? Wast thou present when the world was made?__ See here_ ,20250223
1. Let magistrates see to it that they never punish the just_ that they be in no case a terror to good works_ for that is to abuse their power and betray that great trust which is reposed in them. It is not good_ that is_ it is a very evil thing_ and will end ill_ whatever end they may aim at in it. When princes become tyrants and persecutors their thrones will be neither easy nor firm,20250223
1. Let neither prince nor people violently attempt any changes_ nor make a forcible entry upon a national settlement_ for they will both find it of dangerous consequence_ which he shows here by four similitudes_ the scope of which is to give us a caution not to meddle to our own hurt. Let not princes invade the rights and liberties of their subjects; let not subjects mutiny and rebel against their princes; for_ ,20250223
1. Let them consider what a God he is into whose service they had thus thrust themselves_ and to whom they really did so much disservice_ and enquire whether they could give him a good account of what they did. Consider_ ,20250223
1. Let them know wherein true wisdom consists_ and what will be their entertainment at Wisdom's table_ v,20250223
1. Let us relish the comforts of life while we live_ and cheerfully take our share of the enjoyments of it. Solomon_ having been himself ensnared by the abuse of sensitive delights_ warns others of the danger_ not by a total prohibition of them_ but by directing to the sober and moderate use of them; we may use the world_ but must not abuse it_ take what is to be had out of it_ and expect no more. Here we have_,20250223
1. Let young men marry_ marry and not burn. Have a cistern_ a well of thy own (v. even the wife of thy youth_ v,20250223
1. Men retire to their houses from their labours in the field_ and keep within doors (v. 7): He seals up the hand of every man. In frost and snow_ husbandmen cannot follow their business_ nor some tradesmen_ nor travellers_ when the weather is extreme. The plough is laid by_ the shipping laid up_ nothing is to be done_ nothing to be got_ that men_ being taken off from their own work_ may know his work_ and contemplate that_ and give him the glory of that_ and_ by the consideration of that work of his in the weather which seals up their hands_ be led to celebrate his other great and marvellous works. Note_ When we are_ upon any account_ disabled from following our worldly business_ and taken off from it_ we should spend our time rather in the exercises of piety and devotion (in acquainting ourselves with the works of God and praising him in them) than in foolish idle sports and recreations. When our hands are sealed up our hearts should be thus opened_ and the less we have at any time to do in the world the more we should thereby be driven to our Bibles and our knees,20250223
1. Now she knows very well where he is (v. 2): __My beloved is not to be found in the streets of the city_ and the crowd and noise that are there; there I have in vain looked for him__ (as his parents sought him among their kindred and acquaintance_ and found him not); __but he has gone down to his garden_ a place of privacy and retirement.__ The more we withdraw from the hurry of the world the more likely we are to have acquaintance with Christ_ who took his disciples into a garden_ there to be witnesses of the agonies of his love. Christ's church is a garden enclosed_ and separated from the open common of the world; it is his garden_ which he has planted as he did the garden of Eden_ which he takes care of_ and delights in. Though he had gone up to the paradise above_ yet he comes down to his garden on earth; it lies low_ but he condescends to visit it_ and wonderful condescension it is. Will God in very deed dwell with man upon the earth? Those that would find Christ may expect to meet with him in his garden the church_ for there he records his name (Exod. xx. 24); they must attend upon him in the ordinances which he has instituted_ the word_ sacraments_ and prayer_ wherein he will be with us always_ even to the end of the world. The spouse here refers to what Christ had said (ch. v. 1)_ I have come into my garden. It is as if she had said_ __What a fool was I to fret and fatigue myself in seeking him where he was not_ when he himself had told me where he was!__ Words of direction and comfort are often out of the way when we have occasion to use them_ till the blessed Spirit brings them to our remembrance_ and then we wonder how we overlooked them. Christ has told us that he would come into his garden; thither therefore we must go to seek him. The beds_ and smaller gardens_ in this greater_ are the particular churches_ the synagogues of God in the land (Ps. lxxxiv. 8); the spices and lilies are particular believers_ the planting of the Lord_ and pleasant in his eyes. When Christ comes down to his church it is_ ,20250223
1. Of the comfort_ or grief_ parents have in their children_ according as they are wise or foolish_ godly or ungodly_ ch. x. 1; xv. 20; xvii. 21_ 25; xix. 13_ 26; xxiii. 15_ 16_ 24_ 25; xxvii. 11; xxix.,20250223
1. She asserts her own comeliness notwithstanding (v. 5): I am black_ but comely_ black as the tents of Kedar_ in which the shepherds lived_ which were very coarse_ and never whitened_ weather-beaten and discoloured by long use_ but comely as the curtains of Solomon_ the furniture of whose rooms_ no doubt_ was sumptuous and rich_ in proportion to the stateliness of his houses. The church is sometimes black with persecution_ but comely in patience_ constancy_ and consolation_ and never the less amiable in the eyes of Christ_ black in the account of men_ but comely in God's esteem_ black in some that are a scandal to her_ but comely in others that are sincere and are an honour to her. True believers are black in themselves_ but comely in Christ_ with the comeliness that he puts upon them_ black outwardly_ for the world knows them not_ but all glorious within_ Ps.,20250223
1. She assures them_ in general_ that he is one of incomparable perfections and unparalleled worth (v. 10): __Do not you know my beloved? Can the daughters of Jerusalem be ignorant of him that is Jerusalem's crown and crowned head? Let me tell you then___ ,20250223
1. She comforts herself with the thoughts of the mutual interest and relation that were between her and her beloved: My beloved to me and I to him_ so the original reads it very emphatically; the conciseness of the language speaks the largeness of her affection: __What he is to me and I to him may better be conceived than expressed.__ Note_ ,20250223
1. She courted him to sup with her (v. 14_ 15): I have peace-offerings with me. Hereby she gives him to understand_ ,20250223
1. She did not open to him at his first knock_ and now she came too late_ when afterwards she would have inherited this blessing. Christ will be sought while he may be found; if we slip our time_ we may lose our passage. Note_ ,20250223
1. She doubts not but that the day will break and the shadows will flee away. The gospel-day will dawn_ and the shadows of the ceremonial law will flee away. This was the comfort of the Old-Testament church_ that_ after the long night of that dark dispensation_ the day-spring from on high would at length visit them_ to give light to those that sit in darkness. When the sun rises the shades of the night vanish_ so do the shadows of the day when the substance comes. The day of comfort will come after a night of desertion. Or it may refer to the second coming of Christ_ and the eternal happiness of the saints; the shadows of our present state will flee away_ our darkness and doubts_ our griefs and all our grievances_ and a glorious day shall dawn_ a morning when the upright shall have dominion_ a day that shall have no night after it,20250223
1. She excels them all. Go through all the world_ and view the societies of men that reckon themselves wise and happy_ kingdoms_ courts_ senates_ councils_ or whatever incorporations you may think valuable_ they are none of them to be compared with the church of Christ; their honours and beauties are nothing to hers. Who is like unto thee_ O Israel! Deut. xxxiii. 29; iv. 6_ 7. There are particular persons_ as virgins without number_ who are famed for their accomplishments_ the beauties of their address_ language_ and performances_ but the beauty of holiness is beyond all other beauty: __My dove_ my undefiled_ is one_ has that one beauty that she is a dove_ an undefiled dove_ and mine_ and that makes her excel the queens and virgins_ though they were ever so many.__ 2. She included them all. __Other kings have many queens_ and concubines_ and virgins_ with whose conversation they entertain themselves_ but my dove_ my undefiled_ is to me instead of all; in that one I have more than they have in all theirs.__ Or_ __Though there are many particular churches_ some of greater dignity_ others of less_ some of longer_ others of shorter_ standing_ and many particular believers_ of different gifts and attainments_ some more eminent_ others less so_ yet they all constitute but one catholic church_ are all but parts of that whole_ and that is my dove_ my undefiled.__ Christ is the centre of the church's unity; all the children of God that are scattered abroad are gathered by him (John xi. and meet in him (Eph. i. and are all his doves.,20250223
1. She has the comfort and satisfaction of her virtue in her own mind (v. 25): Strength and honour are her clothing_ in which she wraps herself_ that is_ enjoys herself_ and in which she appears to the world_ and so recommends herself. She enjoys a firmness and constancy of mind_ has spirit to bear up under the many crosses and disappointments which even the wise and virtuous must expect to meet with in this world; and this is her clothing_ for defence as well as decency. She deals honourably with all_ and she has the pleasure of doing so_ and shall rejoice in time to come; she shall reflect upon it with comfort_ when she comes to be old_ that she was not idle or useless when she was young. In the day of death it will be a pleasure to her to think that she has lived to some good purpose. Nay_ she shall rejoice in an eternity to come; she shall be recompensed for her goodness with fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.,20250223
1. She hears him speak: __It is the voice of my beloved_ calling me to tell me he is coming.__ Like one of his own sheep_ she knows his voice before she sees him_ and can easily distinguish it from the voice of a stranger (John x. 4_ and_ like a faithful friend of the bridegroom_ she rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice_ John iii,20250223
1. She is as a lily; he himself is the lily,20250223
1. She is very industrious to recommend herself to her husband's esteem and affection. Those that are good really will be good relatively. A good woman_ if she be brought into the marriage state_ will be a good wife_ and make it her business to please her husband_ 1 Cor. vii,20250223
1. She promises him her best affections; and_ whatever else she had for him_ it would utterly be contemned if her heart were not entire for him: __There therefore will I give thee my love; I will repeat the professions of it_ honour thee with the tokens of it; and the out-goings of my soul towards thee in adorations and desires shall be quickened and enlarged_ and my heart offered up to thee in a holy fire.__ 2. She promises him her best provision_ v,20250223
1. She puts him in mind of the former experience which she and others had had of comfort and success in applying to him. ,20250223
1. Some take these for Christ's words (v. 12): My vineyard_ which is mine_ is before me; and they observe how he dwells upon his property in it: It is my vineyard_ which is mine; so dear is his church to him_ it is his own in the world (John xiii. 1)_ and therefore he will always have it under his protection; it is his own_ and he will look after it,20250223
1. Some understand this of God and of his works_ which are both incomparable and unsearchable. He challenges all mankind to give an account of the heavens above_ of the winds_ the waters_ the earth: __Who can pretend to have ascended up to heaven_ to take a view of the orbs above_ and then to have descended_ to give us a description of them? Who can pretend to have had the command of the winds_ to have grasped them in his hand and managed them_ as God does_ or to have bound the waves of the sea with a swaddling band_ as God has done? Who has established the ends of the earth_ or can describe the strength of its foundations or the extent of its limits? Tell me what is the man's name who can undertake to vie with God or to be of his cabinet-council_ or_ if he be dead_ what is his name to whom he has bequeathed this great secret.__ 2. Others refer it to Christ_ to Ithiel and Ucal_ the Son of God_ for it is the Son's name_ as well as the Father's_ that is here enquired after_ and a challenge given to any to vie with him. We must now exalt Christ as one revealed; they then magnified him as one concealed_ as one they had heard something of but had very dark and defective ideas of. We have heard the fame of him with our ears_ but cannot describe him (Job xxviii. 22); certainly it is God that has gathered the wind in his fists and bound the waters as in a garment; but what is his name? It is_ I am that I am (Exod. iii. a name to be adored_ not to be understood. What is his Son's name_ by whom he does all these things? The Old-Testament saints expected the Messiah to be the Son of the Blessed_ and he is here spoken of as a person distinct from the Father_ but his name as yet secret. Note_ The great Redeemer_ in the glories of his providence and grace_ can neither be paralleled nor found out to perfection. ,20250223
1. Some will say that what they have is their own and they have it for their own use_ and will ask_ Why should we cast it thus upon the waters? Why should I take my bread_ and my flesh_ and give it to I know not whom? So Nabal pleaded_ 1 Sam. xxv,20250223
1. Sometimes giving vent to grief gives ease; but_ __Though I speak__ (says Job)_ __my grief is not assuaged_ my spirit is never the lighter for the pouring out of my complaint; nay_ what I speak is so misconstrued as to be turned to the aggravation of my grief.__ 2. At other times keeping silence makes the trouble the easier and the sooner forgotten; but (says Job) though I forbear I am never the nearer; what am I eased? If he complained he was censured as passionate; if not_ as sullen. If he maintained his integrity_ that was his crime; if he made no answer to their accusations_ his silence was taken for a confession of his guilt.,20250223
1. Sometimes he prefers good people to places of trust and honour (v. 7): With kings are they on the throne_ and every sheaf is made to bow to theirs. When righteous persons are advanced to places of honour and power_ it is in mercy to them; for God's grace in them will both arm them against the temptations that attend preferment and enable them to improve the opportunity it gives them of doing good. It is also in mercy to those over whom they are set: When the righteous bear rule the city rejoices. If the righteous be advanced_ they are established. Those that in honour keep a good conscience stand upon sure ground_ and high places are not such slippery ground to them as they are to others. But_ because it is not often that we see good men made great men in this world_ this may be supposed to refer to the honour to which the righteous shall rise when their Redeemer shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; for then only they shall be exalted for ever_ and established for ever; then shall they all shine forth as the sun_ and be made kings and priests to our God.,20250223
1. That God made us_ he_ and not our parents_ who were only the instruments of his power and providence in our production. He made us_ and not we ourselves. His hands have made and fashioned these bodies of ours and every part of them (v. and they are fearfully and wonderfully made. The soul also_ which animates the body_ is his gift. Job takes notice of both here. ,20250223
1. That God's counsels are immutable: He is in one mind_ and who can turn him? He is one (so some read it) or in one; he has no counsellors by whose interest he might be prevailed with to alter his purpose: he has no counsellors by whose interest he might be prevailed with to alter his purpose: he is one with himself_ and never alters his mind_ never alters his measures. Prayer has prevailed to change God's way and his providence_ but never was his will or purpose changed; for known unto God are all his works,20250223
1. That he had never been wanting to do good to them_ as there was occasion_ to the utmost of his ability. He was always compassionate to the poor_ and careful of them_ especially the widows and fatherless_ that were destitute of help. ,20250223
1. That he is indebted to none of his creatures. If any pretend he is indebted to them_ let them make their demand and prove their debt_ and they shall receive it in full and not by composition: __Who has prevented me?__ that is_ __who has laid any obligations upon me by any services he has done me? Who can pretend to be before-hand with me? If any were_ I would not long be behind-hand with them; I would soon repay them.__ The apostle quotes this for the silencing of all flesh in God's presence_ Rom. xi,20250223
1. That he might be delivered from the sting of his afflictions_ which is sin: __Do not condemn me; do not separate me for ever from thee. Though I lie under the cross_ let me not lie under the curse; though I smart by the rod of a Father_ let me not be cut off by the sword of a Judge. Thou dost correct me; I will bear that as well as I can; but O do not condemn me!__ It is the comfort of those who are in Christ Jesus that_ though they are in affliction_ there is no condemnation to them_ Rom. viii. 1. Nay_ they are chastened of the Lord that they may not be condemned with the world_ 1 Cor. xi,20250223
1. That his estate should prosper_ and temporal blessings should be bestowed abundantly on him; for godliness has the promise of the life that now is. It is promised_,20250223
1. That his former sins_ long since committed_ should now be remembered against him_ and he should he reckoned with for the old scores (v. 26): Thou writest bitter things against me. Afflictions are bitter things. Writing them denotes deliberation and determination_ written as a warrant for execution; it denotes also the continuance of his affliction_ for that which is written remains_ and_ __Herein thou makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth___ that is_ __thou punishest me for them_ and thereby puttest me in mind of them_ and obligest me to renew my repentance for them.__ Note_ ,20250223
1. That man is a rational creature_ and therefore that every man has for himself a judgment of discretion and ought to be allowed a liberty of speech in his turn. He means the same that Job did (ch. xii. 3_ But I have understanding as well as you) when he says (v.,20250223
1. That our steps be not straitened when we go_ that we bring not ourselves into such straits as David was in_ 2 Sam. xxiv,20250223
1. That the stage was clear_ and he did not break in upon any of the managers on either side: They were amazed (v. 15); they stood still_ and answered no more_ v,20250223
1. That they are all vanity_ v,20250223
1. That we do not listen to the charms of this sin. It is true the lips of a strange woman drop as a honey-comb (v. 3); the pleasures of fleshly lust are very tempting (like the wine that gives its colour in the cup and moves itself aright); its mouth_ the kisses of its mouth_ the words of its mouth_ are smoother than oil_ that the poisonous pill may go down glibly and there may be no suspicion of harm in it. But consider_ ,20250223
1. That we ought to have some business to do in this world and not to live in idleness,20250223
1. That which is here condemned is meddling with strife that belongs not to us. If we must not be hasty to strive in our own cause (ch. xxv. much less in other people's_ especially theirs that we are no way related to or concerned in_ but light on accidentally as we pass by. If we can be instrumental to make peace between those that are at variance we must do it_ though we should thereby get the ill-will of both sides_ at least while they are in their heat; but to make ourselves busy in other men's matters_ and parties in other men's quarrels_ is not only to court our own trouble_ but to thrust ourselves into temptation. Who made me a judge? Let them end it_ as they began it_ between themselves,20250223
1. The absurdity here censured is singing songs to a heavy heart. Those that are in great sorrow are to be comforted by sympathizing with them_ condoling with them_ and concurring in their lamentation. If we take that method_ the moving of our lips may assuage their grief (Job xvi. 5); but we take a wrong course with them if we think to relieve them by being merry with them_ and endeavouring to make them merry; for it adds to their grief to see their friends so little concerned for them; it puts them upon ripping up the causes of their grief_ and aggravating them_ and makes them harden themselves in sorrow against the assaults of mirth,20250223
1. The bridegroom's friendship (v. 2): __Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth_ that is_ be reconciled to me_ and let me know that he is so; let me have the token of his favour.__ Thus the Old-Testament church desired Christ's manifesting himself in the flesh_ to be no longer under the law as a schoolmaster_ under a dispensation of bondage and terror_ but to receive the communications of divine grace in the gospel_ in which God is reconciling the world unto himself_ binding up and healing what by the law was torn and smitten; as the mother kisses the child that she has chidden.,20250223
1. The church is called Shulamite_ referring either to Solomon_ the bridegroom in type_ by whose name she is called_ in token of her relation to him and union with him (thus believers are called Christians from Christ)_ or referring to Salem_ the place of her birth and residence_ as the woman of Shunem is called the Shunamite. Heaven is the Salem whence the saints have their birth_ and where they have their citizenship; those that belong to Christ_ and are bound for heaven_ shall be called Shulamites,20250223
1. The confidence of an unfaithful man (so some read it) will be like a broken tooth; his policy_ his power_ his interest_ all that which he trusted in to support him in his wickedness_ will fail him in time of trouble_ Ps. lii. 7,20250223
1. The darkness he is wrapped up in is a hidden darkness: it is all darkness_ utter darkness_ without the least mixture of light_ and it is hid in his secret place_ whither he has retreated and where he hopes to shelter himself; he never retires into his own conscience but he finds himself in the dark and utterly at a loss,20250223
1. The disease with which Job was seized was very grievous: Satan smote him with boils_ sore boils_ all over him_ from head to foot_ with an evil inflammation (so some render it)_ an erysipelas_ perhaps_ in a higher degree. One boil_ when it is gathering_ is torment enough_ and gives a man abundance of pain and uneasiness. What a condition was Job then in_ that had boils all over him_ and no part free_ and those as of raging a heat as the devil could make them_ and_ as it were_ set on fire of hell! The small-pox is a very grievous and painful disease_ and would be much more terrible than it is but that we know the extremity of it ordinarily lasts but a few days; how grievous then was the disease of Job_ who was smitten all over with sore boils or grievous ulcers_ which made him sick at heart_ put him to exquisite torture_ and so spread themselves over him that he could lie down no way for any ease. If at any time we be exercised with sore and grievous distempers_ let us not think ourselves dealt with any otherwise than as God has sometimes dealt with the best of his saints and servants. We know not how much Satan may have a hand (by divine permission) in the diseases with which the children of men_ and especially the children of God_ are afflicted_ what infections that prince of the air may spread_ what inflammations may come from that fiery serpent. We read of one whom Satan had bound many years_ Luke xiii,20250223
1. The first three are natural things_ and are only designed as comparisons for the illustration of the last. We cannot trace_ ,20250223
1. The great difference that there is between the characters of the righteous and the wicked_ which_ in several instances_ are set the one over-against the other_ to show that_ though all things come alike to all_ yet that does not in the least confound the eternal distinction between moral good and evil_ but that remains immutable. ,20250223
1. The hopes and joys of the hypocrite are here compared to a rush or flag_ v. 11-13. ,20250223
1. The humble reverence believers have for Christ as their Sovereign_ v,20250223
1. The judge will not judge aright_ will not use his power well_ but will abuse it; instead of doing good with it he will do hurt with it_ and then it is not only vanity_ but a lie_ a cheat to himself and to all about him_ v,20250223
1. The justice Job is here challenged to do_ and that is to bring the proud low with a look. If Job will pretend to be a rival with God_ especially if he pretend to be a judge of his actions_ he must be able to do this.,20250223
1. The lusts of the flesh_ here called the sins of his youth (v. 11); for those are the sins which_ at that age_ people are most tempted to. The forbidden pleasures of sense are said to be sweet in his mouth (v. 12); he indulges himself in all the gratifications of the carnal appetite_ and takes an inordinate complacency in them_ as yielding the most agreeable delights. That is the satisfaction which he hides under his tongue_ and rolls there_ as the most dainty delicate thing that can be. He keeps it still within his mouth (v. 13); let him have that_ and he desires no more; he will never part with that for the spiritual and divine pleasures of religion_ which he has no relish or nor affection for. His keeping it still in his mouth denotes his obstinately persisting in his sin (he spares it when he should kill and mortify it_ and forsakes it not_ but holds it fast_ and goes on frowardly in it)_ and also his re-acting of his sin by revolving it and remembering it with pleasure_ as that adulterous woman (Ezek. xxiii. 19) who multiplied her whoredoms by calling to remembrance the days of her youth; so does this wicked man here. Or his hiding it and keeping it under his tongue denotes his industrious concealment of his beloved lust. Being a hypocrite_ his haunts of sin are secret_ that he may save the credit of his profession; but he who knows what is in the heart knows what is under the tongue too_ and will discover it shortly.,20250223
1. The master he is sent to school to: Go to the ant_ to the bee_ so the LXX. Man is taught more than the beasts of the earth_ and made wiser that the fowls of heaven_ and yet is so degenerated that he may learn wisdom from the meanest in sects and be shamed by them. When we observe the wonderful sagacities of the inferior creatures we must not only give glory to the God of nature_ who has made them thus strangely_ but receive instruction to ourselves; by spiritualizing common things_ we may make the things of God both easy and ready to us_ and converse with them daily.,20250223
1. The matter of fact is taken for granted_ for we see instances of it every day. ,20250223
1. The more men have the more they would have_ v,20250223
1. The novelty of the invention_ that it is such as was never known before. How grateful is it to think that none ever made such advances in knowledge_ and such discoveries by it_ as we_ that none ever made such improvements of an estate or trade_ and had the art of enjoying the gains of it_ as we have. Their contrivances and compositions are all despised and run down_ and we boast of new fashions_ new hypotheses_ new methods_ new expressions_ which jostle out the old_ and put them down. But this is all a mistake: The thing that is_ and shall be_ is the same with that which has been_ and that which shall be done will be but the same with that which is done_ for there is no new thing under the sun_ v,20250223
1. The particular expressions which Job used in cursing his day are full of poetical fancy_ flame_ and rapture_ and create as much difficulty to the critics as the thing itself does to the divines: we need not be particular in our observations upon them. When he would express his passionate wish that he had never been_ he falls foul upon the day_ and wishes_,20250223
1. The parts of his body_ the power he exerts_ especially when he is set upon_ and the comely proportion of the whole of him_ are what God will not conceal_ and therefore what we must observe and acknowledge the power of God in. Though he is a creature of monstrous bulk_ yet there is in him a comely proportion. In our eye beauty lies in that which is small (inest sua gratia parvis—little things have a gracefulness all their own) because we ourselves are so; but in God's eye even the leviathan is comely; and_ if he pronounce even the whale_ event he crocodile_ so_ it is not for us to say of any of the works of his hands that they are ugly of ill-favoured; it is enough to say so_ as we have cause_ of our own works. God here goes about to give us an anatomical view (as it were) of the leviathan; for his works appear most beautiful and excellent_ and his wisdom and power appear most in them_ when they are taken in pieces and viewed in their several parts and proportions. ,20250223
1. The pious reflections Job makes upon his own life and death. Such plain truths as these concerning the shortness and vanity of life_ the unavoidableness and irrecoverableness of death_ then do us good when we think and speak of them with application to ourselves. Let us consider then_ ,20250223
1. The preacher_ which intimates his present character. He is Koheleth_ which comes from a word which signifies to gather; but it is of a feminine termination_ by which perhaps Solomon intends to upbraid himself with his effeminacy_ which contributed more than any thing to his apostasy; for it was to please his wives that he set up idols_ Neh. xiii,20250223
1. The pretence he makes for his slothfulness: He hides his hand in his bosom for fear of cold; next to his warm bed in his warm bosom. Or he pretends that he is lame_ as some do that make a trade of begging; something ails his hand; he would have it thought that it is blistered with yesterday's hard work. Or it intimates_ in general_ his aversion to business; he has tried_ and his hands are not used to labour_ and therefore he hugs himself in his own ease and cares for nobody. Note_ It is common for those that will not do their duty to pretend they cannot. I cannot dig_ Luke xvi. 3,20250223
1. The sayings of wisdom must be our principles by which we must govern ourselves_ our monitors to warn us of duty and danger; and therefore_ ,20250223
1. The similitude is very elegant_ v. 15-20. ,20250223
1. The spouse proposes her case with a compassionate concern (v. 8): We have a little sister and she has no breasts (she has not grown up to maturity); what shall we do for this little sister of ours in the day that she shall be spoken for_ so as that we may do well for her? ,20250223
1. The unsearchable depth of God's counsels. Zophar cannot pretend to do it_ but he desires that God himself would show Job so much of the secrets of the divine wisdom as might convince him that they are at least double to that which is_ v,20250223
1. The uses to be gathered from the house of mourning are_ ,20250223
1. The way of saints is pleasant and agreeable: Good understanding gains favour with God and man; our Saviour grew in that favour when he increased in wisdom. Those that conduct themselves prudently_ and order their conversation aright in every thing_ that serve Christ in righteousness_ and peace_ and joy in the Holy Ghost_ are accepted of God and approved of men_ Rom. xiv. 17_ 18. And how comfortably will that man pass through the world who is well understood and is therefore well accepted! 2. The way of sinners is rough and uneasy_ and_ for this reason_ unpleasant to themselves_ because unacceptable to others. It is hard_ hard upon others_ who complain of it_ hard to the sinner himself_ who can have little enjoyment of himself while he is doing that which is disobliging to all mankind. The service of sin is perfect slavery_ and the road to hell is strewed with the thorns and thistles that are the products of the curse. Sinners labour in the very fire.,20250223
1. Their gold and silver serve to steel them_ to make them more insolent_ and more impudent_ in their wickedness. Now he mentions this either_ ,20250223
1. These she calls ours_ Christ and believers having a joint-interest in them. As husband and wife are heirs together (1 Pet. iii. so believers are joint-heirs with Christ_ Rom. viii,20250223
1. They are amiable as the light_ the most beautiful of all visible things. Christians are_ or should be_ the lights of the world. The patriarchal church looked forth as the morning when the promise of the Messiah was first made known_ and the day-spring from on high visited this dark world. The Jewish church was fair as the moon; the ceremonial law was an imperfect light; it shone by reflection; it was changing as the moon_ did not make day_ nor had the sun of righteousness yet risen. But the Christian church is clear as the sun_ exhibits a great light to those that sat in darkness. Or we may apply it to the kingdom of grace_ the gospel-kingdom. ,20250223
1. They are the words of one that was a convert_ a penitent_ that could speak by dear-bought experience of the vanity of the world and the folly of expecting great things from it. He was Coheleth_ one gathered in from his wanderings and gathered home to that God from whom he had revolted. Vanity of vanities_ saith the penitent. All true penitents are convinced of the vanity of the world_ for they find it can do nothing to ease them of the burden of sin_ which they complain of.,20250223
1. They disseize their neighbours of their real estates_ which came to them by descent from their ancestors. They remove the land-marks_ under pretence that they were misplaced (v. and so they encroach upon their neighbours' rights and think they effectually secure that to their posterity which they have got wrongfully_ by making that to be an evidence for them which should have been an evidence for the rightful owner. This was forbidden by the law of Moses (Deut. xix. under a curse_ Deut. xxvii.,20250223
1. They do not enquire after God_ nor seek to acquaint themselves with him_ under their affliction,20250223
1. They falsely accused him_ and that was unjust: You are forgers of lies. They framed a wrong hypothesis concerning the divine Providence_ and misrepresented it_ as if it did never remarkably afflict any but wicked men in this world_ and thence they drew a false judgment concerning Job_ that he was certainly a hypocrite. For this gross mistake_ both in doctrine and application_ he thinks an indictment of forgery lies against them. To speak lies is bad enough_ though but at second hand_ but to forge them with contrivance and deliberation is much worse; yet against this wrong neither innocency nor excellency will be a fence,20250223
1. They hate parasites and those that flatter them_ and are very willing that all about them should deal faithfully with them and tell them that which is true_ whether it be pleasing or displeasing_ both concerning persons and things_ that every thing should be set in a true light and nothing disguised_ ch. xxix. 12,20250223
1. They made ballads on him_ with which they made themselves and their companions merry,20250223
1. They may prosper in their children_ but ruin attends them. His children perhaps are multiplied,20250223
1. They shall be happy in the love of Christ; for he it is that says_ I love those that love me_ v.,20250223
1. This knowledge is hidden from us. It is high_ we cannot attain unto it (v. 21_ 22): It is hid from the eyes of all living_ even of philosophers_ politicians_ and saints; it is kept close from the fowls of the air; though they fly high and in the open firmament of heaven_ though they seem somewhat nearer that upper world where the source of this wisdom is_ though their eyes behold afar off (ch. xxxix. yet they cannot penetrate into the counsels of God. No_ man is wiser than the fowls of heaven_ and yet comes short of this wisdom. Even those who_ in their speculations_ soar highest_ and think themselves_ like the fowls of the air_ above the heads of other people_ yet cannot pretend to this knowledge. Job and his friends had been arguing about the methods and reasons of the dispensations of Providence in the government of the world. __What fools are we__ (says Job) __to fight in the dark thus_ to dispute about that which we do not understand!__ The line and plummet of human reason can never fathom the abyss of the divine counsels. Who can undertake to give the rationale of Providence_ or account for the maxims_ measure_ and methods of God's government_ those arcana imperii—cabinet counsels of divine wisdom? Let us then be content not to know the future events of the Providence until time discover them (Acts i. 7) and not to know the secret reasons of Providence until eternity discover them. God is now a God that hideth himself (Isa. xlv. 15); clouds and darkness are round about him. Though this wisdom be hidden from all living_ yet destruction and death say_ We have heard the fame of it. Though they cannot give an account of themselves (for there is no wisdom_ nor device_ nor knowledge at all in the grave_ much less this)_ yet there is a world on the other side death and the grave_ on which those dark regions border_ and to which we must pass through them_ and there we shall see clearly what we are now in the dark about. __Have a little patience___ says Death to the inquisitive soul: __I will fetch thee shortly to a place where even this wisdom will be found.__ When the mystery of God shall be finished it will be laid open_ and we shall know as we are known; when the veil of flesh is rent_ and the interposing clouds are scattered_ we shall know what God does_ though we know not now_ John,20250223
1. This noble poem presents to us_ in very clear and lively characters_ these five things among others:—,20250223
1. Those that aim at great things fill their hands with business more than they can grasp_ so that their life is both a perfect drudgery and a perpetual hurry; but be not thou such a fool; labour not to be rich. What thou hast_ or doest_ be master of it_ and not a slave to it as those that rise up early_ sit up late_ and eat the bread of carefulness_ and all to be rich. Moderate labour_ that we may have to give_ is our wisdom and duty_ Eph. iv,20250223
1. Three things we are here assured of:— ,20250223
1. Through rashness and inconsideration: Seest thou a man that is hasty in his matters_ that is of a light desultory wit_ that seems to take a thing quickly_ but takes it by the halves_ gallops over a book or science_ but takes no time to digest it_ no time to pause or muse upon a business? There is more hope of making a scholar and a wise man of one that is dull and heavy_ and slow in his studies_ than of one that has such a mercurial genius and cannot fix,20250223
1. To have them always in view: __My son_ let them not depart from thy eyes; let not thy eyes ever depart from them to wander after vanity. Have them always in mind_ and do not forget them; be ever and anon thinking of them_ and conversing with them_ and never imagine that thou hast looked upon them long enough and that it is time now to lay them by; but_ as long as thou livest_ keep up and cultivate thy acquaintance with them.__ He who learns to write must always have his eye upon his copy_ and not let that be out of his sight; and to the words of wisdom must those_ in like manner_ have a constant respect_ who will walk circumspectly,20250223
1. We are here taught not to invade another man's right_ though we can find ways of doing it ever so secretly and plausibly_ clandestinely and by fraud_ without any open force. Let not property in general be entrenched upon_ by robbing men of their liberties and privileges_ or of any just ways of maintaining them. Let not the property of particular persons be encroached upon. The land-marks_ or meer-stones_ are standing witnesses to every man's right; let not those be removed quite away_ for thence come wars_ and fightings_ and endless disputes; let them not be removed so as to take from thy neighbour's lot to thy own_ for that is downright robbing him and entailing the fraud upon posterity,20250223
1. We know not what troubles are before us_ which will take us off our business_ and take us out of the world_ what time and chance will happen to us_ nor what one day_ or a night_ may bring forth. It is not for us to know the times_ no_ not our own time_ when or how we shall die. God has_ in wisdom_ kept us in the dark_ that we may be always ready,20250223
1. We may from them learn that the tabernacles of robbers prosper (so some); for_ ,20250223
1. We must address ourselves to them with all possible seriousness and care: __Keep thy foot_ not keep it back from the house of God (as Prov. xxv. nor go slowly thither_ as one unwilling to draw nigh to God_ but look well to thy goings_ ponder the path of thy feet_ lest thou take a false step. Address thyself to the worship of God with a solemn pause_ and take time to compose thyself for it_ not going about it with precipitation_ which is called hasting with the feet_ Prov. xix,20250223
1. We must be clothed with humility; for the proud in spirit are those that cannot bear to be trampled upon_ but grow outrageous_ and fret themselves_ when they are hardly bestead. That will break a proud man's heart_ which will not break a humble man's sleep. Mortify pride_ therefore_ and a lowly spirit will easily be reconciled to a low condition.,20250223
1. We must be diligent hearers of the word; for how can we believe in him of whom we have not heart? __Hearken unto me_ O you children!__ v,20250223
1. We must begin with those things that are most plain and easy_ as_ blessed be God_ those things are which are most necessary to salvation and of the greatest use. We must lay our foundation firm_ in a sound experimental knowledge of the principles of religion_ and then the super-structure will be well reared and will stand firmly. It is not safe to launch out into the deep at first_ nor to venture into points difficult and controverted until we have first thoroughly digested the elementsof the oracles of God and turned them in succum et sanguinem—into juice and blood. Those that begin their Bible at the wrong end commonly use their knowledge of it in the wrong way. And_ in training up others_ we must be sure to ground them well at first in those truths of God which are plain_ and in some measure level to their capacity_ which we find they comprehend_ and relish_ and know how to make use of_ and not amuse those that are weak with things above them_ things of doubtful disputation_ which they cannot apprehend any certainty of nor advantage by. Our Lord Jesus spoke the word to the people as they were able to hear it (Mark iv. 33) and had many things to say to his disciples which he did not say because as yet they could not bear them_ John xvi. 12_,20250223
1. We must bridle and suppress our own passion_ and take shame to ourselves_ whenever we are justly charged with a fault_ and not insist upon our own innocency: If we have lifted up ourselves_ either in a proud conceit of ourselves or a peevish opposition to those that are over us_ if we have transgressed the laws of our place and station_ we have therein done foolishly. Those that magnify themselves over others or against others_ that are haughty and insolent_ do but shame themselves and betray their own weakness. Nay_ if we have but thought evil_ if we are conscious to ourselves that we have harboured an ill design in our minds_ or it has been suggested to us_ we must lay our hand upon our mouth_ that is_ ,20250223
1. We must closely attend to the word of God_ for that is the word of wisdom_ which is able to make us wise unto salvation_ v. 1_ 2. ,20250223
1. We must get it. He is the happy man who_ having found it_ makes it his own_ gets both an interest in it and the possession of it_ who draws out understanding (so the word it)_ that is_ ,20250223
1. We must keep it as our life: Keep my commandments and live (v. not only_ __Keep them_ and you shall live;__ but_ __Keep them as you would your life_ as those that cannot live without them.__ It would be death to a good man to be deprived of the word of God_ for by it he lives_ and not by bread alone,20250223
1. We must look upon the word of God both as a light (v. 23) and as a law_ v. 20_ 23. ,20250223
1. We must take heed that we never vow anything that is sinful_ or that may be an occasion of sin_ for such a vow is ill-made and must be broken. Suffer not thy mouth_ by such a vow_ to cause thy flesh to sin_ as Herod's rash promise caused him to cut off the head of John the Baptist,20250223
1. We must_ ,20250223
1. We see the decays of the earth itself. ,20250223
1. We shall have the comfort of it in our own bosoms: The liberal soul_ the soul of blessing_ that prays for the afflicted and provides for them_ that scatters blessings with gracious lips and generous hands_ that soul shall be made fat with true pleasure and enriched with more grace,20250223
1. What aggravated this grievance to him. Two things:—,20250223
1. What he aims at in this account of man's estate. ,20250223
1. What his protestation is. In general_ he had been honest and just in all his dealings_ and never_ to his knowledge_ did any body any wrong. ,20250223
1. What his protestation is—that the estate he had he both got and used honestly_ so that his land could not cry out against him nor the furrows thereof complain (v. as they do against those who get the possession of them by fraud and extortion_ Hab. ii. 9-11. The whole creation is said to groan under the sin of man; but that which is unjustly gained and held cries out against a man_ and accuses him_ condemns him_ and demands justice against him for the injury. Rather than his oppression shall go unpunished the very ground and the furrows of it shall witness against him_ and be his prosecutors. Two things he could say safely concerning his estate:—,20250223
1. What is it that Job here asserts? Two things:—,20250223
1. What must be our care when we are in affliction. We must neither despise it nor be weary of it. His exhortation_ before_ was to those that are rich and in prosperity_ here to those that are poor and in adversity. ,20250223
1. What that good is which is here recommended to us; and which is the utmost pleasure and profit we can expect or extract from the business and profit of this world_ and the furthest we can go to rescue it from its vanity and the vexation that is in it. ,20250223
1. What the resolutions were which_ in this matter_ he kept to (v. 1): I made a covenant with my eyes_ that is_ __I watched against the occasions of the sin; why then should I think upon a maid?__ that is_ __by that means_ through the grace of God_ I kept myself from the very first step towards it.__ So far was he from wanton dalliances_ or any act of lasciviousness_ that_ ,20250223
1. What their work must be_ not only to tell in general what preparation is made for souls_ and to give a general offer of it_ but they must address themselves to particular persons_ must tell them of their faults_ reprove_ rebuke_ v. 7_ 8. They must instruct them how to amend—teach_ v,20250223
1. When bad men are preferred_ that which is good is clouded and run down. When power is put into the hands of the wicked_ men hide themselves; wise men retire into privacy_ and decline public business_ not caring to be employed under them; rich men get out of the way_ for fear of being squeezed for what they have; and_ which is worst of all_ good men abscond_ despairing to do good and fearing to be persecuted and ill-treated.,20250223
1. When they were brought by wicked men_ who did not_ according to the true intent and meaning of sacrificing_ repent of their sins_ mortify their lusts_ and amend their lives. Cain brought his offering. Even wicked men may be found in the external performances of religious worship. Many can freely give God their beasts_ their lips_ their knees_ who would not give him their hearts; the Pharisees gave alms. But when the person is an abomination_ as every wicked man is to God_ the performance cannot but be so; even when he brings it diligently; so some read the latter part of the verse. Though their offerings are continually before God (Ps. l. yet they are an abomination to him,20250223
1. When we consider how much this iniquity abounds_ how heinous it is in its own nature_ of what pernicious consequence it is_ and how certainly destructive to all the seeds of the spiritual life in the soul_ we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated and so largely inculcated. ,20250223
1. When_ on the first day of the creation_ in the very beginning of time_ God said_ Let there be light_ and with a word produced it_ this eternal Wisdom was that almighty Word: Then I was there_ when he prepared the heavens_ the fountain of that light_ which_ whatever it is here_ is there substantial,20250223
1. Who they are that belong to that generation_ not only those that curse their parents in heat and passion_ but_ ,20250223
1. With what modesty he speaks of himself and his own attempt. He will not undertake the management of the cause alone_ but very humbly joins his friends with him: __We will commune with thee.__ Those that plead God's cause must be glad of help_ lest it suffer through their weakness. He will not promise much_ but begs leave to assay or attempt_ and try if he could propose any thing that might be pertinent_ and suit Job's case. In difficult matters it becomes us to pretend no further_ but only to try what may be said or done. Many excellent discourses have gone under the modest title of Essays,20250223
10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.,20250223
10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.,20250223
10 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.,20250223
10 Accuse not a servant unto his master_ lest he curse thee_ and thou be found guilty. 11 There is a generation that curseth their father_ and doth not bless their mother. 12 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes_ and yet is not washed from their filthiness. 13 There is a generation_ O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. 14 There is a generation_ whose teeth are as swords_ and their jaw teeth as knives_ to devour the poor from off the earth_ and the needy from among men.,20250223
10 And the Lord turned the captivity of Job_ when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. 11 Then came there unto him all his brethren_ and all his sisters_ and all they that had been of his acquaintance before_ and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him_ and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money_ and every one an earring of gold. 12 So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep_ and six thousand camels_ and a thousand yoke of oxen_ and a thousand she asses. 13 He had also seven sons and three daughters. 14 And he called the name of the first_ Jemima; and the name of the second_ Kezia; and the name of the third_ Keren-happuch. 15 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. 16 After this lived Job a hundred and forty years_ and saw his sons_ and his sons' sons_ even four generations. 17 So Job died_ being old and full of days.,20250223
10 But as for you all_ do ye return_ and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you. 11 My days are past_ my purposes are broken off_ even the thoughts of my heart. 12 They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness. 13 If I wait_ the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness. 14 I have said to corruption_ Thou art my father: to the worm_ Thou art my mother_ and my sister. 15 And where is now my hope? as for my hope_ who shall see it? 16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit_ when our rest together is in the dust.,20250223
10 Cast out the scorner_ and contention shall go out; yea_ strife and reproach shall cease.,20250223
10 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.,20250223
10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.,20250223
10 Divers weights_ and divers measures_ both of them are alike abomination to the Lord.,20250223
10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.,20250223
10 His children shall seek to please the poor_ and his hands shall restore their goods. 11 His bones are full of the sin of his youth_ which shall lie down with him in the dust. 12 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth_ though he hide it under his tongue,20250223
10 I am my beloved's_ and his desire is toward me. 11 Come_ my beloved_ let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. 12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish_ whether the tender grape appear_ and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves. 13 The mandrakes give a smell_ and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits_ new and old_ which I have laid up for thee_ O my beloved.,20250223
10 If thou faint in the day of adversity_ thy strength is small.,20250223
10 My son_ if sinners entice thee_ consent thou not. 11 If they say_ Come with us_ let us lay wait for blood_ let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: 12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole_ as those that go down into the pit: 13 We shall find all precious substance_ we shall fill our houses with spoil: 14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: 15 My son_ walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: 16 For their feet run to evil_ and make haste to shed blood. 17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. 18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. 19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.,20250223
10 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom.,20250223
10 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: 11 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.,20250223
10 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.,20250223
10 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool_ and rewardeth transgressors.,20250223
10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.,20250223
10 The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it_ and is safe.,20250223
10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.,20250223
10 Therefore hearken unto me_ ye men of understanding: far be it from God_ that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty_ that he should commit iniquity. 11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him_ and cause every man to find according to his ways. 12 Yea_ surely God will not do wickedly_ neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. 13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? 14 If he set his heart upon man_ if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath,20250223
10 When it goeth well with the righteous_ the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish_ there is shouting. 11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.,20250223
10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart_ and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul,20250223
10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. 11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her_ so that he shall have no need of spoil. 12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. 13 She seeketh wool_ and flax_ and worketh willingly with her hands. 14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 15 She riseth also while it is yet night_ and giveth meat to her household_ and a portion to her maidens. 16 She considereth a field_ and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 17 She girdeth her loins with strength_ and strengtheneth her arms.,20250223
10 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way_ he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.,20250223
10)_ and now he mentions it again; for_ though it be a truth that needs not be proved_ yet it needs to be much considered_ that it may be duly improved.,20250223
10): Far be it from God that he should do wickedness_ and from us that we should entertain the least suspicion of it or say any thing that looks like charging him with it.,20250223
10): His children shall seek to please the poor_ while his own hands shall restore them their goods with shame (v. 18): That which he laboured for_ by all the arts of oppression_ shall he restore_ and shall not so swallow it down as to digest it; it shall not stay with him_ but according to his shame shall the restitution be; having gotten a great deal unjustly_ he shall restore a great deal_ so that when every one has his own he will have but little left for himself. To be made to restore what was unjustly gotten_ by the sanctifying grace of God_ as Zaccheus was_ is a great mercy; he voluntarily and cheerfully restored four-fold_ and yet had a great deal left to give to the poor_ Luke xix,20250223
10); but then_ on the other hand_ there is a time when God calls to cheerfulness_ a time to laugh and dance_ and then he expects we should serve him with joyfulness and gladness of heart. Observe_ The time of mourning and weeping is put first_ before that of laughter and dancing_ for we must first sow in tears and then reap in joy,20250223
10.,20250223
10. He is able to serve_ but not willing; and God here challenges Job to force him to it. Job expected every thing should be just as he would have it. __Since thou dost pretend__ (says God) __to bring every thing beneath thy sway_ begin with the unicorn_ and try thy skill upon him. Now that thy oxen and asses are all gone_ try whether he will be willing to serve thee in their stead (v. 9) and whether he will be content with the provision thou usedst to make for them: Will he abide by thy crib? No;__,20250223

10. Some think that these were inferior magistrates under him_ and that the respect they paid him was due to his place_ as their sovereign and supreme. It should rather seem that they were his equals in place_ and joined in commission with him_ and that the peculiar honour they gave him was gained by his extraordinary abilities and services. It was agreed that he excelled them all in quickness of apprehension_ soundness of judgment_ closeness of application_ clearness and copiousness of expression; and therefore he was among his fellows an oracle of law_ and counsel_ and justice_ and what he said all attended to and acquiesced in. When he came into court_ especially when he stood up to speak to any business_ the princes refrained talking_ the nobles held their peace_ that they might the more diligently hearken to what he said and might be sure to understand his meaning. Those that had been forward to speak their own thoughts_ loved to hear themselves talk_ and cared not much what any body else said_ yet_ when it came to Job's turn to speak_ were as desirous to know his thoughts as ever they had been to vent their own. Those that suspected their own judgment were satisfied in his_ and admired with what dexterity he split the hair and untied the knots which puzzled them and which they knew not what to make of. When the princes and nobles wrangled among themselves all agreed to refer the matters in dispute to Job and to abide by his judgment. Happy the men that are blessed with such eminent gifts as these; they have great opportunities of honouring God and doing good_ but have great need to watch against pride. Happy the people that are blessed with such eminent men; it is a token for good to them.,20250223

11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness_ and not cut down_ it withereth before any other herb. 13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: 14 Whose hope shall be cut off_ and whose trust shall be a spider's web. 15 He shall lean upon his house_ but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast_ but it shall not endure. 16 He is green before the sun_ and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. 17 His roots are wrapped about the heap_ and seeth the place of stones. 18 If he destroy him from his place_ then it shall deny him_ saying_ I have not seen thee. 19 Behold_ this is the joy of his way_ and out of the earth shall others grow.,20250223
11 Even a child is known by his doings_ whether his work be pure_ and whether it be right.,20250223
11 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart_ so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. 12 I know that there is no good in them_ but for a man to rejoice_ and to do good in his life. 13 And also that every man should eat and drink_ and enjoy the good of all his labour_ it is the gift of God. 14 I know that_ whatsoever God doeth_ it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it_ nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it_ that men should fear before him. 15 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.,20250223
11 He that loveth pureness of heart_ for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend.,20250223

11 Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?,20250223
11 I returned_ and saw under the sun_ that the race is not to the swift_ nor the battle to the strong_ neither yet bread to the wise_ nor yet riches to men of understanding_ nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. 12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net_ and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time_ when it falleth suddenly upon them.,20250223
11 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley_ and to see whether the vine flourished_ and the pomegranates budded. 12 Or ever I was aware_ my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib. 13 Return_ return_ O Shulamite; return_ return_ that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.,20250223
11 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. 12 Behold_ all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain? 13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God_ and the heritage of oppressors_ which they shall receive of the Almighty. 14 If his children be multiplied_ it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. 16 Though he heap up silver as the dust_ and prepare raiment as the clay,20250223
11 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death_ and those that are ready to be slain,20250223
11 My son_ be wise_ and make my heart glad_ that I may answer him that reproacheth me.,20250223
11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him_ they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite_ and Bildad the Shuhite_ and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. 12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off_ and knew him not_ they lifted up their voice_ and wept; and they rent every one his mantle_ and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights_ and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.,20250223
11 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity_ what is man the better? 12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life_ all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?,20250223
11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side_ and shall drive him to his feet. 12 His strength shall be hungerbitten_ and destruction shall be ready at his side. 13 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. 14 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle_ and it shall bring him to the king of terrors. 15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle_ because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 16 His roots shall be dried up beneath_ and above shall his branch be cut off. 17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth_ and he shall have no name in the street. 18 He shall be driven from light into darkness_ and chased out of the world. 19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people_ nor any remaining in his dwellings. 20 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day_ as they that went before were affrighted.,20250223
11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.,20250223
11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.,20250223

11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city_ and as an high wall in his own conceit.,20250223
11 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh_ and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. 12 Thou hast granted me life and favour_ and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. 13 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.,20250223

11 Who hath prevented me_ that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. 12 I will not conceal his parts_ nor his power_ nor his comely proportion. 13 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? 14 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. 15 His scales are his pride_ shut up together as with a close seal. 16 One is so near to another_ that no air can come between them. 17 They are joined one to another_ they stick together_ that they cannot be sundered. 18 By his neesings a light doth shine_ and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps_ and sparks of fire leap out. 20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke_ as out of a seething pot or caldron. 21 His breath kindleth coals_ and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 22 In his neck remaineth strength_ and sorrow is turned into joy before him. 23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. 24 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea_ as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. 25 When he raiseth up himself_ the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. 26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear_ the dart_ nor the habergeon. 27 He esteemeth iron as straw_ and brass as rotten wood. 28 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 30 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. 31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 32 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. 33 Upon earth there is not his like_ who is made without fear. 34 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.,20250223
11 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? 12 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? 13 For now should I have lain still and been quiet_ I should have slept: then had I been at rest_ 14 With kings and counsellors of the earth_ which built desolate places for themselves,20250223
11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun. 12 For wisdom is a defence_ and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is_ that wisdom giveth life to them that have it. 13 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight_ which he hath made crooked? 14 In the day of prosperity be joyful_ but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other_ to the end that man should find nothing after him. 15 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness_ and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness. 16 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? 17 Be not over much wicked_ neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? 18 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea_ also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. 19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. 20 For there is not a just man upon earth_ that doeth good_ and sinneth not. 21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: 22 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.,20250223
11)_ Eliphaz_ Bildad_ and Zophar. We shall afterwards meet with a fourth_ who it should seem was present at the whole conference_ namely_ Elihu. Whether he came as a friend of Job or only as an auditor does not appear. These three are said to be his friends_ his intimate acquaintance_ as David and Solomon had each of them one in their court that was called the king's friend. These three were eminently wise and good men_ as appears by their discourses. They were old men_ very old_ had a great reputation for knowledge_ and much deference was paid to their judgment_ ch. xxxii,20250223

11. This may be considered as an act of God's power over the sea. Though it is so vast a body_ and though its motion is sometimes extremely violent_ yet God has it under check. Its waves rise no higher_ its tides roll no further_ than God permits; and this is mentioned as a reason why we should stand in awe of God (Jer. v. and yet why we should encourage ourselves in him_ for he that stops the noise of the sea_ even the noise of her waves_ can_ when he pleases_ still the tumult of the people_ Ps. lxv,20250223
12 A naughty person_ a wicked man_ walketh with a froward mouth. 13 He winketh with his eyes_ he speaketh with his feet_ he teacheth with his fingers,20250223

12 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.,20250223
12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom_ and madness_ and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done. 13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly_ as far as light excelleth darkness. 14 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. 15 Then said I in my heart_ As it happeneth to the fool_ so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart_ that this also is vanity. 16 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.,20250223
12 Apply thine heart unto instruction_ and thine ears to the words of knowledge. 13 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod_ he shall not die. 14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod_ and shalt deliver his soul from hell. 15 My son_ if thine heart be wise_ my heart shall rejoice_ even mine. 16 Yea_ my reins shall rejoice_ when thy lips speak right things.,20250223

12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. 14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and_ behold_ all is vanity and vexation of spirit. 15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. 16 I communed with mine own heart_ saying_ Lo_ I am come to great estate_ and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea_ my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom_ and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 18 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.,20250223
12 I wisdom dwell with prudence_ and find out knowledge of witty inventions. 13 The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride_ and arrogancy_ and the evil way_ and the froward mouth_ do I hate. 14 Counsel is mine_ and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. 15 By me kings reign_ and princes decree justice. 16 By me princes rule_ and nobles_ even all the judges of the earth. 17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. 18 Riches and honour are with me; yea_ durable riches and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold_ yea_ than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. 20 I lead in the way of righteousness_ in the midst of the paths of judgment: 21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.,20250223

12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man_ rather than a fool in his folly.,20250223
12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me_ and mine ear received a little thereof. 13 In thoughts from the visions of the night_ when deep sleep falleth on men_ 14 Fear came upon me_ and trembling_ which made all my bones to shake. 15 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: 16 It stood still_ but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes_ there was silence_ and I heard a voice_ saying_ 17 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? 18 Behold_ he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly: 19 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay_ whose foundation is in the dust_ which are crushed before the moth? 20 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it. 21 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die_ even without wisdom.,20250223

12 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.,20250223
12 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.,20250223
12 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. 13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. 14 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him_ who can tell him? 15 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them_ because he knoweth not how to go to the city.,20250223
12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man_ but the end thereof are the ways of death.,20250223

13 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple_ and knoweth nothing. 14 For she sitteth at the door of her house_ on a seat in the high places of the city_ 15 To call passengers who go right on their ways: 16 Whoso is simple_ let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding_ she saith to him_ 17 Stolen waters are sweet_ and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. 18 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.,20250223

Reverence of the place and company_ and of the work that was doing_ could not restrain him_ but he was almost as wicked and vile there as any where. No sin will appear more frightful to an awakened conscience than the profanation of holy things; nor will any aggravation of sin render it more exceedingly sinful than the place we are honoured with in the congregation and assembly_ and the advantages we enjoy thereby. Zimri and Cozbi avowed their villany in the sight of Moses and all the congregation (Num. and heart-adultery is as open to God_ and must needs be most offensive to him_ when we draw nigh to him in religious exercises. I was in all evil in defiance of the magistrates and judges_ and their assemblies; so some understand it. Others refer it to the evil of punishment_ not to the evil of sin: __I was made an example_ a spectacle to the world. I was under almost all God's sore judgments in the midst of the congregation of Israel_ set up for a mark. I stood up and cried in the congregation___ Job xxx,20250223

15 Behold now behemoth_ which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. 16 Lo now_ his strength is in his loins_ and his force is in the navel of his belly. 17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. 18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. 19 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. 20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food_ where all the beasts of the field play. 21 He lieth under the shady trees_ in the covert of the reed_ and fens. 22 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. 23 Behold_ he drinketh up a river_ and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 24 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.,20250223

15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern_ and running waters out of thine own well. 16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad_ and rivers of waters in the streets. 17 Let them be only thine own_ and not strangers' with thee. 18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 20 And why wilt thou_ my son_ be ravished with a strange woman_ and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord_ and he pondereth all his goings. 22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself_ and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins. 23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.,20250223

15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? 16 Which were cut down out of time_ whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 17 Which said unto God_ Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? 18 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 19 The righteous see it_ and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. 20 Whereas our substance is not cut down_ but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.,20250223
15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction_ and openeth their ears in oppression. 16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place_ where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. 17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee. 18 Because there is wrath_ beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 19 Will he esteem thy riches? no_ not gold_ nor all the forces of strength. 20 Desire not the night_ when people are cut off in their place. 21 Take heed_ regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 22 Behold_ God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 23 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say_ Thou hast wrought iniquity?,20250223

16 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment_ that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness_ that iniquity was there. 17 I said in mine heart_ God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. 18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men_ that God might manifest them_ and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. 19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth_ so dieth the other; yea_ they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. 20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust_ and all turn to dust again. 21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward_ and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? 22 Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better_ than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?,20250223
16 Because thou shalt forget thy misery_ and remember it as waters that pass away: 17 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth_ thou shalt be as the morning. 18 And thou shalt be secure_ because there is hope; yea_ thou shalt dig about thee_ and thou shalt take thy rest in safety. 19 Also thou shalt lie down_ and none shall make thee afraid; yea_ many shall make suit unto thee. 20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail_ and they shall not escape_ and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.,20250223

This is also vanity. 20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun. 21 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom_ and in knowledge_ and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. 22 For what hath man of all his labour_ and of the vexation of his heart_ wherein he hath laboured under the sun? 23 For all his days are sorrows_ and his travail grief; yea_ his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. 24 There is nothing better for a man_ than that he should eat and drink_ and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw_ that it was from the hand of God. 25 For who can eat_ or who else can hasten hereunto_ more than I? 26 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom_ and knowledge_ and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail_ to gather and to heap up_ that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.,20250223

He was sick of his pleasures_ and_ as nauseating them_ he turned from them_ that he might again apply himself to speculation; and if_ upon this rehearing of the cause_ the verdict be still the same_ the judgment will surely be decisive; for what can the man do that comes after the king? especially such a king_ who had so much of this world to make the experiment upon and so much wisdom to make it with. The baffled trial needs not be repeated. No man can expect to find more satisfaction in the world than Solomon did_ nor to gain a greater insight into the principles of morality; when a man has done what he can still it is that which has been already done.

18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. 19 She layeth her hands to the spindle_ and her hands hold the distaff. 20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea_ she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. 22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. 23 Her husband is known in the gates_ when he sitteth among the elders of the land. 24 She maketh fine linen_ and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. 25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. 26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. 27 She looketh well to the ways of her household_ and eateth not the bread of idleness. 28 Her children arise up_ and call her blessed; her husband also_ and he praiseth her. 29 Many daughters have done virtuously_ but thou excellest them all. 30 Favour is deceitful_ and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord_ she shall be praised. 31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.,20250223

18)_ He is swift upon the waters. Privateers choose those ships that are the best sailors. In these swift ships they cruise from one channel to another_ to pick up prizes; and this brings them in so much wealth that their portion is cursed in the earth_ and they behold not the way of the vineyards_ that is (as bishop Patrick explains it)_ they despise the employment of those who till the ground and plant vineyards as poor and unprofitable. But others make this a further description of the conduct of those sinners that are afraid of the light: if they be discovered_ they get away as fast as they can_ and choose to lurk_ not in the vineyards_ for fear of being discovered_ but in some cursed portion_ a lonely and desolate place_ which nobody looks after,20250223

Thou hast maintained the cause of the wicked; and such as a man's cause is such will the judgment of God be upon him;__ so bishop Patrick.

The breath of this creature is so hot and fiery_ from the great natural heat within_ that burning lamps and sparks of fire_ smoke and a flame_ are said to go out of his mouth_ even such as one would think sufficient to set coals on fire_ v. 19-21. Probably these hyperbolical expressions are used concerning the leviathan to intimate the terror of the wrath of God_ for that is it which all this is designed to convince us of.

His necessary expenses make him sick_ make him fret_ and he seems as if he were angry that himself and those about him cannot live without meat. As we read the last clause_ it intimates how ill this covetous worldling can bear the common and unavoidable calamities of human life.

He has not any sorrow after a godly sort_ does not sorrow to repentance_ but he has sorrow and wrath_ is angry at the providence of God_ angry at his sickness_ angry at all about him_ fretful and peevish_ which doubles his affliction_ which a good man lessens and lightens by patience and joy in his sickness.,20250223

Note_ A gracious heart is jealous for the honour of God_ and cannot but be angry when that is neglected or postponed_ or when any injury is done it. Nor is it any breach of the law of meekness to be angry at our friends when they are offensive to God. Get thee behind me_ Satan_ says Christ to Simon. Elihu owned Job to be a good man_ and yet would not say as he said when he thought he said amiss: it is too great a compliment to our friends not to tell them of their faults. ,20250223

2. A man laid down in the grave will not rise up again_ v. 11_ 12. Every night we lie down to sleep_ and in the morning we awake and rise again; but at death we must lie down in the grave_ not to awake or rise again to such a world_ such a state_ as we are now in_ never to awake or arise until the heavens_ the faithful measures of time_ shall be no more_ and consequently time itself shall come to an end and be swallowed up in eternity; so that the life of man may fitly be compared to the waters of a land-flood_ which spread far and make a great show_ but they are shallow_ and when they are cut off from the sea or river_ the swelling and overflowing of which was the cause of them_ they soon decay and dry up_ and their place knows them no more. The waters of life are soon exhaled and disappear. The body_ like some of those waters_ sinks and soaks into the earth_ and is buried there; the soul_ like others of them_ is drawn upwards_ to mingle with the waters above the firmament. The learned Sir Richard Blackmore makes this also to be a dissimilitude. If the waters decay and be dried up in the summer_ yet they will return again in the winter; but it is not so with the life of man. Take part of his paraphrase in his own words:—,20250223
2. A moral prognostication of the preferment of such a man; though now he stands before mean men_ is employed by them and attends upon them_ yet he will rise_ and is likely enough to stand before kings_ as an ambassador to foreign kings or prime-minister of state to his own. Seest thou a man diligent in the business of religion? He is likely to excel in virtue_ and shall stand before the King of kings.,20250223
2. A powerful check given to these vanities and pleasures: __Know thou that for all these things God shall bring thee into judgment_ and duly consider that_ and then live such a luxurious life if thou canst_ if thou darest.__ This is a kolasterion—a corrective to the foregoing concession_ and plucks in the reins he had laid on the neck of the young man's lust. __Know then_ for a certainty_ that_ if thou dost take such a liberty as this_ it will be thy everlasting ruin; thou hast to do with a God who will not let it go unpunished.__ Note_ ,20250223
2. A promise_ which makes it our interest to serve God with our estates. It is the way to make a little much_ and much more; it is the surest and safest method of thriving: So shall thy barns be filled with plenty. He does not say thy bags_ but thy barns_ not thy wardrobe replenished_ but thy presses: __God shall bless thee with an increase of that which is for use_ not for show or ornament—for spending and laying out_ not for hoarding and laying up.__ Those that do good with what they have shall have more to do more good with. Note_ If we make our worldly estates serviceable to our religion we shall find our religion very serviceable to the prosperity of our worldly affairs. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is and most of the comfort of it. We mistake if we think that giving will undo us and make us poor. No_ giving for God's honour will make us rich_ Hag. ii,20250223

2. As in a pleasant garden. And well may a very great delight be compared to the delight taken in a garden_ when the happiness of Adam in innocency was represented by the putting of him into a garden_ a garden of pleasure. This comparison is pursued_ v. 12-14. The church is fitly compared to a garden_ to a garden which_ as was usual_ had a fountain in it. Where Solomon made himself gardens and orchards he made himself pools of water (Eccl. ii. 5_ not only for curiosity and diversion_ in water-works_ but for use_ to water the gardens. Eden was well watered_ Gen. ii. 10;,20250223
2. As shadows to the upper world (v. 29): Can any understand the spreading of the clouds? They are spread over the earth as a curtain or canopy; how they come to be so_ how stretched out_ and how poised_ as they are_ we cannot understand_ though we daily see they are so. Shall we then pretend to understand the reasons and methods of God's judicial proceedings with the children of men_ whose characters and cases are so various_ when we cannot account for the spreadings of the clouds_ which cover the light? v,20250223
2. As soon as the days of their feasting were over he called them to the solemn exercises of religion. Not while their feasting lasted (let them take their time for that; there is a time for all things)_ but when it was over_ their good father reminded them that they must know when to desist_ and not think to fare sumptuously every day; though they had their days of feasting the week round_ they must not think to have them the year round; they had something else to do. Note_ Those that are merry must find a time to be serious.,20250223
2. As to his general character before this affliction. He charges him with wickedness and false-heartedness_ and this article of his charge was utterly groundless and unjust. How unkindly does he banter him_ and upbraid him with the great profession of religion he had made_ as if it had all now come to nothing and proved a sham (v. 6): __Is not this thy fear_ thy confidence_ thy hope_ and the uprightness of thy ways? Does it not all appear now to be a mere pretence? For_ hadst thou been sincere in it_ God would not thus have afflicted thee_ nor wouldst thou have behaved thus under the affliction.__ This was the very thing Satan aimed at_ to prove Job a hypocrite_ and disprove the character God had given of him. When he could not himself do this to God_ but he still saw and said_ Job is perfect and upright_ then he endeavoured_ by his friends_ to do it to Job himself_ and to persuade him to confess himself a hypocrite. Could he have gained that point he would have triumphed. Habes confitentem reum—Out of thy own mouth will I condemn thee. But_ by the grace of God_ Job was enabled to hold fast his integrity_ and would not bear false witness against himself. Note_ Those that pass rash and uncharitable censures upon their brethren_ and condemn them as hypocrites_ do Satan's work_ and serve his interest_ more than they are aware of. I know not how it comes to pass that this verse is differently read in several editions of our common English Bibles; the original_ and all the ancient versions_ put thy hope before the uprightness of thy ways. So does the Geneva_ and most of the editions of the last translation; but I find one of the first_ in 1612_ has it_ Is not this thy fear_ thy confidence_ the uprightness of thy ways_ and thy hope? Both the Assembly's Annotations and Mr. Pool's have that reading: and an edition in 1660 reads it_ __Is not thy fear thy confidence_ and the uprightness of thy ways thy hope? Does it not appear now that all the religion both of thy devotion and of thy conversation was only in hope and confidence that thou shouldst grow rich by it? Was it not all mercenary?__ The very thing that Satan suggested. Is not thy religion thy hope_ and are not thy ways thy confidence? so Mr. Broughton. Or_ __Was it not? Didst thou not think that that would be thy protection? But thou art deceived.__ Or_ __Would it not have been so? If it had been sincere_ would it not have kept thee from this despair?__ It is true_ if thou faint in the day of adversity_ thy strength_ thy grace_ is small (Prov. xxiv. 10); but it does not therefore follow that thou hast no grace_ no strength at all. A man's character is not to be taken from a single act.,20250223
2. As to the representation here made of the beauty of the church_ the images are certainly very bright_ the shades are strong_ and the comparisons bold_ not proper indeed to represent any external beauty_ for they were not designed to do so_ but the beauty of holiness_ the new man_ the hidden man of the heart_ in that which is not corruptible. Seven particulars are specified_ a number of perfection_ for the church is enriched with manifold graces by the seven spirits that are before the throne_ Rev. i. 4,20250223
2. Because the hypocrite's prayer will not be heard (v. 9): Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him? No_ he will not; it cannot be expected he should. If true repentance come upon him_ God will hear his cry and accept him (Isa. i. 18); but_ if he continue impenitent and unchanged_ let him not think to find favour with God. Observe_ ,20250223

Christ soon determines what to do in this case_ and his spouse agrees with him in it (v. 9): __If she be a wall_ if the good work be once begun with the Gentiles_ with the souls that are to be called in_ if the little sister_ when she shall be spoken for by the gospel_ will but receive the word_ and build herself upon Christ the foundation_ and frame her doings to turn to the Lord_ as the wall is in order to the house_ we will build upon her a palace of silver_ or build her up into such a palace; we will carry on the good work that is begun_ till the wall become a palace_ the wall of stone a palace of silver___ which goes beyond the boast of Augustus Cæsar_ that what he found brick he left marble. This little sister_ when once she is joined to the Lord_ shall be made to grow into a holy temple_ a habitation of God through the Spirit_ Eph. ii. 21_ 22. If she be a door_ when this palace comes to be finished_ and the doors of this wall set up_ which was the last thing done (Neh. vii. 1)_ then we will enclose here with boards of cedar; we will carefully and effectually protect her_ that she shall receive no damage. We will do it; Father_ Son_ and Holy Ghost_ all concur in contriving_ carrying on_ and crowning_ the blessed work when the time comes. Whatever is wanting shall be set in order_ and the work of faith shall be fulfilled with power. Though the beginnings of grace be small_ the latter end shall greatly increase. The church is in care concerning those that are yet uncalled. __Let me alone___ says Christ; __I will do all that which is necessary to be done for them. Trust me with it.__,20250223
2. Civil government is wisdom; it is God's ordinance; magistrates are his vicegerents. God by David had said to the fools_ Deal not foolishly_ Ps. lxxv,20250223
2. Divers arguments Solomon here urges to enforce this caution against the sin of whoredom. ,20250223
2. Elihu spoke because he thought that it was time to speak_ and that now_ at length_ it had come to his turn_ v. 4_ 5. ,20250223
2. Even in his former prosperous state troubles were continually feared; so that then he was never easy_ v. 25_ 26. He knew so much of the vanity of the world_ and the troubles to which_ of course_ he was born_ that he was not in safety_ neither had he rest then. That which made his grief now the more grievous was that he was not conscious to himself of any great degree either of negligence or security in the day of his prosperity_ which might provoke God thus to chastise him.,20250223
2. For the further proof of this (v. 4) he makes it the character_ ,20250223
2. For the righteous to be oppressed_ and run down_ and trampled upon_ by the violence or subtlety of evil men_ to be displaced and thrust into obscurity_ this is the troubling of the fountains of justice and corrupting the very springs of government_ ch. xxviii. 12_ 28; xxix,20250223
2. For young people_ to give them knowledge and discretion. Youth is the learning age_ catches at instructions_ receives impressions_ and retains what is then received; it is therefore of great consequence that the mind be then seasoned well_ nor can it receive a better tincture than from Solomon's proverbs. Youth is rash_ and heady_ and inconsiderate; man is born like the wild ass's colt_ and therefore needs to be broken by the restraints and managed by the rules we find here. And_ if young people will but take heed to their ways according to Solomon's proverbs_ they will soon gain the knowledge and discretion of the ancients. Solomon had an eye to posterity in writing this book_ hoping by it to season the minds of the rising generation with the generous principles of wisdom and virtue.,20250223
2. From all this Job infers the impertinency of their discourses_ v,20250223
2. From all this let us take occasion_ ,20250223
2. From the kingdom of Providence_ that special Providence which is conversant about the affairs of the children of men. Consider what God does in the government of the world_ and you will say_ He is wise in heart and mighty in strength. ,20250223
2. God is a sovereign Lord (v. 10): If he cut off by death (margin_ If he make a change_ for death is a change; if he make a change in nations_ in families_ in the posture of our affairs)_—if he shut up in prison_ or in the net of affliction (Ps. lxvi. 11)_—if he seize any creature as a hunter his prey_ he will gather it (so bishop Patrick) and who shall force him to restore? or if he gather together_ as tares for the fire_ or if he gather to himself man's spirit and breath (ch. xxxiv. then who can hinder him? Who can either arrest the sentence or oppose the execution? Who can control his power or arraign his wisdom and justice? If he that made all out of nothing think fit to reduce all to nothing_ or to their first chaos again_—if he that separated between light and darkness_ dry land and sea_ at first_ please to gather them together again_—if he that made unmakes_ who can turn him away_ alter his mind or stay his hand_ impede or impeach his proceedings?,20250223
2. God is omniscient_ and can discover that which is most secret. As the strongest cannot oppose his arm_ so the most subtle cannot escape his eye; and therefore_ if some are punished either more or less than we think they should be_ instead of quarrelling with God_ it becomes us to ascribe it to some secret cause known to God only. For_ ,20250223
2. Great pains must be taken to compromise matters in variance between relations_ with all speed_ because it is a work of so much difficulty_ and consequently the more honourable if it be done. Esau was a brother offended_ and seemed harder to be won than a strong city_ yet by a work of God upon his heart_ in answer to Jacob's prayer_ he was won.,20250223
2. Having given this particular account of his parts_ and his power_ and his comely proportion_ he concludes with four things in general concerning this animal:— ,20250223
2. He attributes all his present troubles to these supposed sins (v. 10_ 11): __Those that are guilty of such practices as these commonly bring themselves into just such a condition as thou art now in; and therefore we conclude thou hast been thus guilty.__ ,20250223
2. He believes the happiness of the redeemed_ and his own title to that happiness_ that_ at Christ's second coming_ believers shall be raised up in glory and so made perfectly blessed in the vision and fruition of God; and this he believes with application to himself. ,20250223
2. He called her to rise and come away_ v. 10_ and again v,20250223
2. He charged it upon Job that he made a bad use of this doctrine_ which he might have made so good a use of_ v,20250223
2. He charges Job very high upon it. In general_ What man is like Job? v,20250223
2. He charges children both to receive and to retain the good lessons and laws their parents give them. ,20250223
2. He complains of the severity of the execution. God (he thought) did not only punish him for every failure_ but punish him in a high degree_ v. 16_ 17. His affliction was_ ,20250223
2. He composed himself with quieting considerations_ that he might not be disturbed and put out of the possession of his own soul by these events. He reasons from the common state of human life_ which he describes with application to himself: Naked came I (as others do) out of my mother's womb_ and naked shall I return thither_ into the lap of our common mother—the earth_ as the child_ when it is sick or weary_ lays its head in its mother's bosom. Dust we were in our original_ and to dust we return in our exit (Gen. iii. to the earth as we were (Eccl. xii. naked shall we return thither_ whence we were taken_ namely_ to the clay_ ch. xxxiii,20250223
2. He exposes the frivolous excuses he makes for himself_ and shows how ridiculous he makes himself. When he is roused he stretched himself_ and begs_ as for alms_ for more sleep_ more slumber; he is well in his warm bed_ and cannot endure to think of rising_ especially of rising to work. But_ observe_ he promises himself and his master that he will desire but a little more sleep_ a little more slumber_ and then he will get up and go to his business. But herein he deceives himself; the more a slothful temper is indulged the more it prevails; let him sleep awhile_ and slumber awhile_ and still he is in the same tune; still he asks for a little more sleep_ yet a little more; he never thinks he has enough_ and yet_ when he is called_ pretends he will come presently. Thus men's great work is left undone by being put off yet a little longer_ de die in diem—from day to day; and they are cheated of all their time by being cheated of the present moments. A little more sleep proves an everlasting sleep. Sleep on now_ and take your rest.,20250223
2. He feeds on the productions of the earth and does not prey upon other animals: He eats grass as an ox (v. the mountains bring him forth food (v. and the beasts of the field do not tremble before him nor flee from him_ as from a lion_ but they play about him_ knowing they are in no danger from him. This may give us occasion_ ,20250223
2. He found that the more he saw of the works done under the sun the more he saw of their vanity; nay_ and the sight often occasioned him vexation of spirit (v. 14): __I have seen all the works of a world full of business_ have observed what the children of men are doing; and behold_ whatever men think of their own works_ I see all is vanity and vexation of spirit.__ He had before pronounced all vanity (v. needless and unprofitable_ and that which does us no good; here he adds_ It is all vexation of spirit_ troublesome and prejudicial_ and that which does us hurt. It is feeding upon wind; so some read it_ Hos. xii. 1. ,20250223
2. He gives some instances of God's dominion and power.,20250223
2. He had 7000 sheep_ and shepherds that kept them; and all those he lost at the same time by lightning_ v,20250223
2. He had observed them to prosper and flourish in the abuse of their power (v. 10): I saw those wicked rulers come and go from the place of the holy_ go in state to and return in pomp from the place of judicature (which is called the place of the Holy One because the judgment is the Lord's_ Deut. i. 17_ and he judges among the gods_ Ps. lxxxii. 1_ and is with them in the judgment_ 2 Chron. and they continued all their days in office_ were never reckoned with for their mal-administration_ but died in honour and were buried magnificently; their commissions were durante vitâ—during life_ and not quamdiu se bene gesserint—during good behaviour. And they were forgotten in the city where they had so done; their wicked practices were not remembered against them to their reproach and infamy when they were gone. Or_ rather_ it denotes the vanity of their dignity and power_ for that is his remark upon it in the close of the verse: This is also vanity. They are proud of their wealth_ and power_ and honour_ because they sit in the place of the holy; but all this cannot secure_ ,20250223
2. He has blessed the world with a revelation of his will. Out of his mouth_ by the law and the prophets_ by the written word and by his ministers_ both which are his mouth to the children of men_ come knowledge and understanding_ such a discovery of truth and good as_ if we admit and receive the impressions of it_ will make us truly knowing and intelligent. It is both an engagement and encouragement to search after wisdom that we have the scriptures to search_ in which we may find it if we seek it diligently.,20250223
2. He invites them to repent and become wise_ v,20250223
2. He is a dangerous man_ falls foul of every one that stands in his way_ though innocent_ though his friend_ as a bear robbed of her whelps sets upon the first man she meets as the robber. Ira furor brevis est—Anger is temporary madness. One may more easily stop_ escape_ or guard against an enraged bear_ than an outrageous angry man. Let us therefore watch over our own passions (lest they get head and do mischief) and so consult our own honour; and let us avoid the company of furious men_ and get out of their way when they are in their fury_ and so consult our own safety. Currenti cede furori—Give place unto wrath.,20250223
2. He knew so much of himself the he durst not stand a trial_ v. 20_ 21. __If I go about to justify myself_ and to plead a righteousness of my own_ my defence will be my offence_ and my own mouth shall condemn me even when it goes about to acquit me.__ A good man_ who knows the deceitfulness of his own heart_ and is jealous over it with a godly jealousy_ and has often discovered that amiss there which had long lain undiscovered_ is suspicious of more evil in himself than he is really conscious of_ and therefore will by no means think of justifying himself before God. If we say we have no sin_ we not only deceive ourselves_ but we affront God; for we sin in saying so_ and give the lie to the scripture_ which has concluded all under sin. __If I say_ I am perfect_ I am sinless_ God has nothing to lay to my charge_ my very saying so shall prove me perverse_ proud_ ignorant_ and presumptuous. Nay_ though I were perfect_ though God should pronounce me just_ yet would I not know my soul_ I would not be in care about the prolonging of my life while it is loaded with all these miseries.__ Or_ __Though I were free from gross sin_ though my conscience should not charge me with any enormous crime_ yet would I not believe my own heart so far as to insist upon my innocency nor think my life worth striving for with God.__ In short_ it is folly to contend with God_ and our wisdom_ as well as duty_ to submit to him and throw ourselves at his feet.,20250223
2. He ministers justice to all (v. 11): The work of a man shall he render unto him. Good works shall be rewarded and evil works either punished or satisfied for; so that sooner or later_ in this world or in that to come_ he will cause every man to find according to his ways. This is the standing rule of distributive justice_ to give to every man according to his work. Say to the righteous_ it shall be well with them; woe to the wicked_ it shall be ill with them. If services persevered in now go unrewarded_ and sins persisted in now go unpunished_ yet there is a day coming when God will fully render to every man according to his works_ with interest for the delay.,20250223
2. He never thinks he has enough: His eye is not satisfied with riches. Covetousness is called the lust of the eye (1 John ii. 16) because the beholding of it with his eyes is all that the worldling seems to covet_ Eccl. v,20250223
2. He next descends to the particular instances of the wisdom and power of God in the revolutions of states and kingdoms; for thence he fetches his proofs_ rather than from the like operations of Providence concerning private persons and families_ because the more high and public the station is in which men are placed the more the changes that befal them are taken notice of_ and consequently the more illustriously does Providence shine forth in them. And it is easy to argue_ If God can thus turn and toss the great ones of the earth_ like a ball in a large place (as the prophet speaks_ Isa. xxii. much more the little ones; and with him to whom states and kingdoms must submit it is surely the greatest madness for us to contend. Some think that Job here refers to the extirpation of those powerful nations_ the Rephaim_ the Zuzim_ the Emim_ and the Horites (mentioned Gen. xiv. 5_ 6; Deut. ii. 10_ in which perhaps it was particularly noticed how strangely they were infatuated and enfeebled: if so_ it is designed to show that whenever the like is done in the affairs of nations it is God that does it_ and we must therein observe his sovereign dominion_ even over those that think themselves most powerful_ politic_ and absolute. Compare this with that of Eliphaz_ ch. v. 12_ &c. Let us gather up the particular changes here specified_ which God makes upon persons_ either for the destruction of nations and the planting of others in their room or for the turning out of a particular government and ministry and the elevation of another in its room_ which may be a blessing to the kingdom; witness the glorious Revolution in our own land twenty years ago_ in which we saw as happy an exposition as ever was given of this discourse of Job's.,20250223
2. He refers to the testimony of the ancients and to the knowledge which Job himself had of their sentiments. __Do thou enquire of the former age_ and let them tell thee_ not only their own judgment in this matter_ but the judgment also of their fathers_ v,20250223
2. He resolves all these disappointments into an over-ruling power and providence_ the disposals of which to us seem casual_ and we call them chance_ but really they are according to the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God_ here called time_ in the language of this book_ ch. iii. 1; Ps.,20250223
2. He shall be diseased and distempered in his body; and how little comfort a man has in riches if he has not health! Sickness and pain_ especially it they be in extremity_ embitter all his enjoyments. This wicked man has all the delights of sense wound up to the height of pleasurableness; but what real happiness can he enjoy when his bones are full of the sins of his youth (v. that is_ of the effects of those sins? By his drunkenness and gluttony_ his uncleanness and wantonness_ when he was young_ he contracted those diseases which are painful to him long after_ and perhaps make his life very miserable_ and_ as Solomon speaks_ consume his flesh and his body_ Prov. v,20250223
2. He speaks particularly of tyrants and cruel oppressors_ under the similitude of lions_ v. 10_,20250223
2. He thinks it unbecoming the infinite knowledge of God to put his prisoner thus upon the rack_ as it were_ by torture_ to extort a confession from him_ v. 4-6. ,20250223
2. He took to love a garden_ which is to some as bewitching as building. He planted himself vineyards_ which the soil and climate of the land of Canaan favoured; he made himself fine gardens and orchards (v. and perhaps the art of gardening was no way inferior then to what it is now. He had not only forests of timber-trees_ but trees of all kinds of fruit_ which he himself had planted; and_ if any worldly business would yield a man happiness_ surely it must be that which Adam was employed in while he was in innocency.,20250223
2. He valued himself by the care he took of those that were least able to help themselves_ the poor and the needy_ the widows and fatherless_ the blind and the lame_ who could not be supposed either to merit his favour or ever to be in a capacity to recompense it. ,20250223
2. He wants nothing for his soul of all that he desires. Providence has been so liberal to him that he has as much as heart could wish_ and more_ Ps. lxxiii,20250223
2. He was a despised man (v. 6): __He__ (that is_ Eliphaz_ so some_ or rather God_ whom he all along acknowledges to be the author of his calamities) __has made me a byword of the people_ the talk of the country_ a laughing-stock to many_ a gazing-stock to all; and aforetime (or to men's faces_ publicly) I was as a tabret_ that whoever chose might play upon.__ They made ballads of him; his name became a proverb; it is so still_ As poor as Job. __He has now made me a byword___ a reproach of men_ whereas_ aforetime_ in my prosperity_ I was as a tabret_ deliciæ humani generis—the darling of the human race_ whom they were all pleased with. It is common for those who were honoured in their wealth to be despised in their poverty.,20250223
2. He was even struck with admiration at the beauty of his church (v. 6): How fair and how pleasant art thou_ O love! How art thou made fair! (so the word is)_ __not born so_ but made so with the comeliness which I have put upon thee.__ Holiness is a beauty beyond expression; the Lord Jesus is wonderfully pleased with it; the outward aspect of it is fair; the inward disposition of it is pleasant and highly agreeable_ and the complacency he has in it is inexpressible. O my dearest for delights! so some read,20250223
2. He was violently urged to revenge_ and yet he kept himself thus clear from it (v. 31): The men of his tabernacle_ his domestics_ his servants_ and those about him_ were so enraged at Job's enemy who hated him_ that they could have eaten him_ if Job would but have set them on or given them leave. __O that we had of his flesh! Our master is satisfied to forgive him_ but we cannot be so satisfied.__ See how much beloved Job was by his family_ how heartily they espoused his cause_ and what enemies they were to his enemies; but see what a strict hand Job kept upon his passions_ that he would not avenge himself_ though he had those about him that blew the coals of his resentment. Note_ ,20250223
2. He will not be at the pains to feed himself_ an elegant hyperbole; as we say_ A man is so lazy that he would not shake fire off him_ so here_ He cannot find in his heart to take his hand out of his bosom_ no_ not to put meat into his own mouth. If the law be so that those that will not labour must not eat_ he will rather starve than stir. Thus his sin is his punishment_ and therefore is egregious folly.,20250223
2. His irresistible power (v. 14): If he set his heart upon man_ to contend with him_ much more if (as some read it) he set his heart against man_ to ruin him_ if he should deal with man either by summa potestas—mere sovereignty_ or by summum jus—strict justice_ there were no standing before him; man's spirit and breath would soon be gone and all flesh would perish together_ v,20250223
2. His management of himself_ in this distemper_ was very strange_ v. 8.,20250223
2. His nights were restless_ v. 3_ 4. The night relieves the toil and fatigue of the day_ not only to the labourers_ but to the sufferers: if a sick man can but get a little sleep in the night_ it helps nature_ and it is hoped that he will do well_ John xi,20250223
2. How apt sinners are to relapse into it notwithstanding. As the dog_ after he has gained ease by vomiting that which burdened his stomach_ yet goes and licks it up again_ so sinners_ who have been convinced only and not converted_ return to sin again_ forgetting how sick it made them. The apostle (2 Pet.,20250223
2. How he condemns it. ,20250223
2. How he confirms his protestation. He does it_ as often before_ with a suitable imprecation,20250223
2. How he ratifies his protestation. So confident is he of his own honesty that_ ,20250223
2. How he reasoned against the temptation: Shall we receive good at the hand of God_ and shall we not receive evil also? Those whom we reprove we must endeavour to convince; and it is no hard matter to give a reason why we should still hold fast our integrity even when we are stripped of every thing else. He considers that_ though good and evil are contraries_ yet they do not come from contrary causes_ but both from the hand of God (Isa. xlv. 7_ Lam. iii.and therefore that in both we must have our eye up unto him_ with thankfulness for the good he sends and without fretfulness at the evil. Observe the force of his argument.,20250223
2. How ill Job thought of this sin_ v,20250223
2. How industrious a bad man is_ by concealing his badness_ to do hurt with it: The mouth of the wicked covers violence_ disguises the designed mischief with professions of friendship_ that it may be carried on the more securely and effectually_ as Joab kissed and killed_ Judas kissed and betrayed; this is his sin_ to which the punishment answers (v. 6): Violence covers the mouth of the wicked; what he got by violence shall by violence be taken from him_ Job v. 4_ 5.,20250223
2. How it is laid down (v. 5): The triumphing of the wicked is short_ and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment. Observe_ ,20250223
2. How much it will be for our advantage to ask the advice of our friends: In the multitude of counsellors (provided they be discreet and honest_ and will not give counsel with a spirit of contradiction) purposes are established. Solomon's son made no good use of this proverb when he acquiesced not in the counsel of the old men_ but because he would have a multitude of counsellors_ regarding number more than weight_ advised with the young men.,20250223
2. How they should be affected with the account of Job's troubles. Great enquiry_ no doubt_ would be made concerning him_ and every one would speak of him and his case; and what use will good people make of it? ,20250223
2. How undiscernible this difference is in the grave. As rich and poor_ so healthful and unhealthful_ meet there (v. 26): They shall lie down alike in the dust_ and the worms shall cover them_ and feed sweetly on them. Thus_ if one wicked man die in a palace and another in a dungeon_ they will meet in the congregation of the dead and damned_ and the worm that dies not_ and the fire that is not quenched_ will be the same to them_ which makes those differences inconsiderable and not worth perplexing ourselves about.,20250223
2. How weak man is. Can he do such things as these? Could Job? No_ v. 34_ 35. ,20250223
2. If at any time he bring them into affliction_ it is for the good of their souls_ v. 8-10. Some good people are preferred to honour and power_ but others are in trouble. Now observe_ ,20250223
2. If at any time we are inveigled into an evil way_ we must hasten out of it. __If_ ere thou wast aware_ thou didst enter in at the gate_ because it was wide_ go not on in the way of evil men. As soon as thou art made sensible of thy mistake_ retire immediately_ take not a step more_ stay not a minute longer_ in the way that certainly leads to destruction.__ 3. We must dread and detest the ways of sin and sinners_ and decline them with the utmost care imaginable. __The way of evil men may seem a pleasant way and sociable_ and the nearest way to the compassing of some secular end we may have in view; but it is an evil way_ and will end ill_ and therefore if thou love thy God and thy soul avoid it_ pass not by it_ that thou mayest not be tempted to enter into it; and_ if thou find thyself near it_ turn from it and pass away_ and get as far off it as thou canst.__ The manner of expression intimates the imminent danger we are in_ the need we have of this caution_ and the great importance of it_ and that our watchmen are_ or should be_ in good earnest_ in giving us warning. It intimates likewise at what a distance we should keep from sin and sinners; he does not say_ Keep at a due distance_ but at a great distance_ the further the better; never think you can get far enough from it. Escape for thy life: look not behind thee.,20250223
2. If he looked abroad_ he found he had a good interest and well confirmed. As he had no reason to dread the power of his enemies_ so neither had he any reason to distrust the fidelity of his friends. To the last moment of his prosperity they continued their respect to him and their dependence on him. What had he to fear who so gave counsel as in effect to give law to all his neighbours? Nothing surely could be done against him when really nothing was done without him.,20250223
2. If we consider hell beneath_ though it is out of our sight_ yet we may conceive the instances of God's power there. By hell and destruction (v. 6) we may understand the grave_ and those who are buried in it_ that they are under the eye of God_ though laid out of our sight_ which may strengthen our belief of the resurrection of the dead. God knows where to find_ and whence to fetch_ all the scattered atoms of the consumed body. We may also consider them as referring to the place of the damned_ where the separate souls of the wicked are in misery and torment. That is hell and destruction_ which are said to be before the Lord (Prov. xv. and here to be naked before him_ to which it is probable there is an allusion_ Rev. xiv. 10_ where sinners are to be tormented in the presence of the holy angels (who attended the Shechinah) and in the presence of the Lamb. And this may give light to v. 5_ which some ancient versions read thus (and I think more agreeably to the signification of the word Rephaim): Behold_ the giants groan under the waters_ and those that dwell with them; and then follows_ Hell is naked before him_ typified by the drowning of the giants of the old world; so the learned Mr. Joseph Mede understands it_ and with it illustrates Prov. xxi. 16_ where hell is called the congregation of the dead; and it is the same word which is here used_ and which he would there have rendered the congregation of the giants_ in allusion to the drowning of the sinners of the old world. And is there any thing in which the majesty of God appears more dreadful than in the eternal ruin of the ungodly and the groans of the inhabitants of the land of darkness? Those that will not with angels fear and worship shall for ever with devils fear and tremble; and God therein will be glorified.,20250223
2. In combat (v. 4): __Who hath hardened himself against him and hath prospered?__ The answer is very easy. You cannot produce any instance_ from the beginning of the world to this day_ of any daring sinner who has hardened himself against God_ has obstinately persisted in rebellion against him_ who did not find God too hard for him and pay dearly for his folly. Such transgressors have not prospered or had peace; they have had no comfort in their way nor any success. What did ever man get by trials of skill_ or trials of titles_ with his Maker? All the opposition given to God is but setting briers and thorns before a consuming fire; so foolish_ so fruitless_ so destructive_ is the attempt_ Isa. xxvii. 4; Ezek. xxviii. 24,20250223
2. In particular_ that we must not enter rashly into suretiship_ ,20250223
2. In the following verses Eliphaz addresses himself directly to Job_ and gives him many precious promises of great and kind things which God would do for him if he did but humble himself under his hand. Though then they had no Bibles that we know of_ yet Eliphaz had sufficient warrant to give Job these assurances_ from the general discoveries God had made of his good will to his people. And_ though in every thing which Job's friends said they were not directed by the Spirit of God (for they spoke both of God and Job some things that were not right)_ yet the general doctrines they laid down expressed the pious sense of the patriarchal age_ and as St. Paul quoted v. 13 for canonical scripture_ and as the command v. 17 is no doubt binding on us_ so these promises here may be_ and must be_ received and applied as divine promises_ and we may through patience and comfort of this part of scripture have hope. Let us therefore give diligence to make sure our interest in these promises_ and then view the particulars of them and take the comfort of them.,20250223
2. In this book we have_ ,20250223
2. Innovations in both are to be dreaded. Have nothing to do_ he does not say_ with those that change_ for there may be cause to change for the better_ but those that are given to change_ that affect change for change-sake_ out of a peevish discontent with that which is and a fondness for novelty_ or a desire to fish in troubled waters: Meddle not with those that are given to change either in religion or in a civil government; come not into their secret; join not with them in their cabals_ nor enter into the mystery of their iniquity,20250223
2. It impoverishes men and brings them to want. Those that will not labour cannot expect to eat_ but must suffer hunger: An idle soul_ one that is idle in the affairs of his soul_ that takes no care or pains to work out his salvation_ shall perish for want of that which is necessary to the life and happiness of the soul.,20250223
2. It is a true happiness; for it is inclusive of_ and equivalent to_ all those things which are supposed to make men happy_ v. 16_ 17. Wisdom is here represented as a bright and bountiful queen_ reaching forth gifts to her faithful and loving subjects_ and offering them to all that will submit to her government. ,20250223
2. It is applicable to any public deliverance of the church of God_ as particularly of Babylon_ the Old-Testament and the New-Testament Babylon; then the church is like pillars of smoke_ ascending upwards in devout affections_ the incense of praise_ from which_ as from Noah's sacrifice_ God smells a sweet savour; then she is amiable in the eyes of her friends_ and her enemies too cannot but have a veneration for her_ and worship at her feet_ knowing that God has loved her_ Rev. iii,20250223
2. It is certain that those who will not be reproved will be ruined: He that hates reproof_ and hardens his heart against it_ is joined to his idols; let him alone. He shall die_ and perish for ever_ in his sins_ since he would not be parted from his sins. 2 Chron. xxv. 15_ I know that God has determined to destroy thee_ because thou couldst not bear to be reproved; see also ch. xxix. 1.,20250223
2. It is not durable and abiding. Riches are very uncertain things; certainly they are so: They make themselves wings_ and fly away. The more we cause our eyes to fly upon them the more likely they are to fly away from us. ,20250223
2. It makes men impure and insolent_ v,20250223
2. It may be taken as a promise to all good kings_ that if they sincerely aim at God's glory_ and seek direction from him_ he will qualify them with wisdom and grace above others_ in proportion to the eminency of their station and the trusts lodged in their hands. When Saul himself was made king God gave him another spirit,20250223
2. It may be taken as a promise: Thou shalt come with me from Lebanon_ from the lions' dens; that is_ ,20250223
2. It may more easily be taken in a spiritual sense by the Christian church_ because the condescensions and communications of divine love appear more rich and free under the gospel than they did under the law_ and the communion between heaven and earth more familiar. God sometimes spoke of himself as the husband of the Jewish church (Isa. lxiv. 5_ Hos. ii. 16_,20250223
2. It was a word of terror to them. Christ's second coming will be very dreadful to those that are found smiting their fellow servants (Matt. xxiv. and therefore (v.,20250223
2. Job had an eye to himself in his repentance_ thought hardly of himself_ and thereby expressed his sorrow for his sins (v. 6): Wherefore I abhor myself_ and repent in dust and ashes. Observe_,20250223
2. Job's friends are greatly mortified_ and come off with disgrace. They were good men and belonged to God_ and therefore he would not let them lie still in their mistake any more than Job_ but_ having humbled him by a discourse out of the whirlwind_ he takes another course to humble them. Job_ who was dearest to him_ was first chidden_ but the rest in their turn. When they heard Job talked to_ it is probable_ they flattered themselves with a conceit that they were in the right and Job was in all the fault_ but God soon took them to task_ and made them know the contrary. In most disputes and controversies there is something amiss on both sides_ either in the merits of the cause or in the management_ if not in both; and it is fit that both sides should be told of it_ and made to see their errors. God addresses this to Eliphaz_ not only as the senior_ but as the ringleader in the attack made upon Job. Now_ ,20250223
2. Let him describe how this world was made_ and give a particular account of the manner in which this strong and stately edifice was formed and erected: __Declare_ if thou hast so much understanding as thou fanciest thyself to have_ what were the advances of that work.__ Those that pretend to have understanding above others ought to give proof of it. Show my thy faith by thy works_ thy knowledge by thy words. Let Job declare it if he can_ ,20250223
2. Let him not promise himself that_ if God's wrath should kindle against him_ he could find out ways to escape the strokes of it. ,20250223
2. Let him that is married take delight in his wife_ and let him be very fond of her_ not only because she is the wife that he himself has chosen and he ought to be pleased with his own choice_ but because she is the wife that God in his providence appointed for him and he ought much more to be pleased with the divine appointment_ pleased with her because she is his own. Let thy fountain be blessed (v. 18); think thyself very happy in her_ look upon her as a blessed wife_ let her have thy blessing_ pray daily for her_ and then rejoice with her. Those comforts we are likely to have joy of that are sanctified to us by prayer and the blessing of God. It is not only allowed us_ but commanded us_ to be pleasant with our relations; and it particularly becomes yoke-fellows to rejoice together and in each other. Mutual delight is the bond of mutual fidelity. It is not only taken for granted that the bridegroom rejoices over his bride (Isa. lxii. but given for law. Eccl. ix. 9_ Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life. Those take not their comforts where God has appointed who are jovial and merry with their companions abroad_ but sour and morose with their families at home.,20250223
2. Let them consider themselves_ and what an unequal match they were for this great God (v.,20250223
2. Let them know what will be advantages of this wisdom (v. 11): __By me thy days shall be multiplied. It will contribute to the health of thy body_ and so the years of thy life on earth shall be increased_ while men's folly and intemperance shorten their days. It will bring thee to heaven_ and there thy days shall be multiplied in infinitum—to infinity_ and the years of thy life shall be increased without end.__ There is no true wisdom but in the say of religion and no true life but in the end of that way.,20250223
2. Let them manage themselves discreetly_ be generous and not childish_ temperate and not luxurious_ ver. 16_ 17. Happy the nation when princes and people make conscience of their duty according to these rules.,20250223
2. Let us apply ourselves to the business of life while life lasts_ and so use the enjoyments of it as by them to be fitted for the employments: __Therefore eat with joy and a merry heart_ not that thy soul may take its ease (as Luke xii. but that thy soul may take the more pains and the joy of the Lord may be its strength and oil to its wheels___ v,20250223
2. Many frighten themselves from real duties by imaginary difficulties: The slothful man has work to do without in the fields_ but he fancies there is a lion there; nay_ he pretends he dares not go along the streets for fear somebody or other should meet him and kill him. He does not himself think so; he only says so to those that call him up. He talks of a lion without_ but considers not his real danger from the devil_ that roaring lion_ which is in bed with him_ and from his own slothfulness_ which kills him.,20250223
2. More particularly_ wisdom will preserve us_ ,20250223
2. No marvel then if we see the decays of man upon the earth_ for he is of the earth_ earthy. Job begins to think his case is not singular_ and therefore he ought to reconcile himself to the common lot. We perceive by many instances_ ,20250223
2. Note_ We should be ready to own how far we agree with those with whom we dispute_ and should not slight_ much less resist_ a truth_ though produced by an adversary and urged against us_ but receive it in the light and love of it_ though it may have been misapplied. __It is so of a truth_ that wickedness brings men to ruin and the godly are taken under God's special protection. These are truths which I subscribe to; but how can any man make good his part with God?__ In his sight shall no flesh living be justified_ Ps. cxliii,20250223
2. Now observe what she does_ in this case_ and what befel her. ,20250223
2. Now that which encouraged Job to hope that his present troubles would thus end well was the testimony of his conscience for him_ that he had lived a good life in the fear of God.,20250223
2. Of the world's insufficiency_ and religion's sufficiency_ to make us happy (ch. x. 2_ 3; xi. 4) and the preference to be therefore given to the gains of virtue above those of this world_ ch. xv. 16_ 17; xvi. 8_ 16; xvii. 1; xix. 1; xxviii. 6_ 11.,20250223
2. One can have no comfort in accepting the entertainments that are given grudgingly: __Eat not thou the bread of such a man; let him keep it to himself. Do not sponge upon those that are bountiful_ nor make thyself burdensome to any; but especially scorn to be beholden to those that are paltry and not sincere. Better have a dinner of herbs_ and true welcome_ than dainty meats without it. Therefore___ ,20250223
2. Others enjoy great prosperity and are of a cheerful spirit; and they have not only good days_ but have a continual feast; and if in the abundance of all things they serve God with gladness of heart_ and it is oil to the wheels of their obedience (all this_ and heaven too)_ then they serve a good Master. But let not such feast without fear; a sudden change may come; therefore rejoice with trembling.,20250223
2. Our opportunity for well-doing is very uncertain: __Thou knowest not what evil may be upon the earth_ which may deprive thee of thy estate_ and put thee out of a capacity to do good_ and therefore_ while thou hast wherewithal_ be liberal with it_ improve the present season_ as the husbandman in sowing his ground_ before the frost comes.__ We have reason to expect evil upon the earth_ for we are born to trouble; what the evil may be we know not_ but that we may be ready for it_ whatever it is_ it is our wisdom_ in the day of prosperity_ to be in good_ to be doing good. Many make use of this as an argument against giving to the poor_ because they know not what hard times may come when they may want themselves; whereas we should therefore the rather be charitable_ that_ when evil days come_ we may have the comfort of having done good while we were able; we would then hope to find mercy both with God and man_ and therefore should now show mercy. If by charity we trust God with what we have_ we put it into good hands against bad times.,20250223
2. Power and honour ill become a man of a servile spirit. Nothing is more unseemly than for a servant to have rule over princes; it is absurd in itself_ and very preposterous_ for none are so insolent and intolerable as a beggar on horseback_ a servant when he reigns_ ch. xxx,20250223
2. Rather let both prince and people act towards each other with prudence_ mildness_ and good temper: Wisdom is profitable to direct the ruler how to manage a people that are inclined to be turbulent_ so as neither_ on the one hand_ by a supine negligence to embolden and encourage them_ nor_ on the other hand_ by rigour and severity to exasperate and provoke them to any seditious practices. It is likewise profitable to direct the subjects how to act towards a prince that is inclined to bear hard upon them_ so as not to alienate his affections from them_ but to win upon him by humble remonstrances (not insolent demands_ such as the people made upon Rehoboam)_ by patient submissions and peaceable expedients. The same rule is to be observed in all relations_ for the preserving of the comfort of them. Let wisdom direct to gentle methods and forbear violent ones.,20250223
2. See how light these prospering sinners make of God and religion_ as if because they have so much of this world they had no need to look after another.,20250223
2. She begs he would visit it_ and accept of what it produced. The believer can take little pleasure in his garden_ unless Christ_ the beloved of his soul_ come to him_ nor have any joy of the fruits of it_ unless they redound some way or other to the glory of Christ_ and he will think all he has well bestowed upon him.,20250223
2. She begs of him that her union with him might be confirmed_ and her communion with him continued and made more intimate (v. 6): Set me as a seal upon thy heart_ as a seal upon thy arm.,20250223
2. She comforts herself with the thoughts of the communications of his grace to his people: He feeds among the lilies. When she wants the tokens of his favour to her in particular_ she rejoices in the assurance of his presence with all believers in general_ who are lilies in his eyes. He feeds among them_ that is_ he takes as much pleasure in them and their assemblies as a man does in his table or in his garden_ for he walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks; he delights to converse with them_ and to do them good.,20250223
2. She courted him to lie with her. They will sit down to eat and drink_ and then rise up to play_ to play the wanton_ and there is a bed ready for them_ where he shall find that which will be in all respects agreeable to him. To please his eye_ it is decked with coverings of tapestry and carved works_ exquisitely fine; he never saw the like. To please his touch_ the sheets are not of home-spun cloth; they are far-fetched and dear bought; they are of fine linen of Egypt_ v,20250223
2. She gives a particular detail of his accomplishments_ conceals not his power or comely proportion. Every thing in Christ is amiable. Ten instances she here gives of his beauty_ which we need not be nice in the application of_ lest the wringing of them bring forth blood and prove the wresting of them. The design_ in general_ is to show that he is every way qualified for his undertaking_ and has all that in him which may recommend him to our esteem_ love_ and confidence. Christ's appearance to John (Rev. i. 13_ &c.) may be compared with the description which the spouse gives of him here_ the scope of both being to represent him transcendently glorious_ that is_ both great and gracious_ made lovely in the eyes of believers and making them happy in himself. ,20250223
2. She gives an account how she came to be so black. The blackness was not natural_ but contracted_ and was owing to the hard usage that had been given her: Look not upon me so scornfully because I am black. We must take heed with what eye we look upon the church_ especially when she is in black. Thou shouldst not have looked upon the day of thy brother_ the day of his affliction_ Obad,20250223
2. She is a great blessing to her relations_ v,20250223
2. She is one that takes pains in the duty of her place and takes pleasure in it. This part of her character is much enlarged upon here. ,20250223
2. She is very confident of her own interest in him (v. 3): __I am my beloved's_ and my beloved is mine; the relation is mutual_ and the knot is tied_ which cannot be loosed; for he feeds among the lilies_ and my communion with him is a certain token of my interest in him.__ She had said this before (ch. ii. 16); but_ ,20250223
2. Sinners secured for ruin. Those that are wicked_ even their wickedness will be their overthrow at last_ and they are held in the cords of it in the mean time. Are they corrected_ destroyed? It is their own wickedness that corrects them_ that destroys them; they alone shall bear it.,20250223
2. Some will say that their sphere of usefulness is low and narrow; they cannot do the good that they see others can_ who are in more public stations_ and therefore they will sit still and do nothing. Nay_ says he_ in the place where the tree falls_ or happens to be_ there it shall be_ for the benefit of those to whom it belongs; every man must labour to be a blessing to that place_ whatever it is_ where the providence of God casts him; wherever we are we may find good work to do if we have but hearts to do it. Or thus: some will say_ __Many present themselves as objects of charity who are unworthy_ and I do not know whom it is fit to give it to.__ __Trouble not thyself about that__ (says Solomon); __give as discreetly as thou canst_ and then be satisfied that_ though the person should prove undeserving of thy charity_ yet_ if thou give it with an honest heart_ thou shalt not lose thy reward; which way soever the charity is directed_ north or south_ thine shall be the benefit of it.__ This is commonly applied to death; therefore let us do good_ and_ as good trees_ bring forth the fruits of righteousness_ because death will shortly come and cut us down_ and we shall then be determined to an unchangeable state of happiness or misery according to what was done in the body. As the tree falls at death_ so it is likely to lie to all eternity.,20250223
2. That God maintains us. Having lighted the lamp of life_ he does not leave it to burn upon its own stock_ but continually supplies it with fresh oil: __Thy visitation has preserved my spirit_ kept me alive_ protected me from the adversaries of life_ the death we are in the midst of and the dangers we are continually exposed to_ and blessed me with all the necessary supports of life and the daily supplies it needs and craves.__,20250223
2. That he had never been accessory to the wronging of any that were poor. It might be said_ perhaps_ that he was kind here and there to a poor orphan that was a favourite_ but to others he was oppressive. No_ he was tender to all and injurious to none. He never so much as lifted up his hand against the fatherless (v. never threatened or frightened them_ or offered to strike them; never used his power to crush those that stood in his way or squeeze what he could out of them_ though he saw his help in the gate_ that is_ though he had interest enough_ both in the people and in the judges_ both to enable him to do it and to bear him out when he had done it. Those that have it in their power to do a wrong thing and go through with it_ and a prospect of getting by it_ and yet do justly_ and love mercy_ and are firm to both_ may afterwards reflect upon their conduct with much comfort_ as Job does here.,20250223
2. That he was uneasy_ and even in pain_ to be delivered of his thoughts upon this matter. They must give him leave to speak_ for he cannot forbear; while he is musing the fire burns (Ps. xxxix.,20250223
2. That his present mistakes and miscarriages should be so strictly taken notice of_ and so severely animadverted upon (v. 27): __Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks_ not only to afflict me and expose me to shame_ not only to keep me from escaping the strokes of thy wrath_ but that thou mayest critically remark all my motions and look narrowly to all my paths_ to correct me for every false step_ nay_ for but a look awry or a word misapplied; nay_ thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet_ scorest down every thing I do amiss_ to reckon for it; or no sooner have I trodden wrong_ though ever so little_ than immediately I smart for it; the punishment treads upon the very heels of the sin. Guilt_ both of the oldest and of the freshest date_ is put together to make up the cause of my calamity.__ Now_ ,20250223
2. That his soul should prosper_ and he should be enriched with spiritual blessings_ which are the best blessings.,20250223
2. That it is worth while to do so_ for we may promise ourselves a great deal of comfort in a true friend. A brother indeed is born for adversity_ as he had said_ ch. xvii,20250223
2. That nothing is more pleasing to God than sincerity and plain-dealing: Such as are upright in their way_ such as aim and act with integrity_ such as have their conversation in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity_ not with fleshly wisdom_ these God delights in_ these he even boasts of (Hast thou considered my servant Job?) and will have us to admire. Behold an Israelite indeed!,20250223
2. That the gains of his business must all be left to others. Prospect of advantage is the spring of action and the spur of industry; therefore men labour_ because they hope to get by it; if the hope fail_ the labour flags; and therefore Solomon quarrelled with all the works_ the great works_ he had made_ because they would not be of any lasting advantage to himself. ,20250223
2. That they are insufficient to make us happy. And for this he appeals to men's consciences: What profit has a man of all the pains he takes? v,20250223
2. That we do not approach the borders of this sin_ v. 7_ 8.,20250223
2. That when the people are lessened the prince is weakened: In the want of people is the leanness of the prince (so some read it); trade lies dead_ the ground lies untilled_ the army wants to be recruited_ the navy to be manned_ and all because there are not hands sufficient. See how much the honour and safety of kings depend upon their people_ which is a reason why they should rule by love_ and not with rigour. Princes are corrected by those judgments which abate the number of the people_ as we find_ 2 Sam. xxiv. 13.,20250223
2. That wicked people_ and particularly oppressors and tyrannizing rulers_ are subject to continual terrors_ live very uncomfortably_ and perish very miserably. On this head he enlarges_ showing that even those who impiously dare God's judgments yet cannot but dread them and will feel them at last. He speaks in the singular number—the wicked man_ meaning (as some think) Nimrod; or perhaps Chedorlaomer_ or some such mighty hunter before the Lord. I fear he meant Job himself_ whom he expressly charges both with the tyranny and with the timorousness here described_ ch.,20250223
2. The advantages he gains thereby. These virtues will preserve his person and support his government_ will make him easy and safe_ beloved by his own people and feared by his enemies_ if it be possible that he should have any.,20250223
2. The application is very close (v. 21): For now you are nothing. They seemed to be somewhat_ but in conference they added nothing to him. Allude to Gal. ii,20250223
2. The application of mind that is required in order to learn of this master: Consider her ways. The sluggard is so because he does not consider; nor shall we ever learn to any purpose_ either by the word or the works of God_ unless we set ourselves to consider. Particularly_ if we would imitate others in that which is good_ we must consider their ways_ diligently observe what they do_ that we may do likewise_ Phil. iii. 17.,20250223
2. The beauty of the church and of believers is not only amiable_ but awful as an army with banners. The church_ in this world_ is as an army_ as the camp of Israel in the wilderness; its state is militant; it is in the midst of enemies_ and is engaged in a constant conflict with them. Believers are soldiers in this army. It has its banners; the gospel of Christ is an ensign (Isa. xi. the love of Christ_ ch. ii,20250223
2. The bounty and liberality of nature_ or rather of the God of nature_ and his providence (v.,20250223
2. The bridegroom's fellowship_ v,20250223
2. The clearness of the discovery of these things and the directing of them to us in particular.,20250223
2. The concern he is in about his sins. The best men have sin to complain of_ and the better they are the more they will complain of it. ,20250223
2. The direction that is given them to take special notice of that which they would not see every day_ and that was his crown_ either the crown of gold_ adorned with jewels_ which he wore on his coronation-day (Solomon's mother_ Bathsheba_ though she did not procure that for him_ yet_ by her seasonable interposal_ she helped to secure it to him when Adonijah was catching at it)_ or the garland or crown of flowers and green tied with ribbons which his mother made for him_ to adorn the solemnity of his nuptials. Perhaps Solomon's coronation day was his marriage-day_ the day of his espousals_ when the garland his mother crowned him with was added to the crown his people crowned him with. Applying this to Christ_ it speaks_ ,20250223
2. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity_ more unaccountable than any of these; it belongs to the depths of Satan_ that deceitfulness and that desperate wickedness of the heart which none can know_ Jer. xvii,20250223
2. The good presage of a kingdom's prosperity: In the multitude of counsellors_ that see their need one of another_ and act in concert and with concern for the public welfare_ there is safety; for what prudent methods one discerns not another may. In our private affairs we shall often find it to our advantage to advise with many; if they agree in their advice_ our way will be the more clear; if they differ_ we shall hear what is to be said on all sides_ and be the better able to determine.,20250223
2. The hope which the righteous have in their death. If Job had not had a good conscience_ he could not have spoken with this assurance of comfort on the other side death_ which turns the tables between the rich man and Lazarus. Now he is comforted_ and thou art tormented.,20250223
2. The imperfection of our knowledge. The greatest philosophers are much in the dark concerning the powers and works of nature. We are a paradox to ourselves_ and every thing about us is a mystery. The gravitation of bodies_ and the cohesion of the parts of matter_ are most certain_ and yet unaccountable. It is good for us to be made sensible of our own ignorance. Some have confessed their ignorance_ and those that would not do this have betrayed it. But we must all infer from it what incompetent judges we are of the divine politics_ when we understand so little even of the divine mechanics. ,20250223
2. The issue_ at length_ will be good: Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof. By faith see what the end will be_ and with patience expect it. When proud men begin to oppress their poor honest neighbours they think their power will bear them out in it; they doubt not but to carry the day_ and gain the point. But it will prove better in the end than it seemed at the beginning; their power will be broken_ their wealth gotten by oppression will be wasted and gone_ they will be humbled and brought down_ and reckoned with for their injustice_ and oppressed innocency will be both relieved and recompensed. Better was the end of Moses's treaty with Pharaoh_ that proud oppressor_ when Israel was brought forth with triumph_ than the beginning of it_ when the tale of bricks was doubled_ and every thing looked discouraging.,20250223
2. The judge will himself be judged for not judging aright. When Solomon saw how judgment was perverted among men he looked up to God the Judge_ and looked forward to the day of his judgment (v. 17): __I said in my heart that this unrighteous judgment is not so conclusive as both sides take it to be_ for there will be a review of the judgment; God shall judge between the righteous and the wicked_ shall judge for the righteous and plead their cause_ though now it is run down_ and judge against the wicked and reckon with them for all their unrighteous decrees and the grievousness which they have prescribed___ Isa. x. 1. With an eye of faith we may see_ not only the period_ but the punishment of the pride and cruelty of oppressors (Ps. xcii. and it is an unspeakable comfort to the oppressed that their cause will be heard over again. Let them therefore wait with patience_ for there is another Judge that stands before the door. And_ though the day of affliction may last long_ yet there is a time_ a set time_ for the examination of every purpose_ and every work done under the sun. Men have their day now_ but God's day is coming_ Ps. xxxvii,20250223
2. The justice which is here promised to be done him if he can perform such mighty works as these (v. 14): __They will I also confess unto thee that thy right hand is sufficient to save thee_ though_ after all_ it would be too weak to contend with me.__ It is the innate pride and ambition of man that he would be his own saviour (would have his own hands sufficient for him and be independent)_ but it is presumption to pretend that he is. Our own hands cannot save us by recommending us to God's grace_ much less by rescuing us from his justice. Unless we could by our own power humble our enemies_ we cannot pretend by our own power to save ourselves; but_ if we could_ God himself would confess it. He never did nor ever will defraud any man of his just praise_ nor deny him the honour he has merited. But_ since we cannot do this_ we must confess unto him that our own hands cannot save us_ and therefore into his hand we must commit ourselves.,20250223
2. The little difference there is between the conditions of the righteous and the wicked in this world: There is one event to both. Is David rich? So is Nabal. Is Joseph favoured by his prince? So is Haman. Is Ahab killed in a battle? So is Josiah. Are the bad figs carried to Babylon? So are the good_ Jer. xxiv. 1. There is a vast difference between the original_ the design_ and the nature_ of the same event to the one and to the other; the effects and issues of it are likewise vastly different; the same providence to the one is a savour of life unto life_ to the other of death unto death_ though_ to outward appearance_ it is the same.,20250223
2. The love of the world and the wealth of it. It is in worldly wealth that he places his happiness_ and therefore he sets his heart upon it. See here_ ,20250223
2. The manner in which he verifies this account. That which he undertakes to prove is that a worldly_ carnal_ earthly-minded man_ has no preeminence above the beast_ for all that which he sets his heart upon_ places his confidence_ and expects a happiness in_ is vanity_ v,20250223
2. The memorableness of the achievement_ that it is such as will be known and talked of hereafter. Many think they have found satisfaction enough in this_ that their names shall be perpetuated_ that posterity will celebrate the actions they have performed_ the honours they have won_ and the estates they have raised_ that their houses shall continue for ever (Ps. xlix. 11); but herein they deceive themselves. How many former things and persons were there_ which in their day looked very great and made a mighty figure_ and yet there is no remembrance of them; they are buried in oblivion. Here and there one person or action that was remarkable met with a kind historian_ and had the good hap to be recorded_ when at the same time there were others_ no less remarkable_ that were dropped: and therefore we may conclude that neither shall there be any remembrance of things to come_ but that which we hope to be remembered by will be either lost or slighted.,20250223
2. The more men have the more occasion they have for it_ and the more they have to do with it_ so that it is as broad as it is long: When goods increase_ they are increased that eat them_ v,20250223
2. The passionate inference he draws from it. From these premises he might have drawn a better conclusion that this (v. 11): Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak; I will complain. Holy David_ when he had been meditating on the frailty of human life_ made a contrary use of it (Ps. xxxix. 9_ I was dumb_ and opened not my mouth); but Job_ finding himself near expiring_ hastens as much to make his complaint as if he had been to make his last will and testament or as if he could not die in peace until he had given vent to his passion. When we have but a few breaths to draw we should spend them in the holy gracious breathings of faith and prayer_ not in the noisome noxious breathings of sin and corruption. Better die praying and praising than die complaining and quarrelling.,20250223
2. The prosperity of the wicked is here described to be_ ,20250223
2. The reason why we must thus make much of the words of wisdom is because they will be both food and physic to us_ like the tree of life_ Rev. xxii. 2; Ezek. xlvii,20250223
2. The result of this enquiry.,20250223
2. The son of David. His taking this title intimates_ ,20250223
2. The strong affection they have for Christ as their beloved_ their well-beloved_ v,20250223
2. The terror and trouble that seized his soul were the sorest part of his calamity_ v. 15_ 16. ,20250223
2. The unexceptionable justice of his proceedings. __Know therefore that_ how sore soever the correction is that thou art under_ God exacteth of thee less than thy iniquity deserves___ or (as some read it)_ __he remits thee part of thy iniquity_ and does not deal with thee according to the full demerit of it.__ Note_ ,20250223
2. Thence he infers how much less man is_ how much less to be trusted in or gloried in. If there is such a distance between God and angels_ what is there between God and man! See how man is represented here in his meanness.,20250223
2. There is nothing that is good to be gotten by a fool. Even his instruction_ his set and solemn discourses_ are but folly_ like himself_ and tending to make others like him. When he does his best it is but folly_ in comparison even with the common talk of a wise man_ who speaks better at table than a fool in Moses's seat.,20250223
2. These considerations Job here urges as reasons_ ,20250223
2. These two arguments he enlarges upon in the following verses_ only inverting the order_ and shows_,20250223
2. They are here compared to a spider's web_ or a spider's house (as it is in the margin)_ a cobweb_ v. 14_ 15. The hope of the hypocrite_ ,20250223
2. They are the words of one that was wise_ wiser than any_ endued with extraordinary measures of wisdom_ famous for it among his neighbours_ who all sought unto him to hear his wisdom_ and therefore a competent judge of this matter_ not only wise as a prince_ but wise as a preacher—and preachers have need of wisdom to win souls.,20250223
2. They broke him in pieces with words_ and those were surely hard and very cruel words that would break a man to pieces: they grieved him_ and so broke him; and therefore there will be a reckoning hereafter for all the hard speeches spoken against Christ and his people_ Jude 15,20250223
2. They do not take notice of the mercies they enjoy in and under their afflictions_ nor are thankful for them_ and therefore cannot expect that God should deliver them out of their afflictions.,20250223
2. They may prosper in their estates_ but ruin attends them too_ v. 16-18. ,20250223
2. They shall be happy in the success of their enquiries after him: __Those that seek me early_ seek an acquaintance with me and an interest in me_ seek me early_ that is_ seek me earnestly_ seek me first before any thing else_ that begin betimes in the days of their youth to seek me_ they shall find what they seek.__ Christ shall be theirs_ and they shall be his. He never said_ Seek in vain.,20250223
2. They shunned him as a loathsome spectacle_ abhorred him_ fled far from him_ (v. as an ugly monster or as one infected. Those that were themselves driven out from among men would have had him driven out. For_,20250223
2. This assertion of his own integrity he backs with a solemn imprecation of shame and confusion to himself if it were not true_ v,20250223
2. This dove is in the clefts of the rock and in the secret places of the stairs. This speaks either_,20250223
2. This knowledge is hidden in God_ as the apostle speaks_ Eph. iii,20250223
2. Those that do so forfeit the benefit of good advice and instruction_ and a wise man is not only allowed_ but advised_ not to speak in the ears of such fools; let them be foolish still_ and let not precious breath be thrown away upon them. If what a wise man says in his wisdom will not be heard_ let him hold his peace_ and try whether the wisdom of that will be regarded.,20250223
2. Those that have great treasure have often great trouble therewith; it is so far from making them easy that it increases their care and hurry. The abundance of the rich will not suffer them to sleep,20250223
2. Those that thus desert the post assigned to them are like a bird that wanders from her nest. It is an instance of their folly; they are like a silly bird; they are always wavering_ like the wandering bird that hops from bough to bough and rests nowhere. It is unsafe; the bird that wanders is exposed; a man's place is his castle; he that quits it makes himself an easy prey to the fowler. When the bird wanders from her nest the eggs and young ones there are neglected. Those that love to be abroad leave their work at home undone. Let every man therefore_ in the calling wherein he is called_ therein abide_ therein abide with God.,20250223
2. Though good men may have but little of the world_ yet that little will last_ and what is honestly got will wear well: The root of the righteous shall not be moved_ though their branches may be shaken. Those that by faith are rooted in Christ are firmly fixed; in him their comfort and happiness are so rooted as never to be rooted up.,20250223
2. To confirm this truth_ that an eye to God must both direct and quicken all our pursuits of knowledge_ he observes_ Fools (atheists_ who have no regard to God) despise wisdom and instruction; having no dread at all of God's wrath_ nor any desire of his favour_ they will not give you thanks for telling them what they may do to escape his wrath and obtain his favour. Those who say to the Almighty_ Depart from us_ who are so far from fearing him that they set him at defiance_ can excite no surprise if they desire not the knowledge of his ways_ but despise that instruction. Note_ Those are fools who do not fear God and value the scriptures; and though they may pretend to be admirers of wit they are really strangers and enemies to wisdom.,20250223
2. To encourage us to submit ourselves to all the restraints and injunctions of the divine law_ we are assured (v. 2) that it is the certain way to long life and prosperity. ,20250223
2. Two reasons are here given why we should speedily and cheerfully pay our vows:—,20250223
2. Under our feet_ to teach us not to lay them in our bosoms_ nor to set our hearts upon them_ but to trample upon them with a holy contempt. See how full the earth is of God's riches (Ps. civ. 24) and infer thence_ not only how great a God he is whose the earth is and the fulness thereof (Ps. xxiv. 1)_ but how full heaven must needs be of God's riches_ which is the city of the great King_ in comparison with which this earth is a poor country.,20250223
2. Upon this strained innuendo Eliphaz grounds that high charge of impiety (v. 5): Thy mouth utters thy iniquity—teaches it_ so the word is. __Thou teachest others to have the same hard thoughts of God and religion that thou thyself hast.__ It is bad to break even the least of the commandments_ but worse to teach men so_ Matt. v,20250223
2. We are encouraged to depend upon the power of God_ which would keep us from all that fear of man which has either torment or temptation in it. Whoso puts his trust in the Lord_ for protection and supply in the way of duty_ shall be set on high_ above the power of man and above the fear of that power. A holy confidence in God makes a man both great and easy_ and enables him to look with a gracious contempt upon the most formidable designs of hell and earth against him. If God be my salvation_ I will trust and not be afraid.,20250223
2. We may from them learn the wisdom_ power_ and goodness of God_ and that sovereign dominion of his into which plain and self-evident truth all these difficult dispensations must be resolved. Zophar had made a vast mystery of it_ ch. xi,20250223
2. We must accommodate ourselves to the various dispensations of Providence that respect us_ and do the work and duty of the day in its day_ v,20250223
2. We must be conscientious doers of the work_ for we are blessed only in our deed. It is not enough to hearken unto Wisdom's words_ but we must keep her ways (v. do every thing that she prescribes_ keep within the hedges of her ways_ and not transgress them_ keep in the tracks of her ways_ proceed and persevere in them. __Hear instruction and be wise; let it be a means to make you wise in ordering your conversation.__ What we know is known in vain if it do not make us wise_,20250223
2. We must be much in prayer_ v,20250223
2. We must not irritate the passions of others. Some are so very provoking in their words and conduct that they even force wrath_ they make those about them angry whether they will or no_ and put those into a passion who are not only not inclined to it_ but resolved against it. Now this forcing of wrath brings forth strife_ and where that is there is confusion and every evil work. As the violent agitation of the cream fetches all the good out of the milk_ and the hard wringing of the nose will extort blood from it_ so this forcing of wrath wastes both the body and spirits of a man_ and robs him of all the good that is in him. Or_ as it is in the churning of milk and the wringing of the nose_ that is done by force which otherwise would not be done_ so the spirit is heated by degrees with strong passions; one angry word begets another_ and that a third; one passionate debate makes work for another_ and so it goes on till it ends at length in irreconcilable feuds. Let nothing therefore be said or done with violence_ but every thing with softness and calmness.,20250223
2. We must put on patience_ bearing patience_ to submit to the will of God in the affliction_ and waiting patience_ to expect the issue in God's due time. The patient in spirit are here opposed to the proud in spirit_ for where there is humility there will be patience. Those will be thankful for any thing who own they deserve nothing at God's hand_ and the patient are said to be better than the proud; they are more easy to themselves_ more acceptable to others_ and more likely to see a good issue of their troubles.,20250223
2. We must receive it as our father's commandment and the law of our mother_ v,20250223
2. We must take heed that the sacrifice we bring be not the sacrifice of fools (of wicked men)_ for they are fools and their sacrifice is an abomination to the Lord_ Prov. xv. that we bring not the torn_ and the lame_ and the sick for sacrifice_ for we are plainly told that it will not be accepted_ and therefore it is folly to bring it_—that we rest not in the sign and ceremony_ and the outside of the performance_ without regarding the sense and meaning of it_ for that is the sacrifice of fools. Bodily exercise_ if that be all_ is a jest; none but fools will think thus to please him who is a Spirit and requires the heart_ and they will see their folly when they find what a great deal of pains they have taken to no purpose for want of sincerity. They are fools_ for they consider not that they do evil; they think they are doing God and themselves good service when really they are putting a great affront upon God and a great cheat upon their own souls by their hypocritical devotions. Men may be doing evil even when they profess to be doing good_ and even when they do not know it_ when they do not consider it. They know not but to do evil_ so some read it. Wicked minds cannot choose but sin_ even in the acts of devotion. Or_ They consider not that they do evil; they act at a venture_ right or wrong_ pleasing to God or not_ it is all one to them.,20250223
2. We must trade for it. We read here of the merchandise of wisdom_ which intimates_ ,20250223
2. What a great deal of honour and power he had in his country_ and what respect was paid him by all sorts of people_ ver. 7-10,20250223
2. What arguments are here used to engage us to be subject to the higher powers; they are much the same with those which St. Paul uses_ Rom. xiii. 1_ &c. ,20250223
2. What different sorts of persons they would meet with_ and what course they must take with them_ and what success they might expect.,20250223
2. What his doom is (v. 15): His calamity shall come and he shall be broken; he that devised mischief shall fall into mischief. His ruin shall come_ ,20250223
2. What low things are here said of man_ and very truly and justly (v. 4): How then can man be justified with God? Or how can he be clean? Man is not only mean_ but vile_ not only earthly_ but filthy; he cannot be justified_ he cannot be clean_ ,20250223
2. What supported him under it. ,20250223
2. What the reasons were which_ in this matter_ he was governed by. It was not for fear of reproach among men_ though that is to be considered (Prov. vi. but for fear of the wrath and curse of God. He knew very well_ ,20250223
2. What their doom will be. Those that dishonour their parents shall be set up as monuments of God's vengeance; they shall be hanged in chains_ as it were_ for the birds of prey to pick out their eyes_ those eyes with which they looked so scornfully on their good parents. The dead bodies of malefactors were not to hang all night_ but before night the ravens would have picked out their eyes. If men do not punish undutiful children_ God will_ and will load those with the greatest infamy that conduct themselves haughtily towards their parents. Many who have come to an ignominious end have owned that the wicked courses that brought them to it began in a contempt of their parents' authority.,20250223
2. What these instructions were_ v. 4-13.,20250223
2. What were the considerations that moved him to treat his servants thus kindly. He had_ herein_ an eye to God_ both as his Judge and their Maker. ,20250223
2. What will be our comfort when we are in affliction. ,20250223
2. When bad men are disgraced_ degraded_ and their power taken from them_ then that which is good revives again_ then the righteous increase; for_ when they perish_ good men will be put in their room_ who will_ by their example and interest_ countenance religion and righteousness. It is well with a land when the number of good people increases in it; and it is therefore the policy of all princes_ states_ and potentates_ to encourage them and to take special care of the good education of youth.,20250223
2. Why we should have this in our eye_ in the management of ourselves as to this world_ and look up to God for it. ,20250223
2. With what constancy he depends upon him: Though he slay me_ yet will I trust in him_ v.,20250223
2. Yet his success was not answerable or satisfying: __I said_ I will be wise_ but it was far from me; I could not compass it. After all_ This only I know that I know nothing_ and the more I know the more I see there is to be known_ and the more sensible I am of my own ignorance. That which is far off_ and exceedingly deep_ who can find it out?__ He means God himself_ his counsels and his works; when he searched into these he presently found himself puzzled and run aground. He could not order his speech by reason of darkness. It is higher than heaven_ what can he do? Job xi,20250223
2. Yet we must not rest in these things. We must not be always children that have need of milk_ but nourished up with that_ and gaining strength_ we must go on to perfection (Heb. vi. 1)_ that having_ by reason of use_ our spiritual senses exercised (Heb. v. we may come to full age_ and put away childish things_ and_ forgetting the things which are behind_ that is_ so well remembering them (Phil. iii. 13) that we need not be still poring over them as those that are ever learning the same lesson_ we may reach forth to the things which are before. Though we must never think to learn above our Bible_ as long as we are here in this world_ yet we must still be getting forward in it. You have dwelt long enough in this mountain; now turn and take your journey onward in the wilderness towards Canaan. Our motto must be Plus ultra—Onward. And then shall we know if thus_ by regular steps (Hos. vi. we follow on to know the Lord and what the mind of the Lord is.,20250223
20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.,20250223
20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.,20250223
20 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.,20250223
20 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather_ and as vinegar upon nitre_ so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.,20250223
20 Behold_ God will not cast away a perfect man_ neither will he help the evil doers: 21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing_ and thy lips with rejoicing. 22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.,20250223
20 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.,20250223
20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the Lord_ happy is he.,20250223
20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.,20250223
20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.,20250223
20 Hear counsel_ and receive instruction_ that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.,20250223
20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.,20250223
20 My son_ attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. 21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. 22 For they are life unto those that find them_ and health to all their flesh. 23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. 24 Put away from thee a froward mouth_ and perverse lips put far from thee. 25 Let thine eyes look right on_ and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. 26 Ponder the path of thy feet_ and let all thy ways be established. 27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.,20250223
20 My son_ keep thy father's commandment_ and forsake not the law of thy mother: 21 Bind them continually upon thine heart_ and tie them about thy neck. 22 When thou goest_ it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest_ it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest_ it shall talk with thee. 23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: 24 To keep thee from the evil woman_ from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. 25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. 26 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. 27 Can a man take fire in his bosom_ and his clothes not be burned? 28 Can one go upon hot coals_ and his feet not be burned? 29 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. 30 Men do not despise a thief_ if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; 31 But if he be found_ he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. 32 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. 34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content_ though thou givest many gifts.,20250223
20 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.,20250223
20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.,20250223
20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. 21 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.,20250223
20 Then Job arose_ and rent his mantle_ and shaved his head_ and fell down upon the ground_ and worshipped_ 21 And said_ Naked came I out of my mother's womb_ and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave_ and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. 22 In all this Job sinned not_ nor charged God foolishly.,20250223
20 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.,20250223
20 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the Lord: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.,20250223
20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living_ and kept close from the fowls of the air. 22 Destruction and death say_ We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 23 God understandeth the way thereof_ and he knoweth the place thereof. 24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth_ and seeth under the whole heaven; 25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. 26 When he made a decree for the rain_ and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 27 Then did he see it_ and declare it; he prepared it_ yea_ and searched it out. 28 And unto man he said_ Behold_ the fear of the Lord_ that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.,20250223
20 Where no wood is_ there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer_ the strife ceaseth. 21 As coals are to burning coals_ and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. 22 The words of a talebearer are as wounds_ and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.,20250223
20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery_ and life unto the bitter in soul; 21 Which long for death_ but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; 22 Which rejoice exceedingly_ and are glad_ when they can find the grave? 23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid_ and whom God hath hedged in? 24 For my sighing cometh before I eat_ and my roarings are poured out like the waters. 25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me_ and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. 26 I was not in safety_ neither had I rest_ neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.,20250223
20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother_ his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.,20250223
20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: 21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse_ in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words_ saying_,20250223
20)_ and his dwelling-place should come to nought_ v,20250223
20)_ because as he sows so he must reap_ Gal. vi,20250223
20)_ turn it off with a jest_ rush into sin (Jer. viii. 6) and say they shall have peace though they go on. They care not what mischief they do by their sins_ and laugh at those that tell them of it. They are advocates for sin_ and are ingenious at framing excuses for it. Fools make a mock at the sin-offering (so some); those that make light of sin make light of Christ. Those are fools that make light of sin_ for they make light of that which God complains of (Amos ii. which lay heavily upon Christ_ and which they themselves will have other thoughts of shortly,20250223
20): He removeth away the speech of the trusty_ so that they cannot speak as they intended and as they used to do_ with freedom and clearness_ but blunder_ and falter_ and make nothing of it. Or they cannot speak what they intended_ but the contrary_ as Balaam_ who blessed those whom he was called to curse. Let not the orator therefore be proud of his rhetoric_ nor use it to any bad purposes_ lest God take it away_ who made man's mouth. ,20250223
20); to the godly it is Bethabara_ a passage-house in their way home. __It is my house_ mine by descent_ I am born to it; it is my father's house. It is mine by purchase. I have made myself obnoxious to it.__ We must everyone of us shortly remove to this house_ and it is our wisdom to provide accordingly; let us think of removing_ and send before to our long home. ,20250223
20. And it is upon this account that he asks_ How dies the wise man? As the fool. Between the death of a godly and a wicked man there is a great difference_ but not between the death of a wise man and a fool; the fool is buried and forgotten (ch. viii. and no one remembered the poor man that by his wisdom delivered the city (ch. ix. 15); so that to both the grave is a land of forgetfulness; and wise and learned men_ when they have been awhile there out of sight_ grow out of mind_ a new generation arises that knew them not.,20250223
20. Nay_ God will so order it that the just shall wear his raiment and the innocent shall divide his silver. ,20250223
20. Of good and bad women_ or wives_ ,20250223
20. This is that fruit of wisdom which is better than gold_ than fine gold_ it leads us in the way of righteousness_ shows us that way and goes before us in it_ the way that God would have us walk in and which will certainly bring us to our desired end. It leads in the midst of the paths of judgment_ and saves us from deviating on either hand. In medio virtus—Virtue lies in the midst. Christ by his,20250223
20. Thy servant went nowhere. In saying that he had walked to and fro through the earth_ he intimates that he had kept himself within the bounds allotted him_ and had not transgressed his bounds; for the dragon is cast out into the earth (Rev. xii. 9) and not yet confined to his place of torment. While we are on this earth we are within his reach_ and with so much subtlety_ swiftness_ and industry_ does he penetrate into all the corners of it_ that we cannot be in any place secure from his temptations.,20250223
21 Acquaint now thyself with him_ and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.,20250223
21 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.,20250223
21 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth_ and cleanseth them. 22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty. 23 Touching the Almighty_ we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power_ and in judgment_ and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict. 24 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.,20250223
21 As the fining pot for silver_ and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.,20250223
21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.,20250223
21 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.,20250223
21 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.,20250223
21 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.,20250223
21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.,20250223
21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor_ happy is he.,20250223
21 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life_ righteousness_ and honour.,20250223

Men pervert justice sometimes for fear of the power of others (but God is Almighty_ and stands in awe of none)_ sometimes to obtain the favour of others; but God is all-sufficient_ and cannot be benefited by the favour of any. It is man's weakness and impotency that he often is unjust; it is God's omnipotence that he cannot be so,20250223

26. Job complained that his kindred were estranged from him (ch. xix. 13_ 14); therefore here he claims acquaintance with other relations that would cleave to him when those disowned him. Note_ First_ We are all of us near akin to corruption and the worms. Secondly_ It is therefore good to make ourselves familiar with them_ by conversing much with them in our thoughts and meditations_ which would very much help us above the inordinate love of life and fear of death.,20250223

3. A comfortable reflection upon their past troubles (v. 16): __Thou shalt forget thy misery_ as the mother forgets her travailing pains_ for joy that the child is born; thou shalt be perfectly freed from the impressions it makes upon thee_ and thou shalt remember it as waters that pass away_ or are poured out of a vessel_ which leave no taste or tincture behind them_ as other liquors do. The wounds of thy present affliction shall be perfectly healed_ not only without a remaining scar_ but without a remaining pain.__ Job had endeavoured to forget his complaint (ch. ix. but found he could not; his soul had still in remembrance the wormwood and the gall: but here Zophar puts him in a way to forget it; let him by faith and prayer bring his griefs and cares to God_ an leave them with him_ and then he shall forget them. Where sin sits heavily affliction sits lightly. If we duly remember our sins_ we shall_ in comparison with them_ forget our misery_ much more if we obtain the comfort of a sealed pardon and a settled peace. He whose iniquity is forgiven shall not say_ I am sick_ but shall forget his sickness_ Isa. xxxiii. 24.,20250223
3. A joyful expectation of bliss and satisfaction in this (v. 15): Then thou shalt call_ and I will answer thee. Now_ he was under such a cloud that he could not_ he durst not_ answer (ch. ix. 15_ 35; xiii. 22); but he comforted himself with this_ that there would come a time when God would call and he should answer. Then_ that is_ ,20250223

3. Because the hypocrite's religion is neither comfortable nor constant (v. 10): Will he delight himself in the Almighty? No_ not at any time (for his delight is in the profits of the world and the pleasures of the flesh_ more than in God)_ especially not in the time of trouble. Will he always call upon God? No_ in prosperity he will not call upon God_ but slight him; in adversity he will not call upon God but curse him; he is weary of his religion when he gets nothing by it_ or is in danger of losing.

3. Christ graciously calls her out of her retirements: Come_ let me see thy countenance_ let me hear thy voice. She was mourning like a dove (Isa. xxxviii. bemoaning herself like the doves of the valleys_ where they are near the clefts of the impending rocks_ mourning for her iniquities (Ezek. vii. 16) and refusing to be comforted. But Christ calls her to lift up her face without spot_ being purged from an evil conscience (Job xi. 15; xxii. to come boldly to the throne of grace_ having a great high priest there (Heb. iv. to tell what her petition is and what her request: Let me hear thy voice_ hear what thou hast to say; what would you that I should do unto you? Speak freely_ speak up_ and fear not a slight or repulse.,20250223
3. Destruction attends their persons_ though they lived long in health and at ease (v. 19): The rich man shall lie down to sleep_ to repose himself in the abundance of his wealth (Soul_ take thy ease)_ shall lie down in it as his strong city_ and seem to others to be very happy and very easy; but he shall not be gathered_ that is_ he shall not have his mind composed_ and settled_ and gathered in_ to enjoy his wealth.

3. For the righteous to be cowardly_ to truckle to the wicked_ to be afraid of opposing his wickedness and basely to yield to him_ this is a reflection upon religion_ a discouragement to good men_ and strengthens the hands of sinners in their sins_ and so is like a troubled fountain and a corrupt spring.,20250223
3. Give my thy heart_ v God in this exhortation_ speaks to us as unto children: __Son_ Daughter_ Give my thy heart.__ The heart is that which the great God requires and calls for from every one of us; whatever we give_ if we do not give him our hearts_ it will not be accepted. We must set our love upon him. Our thoughts must converse much with him_ and on him_ as our highest end. The intents of our hearts must be fastened. We must make it our own act and deed to devote ourselves to the Lord_ and we must be free and cheerful in it. We must not think to divide the heart between God and the world; he will have all or none. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. To this call we must readily answer_ __My father_ take my heart_ such as it is_ and make it such as it should be; take possession of it_ and set up thy throne in it.__,20250223
3. God is a strict and just observer of the children of men (v. 11): He knows vain men. We know little of him_ but he knows us perfectly: He sees wickedness also_ not to approve it (Hab. i.,20250223
3. God is preparing for his destruction. The sinner by his sin is preparing the fuel and then God by his wrath is preparing the fire. See here_ ,20250223
3. God is righteous_ and_ in all his proceedings_ goes according to the rules of equity. Even when he is overturning mighty men_ and breaking them in pieces_ yet he will not lay upon man more than right_ v,20250223
3. He complains of his life_ and that ever he was born to all this trouble and misery (v. 18_ 19): __If this was designed for my lot_ why was I brought out of the womb_ and not smothered there_ or stifled in the birth?__ This was the language of his passion_ and it was a relapse into the same sin he fell into before. He had just now called life a favour (v. yet now he calls it a burden_ and quarrels with God for giving it_ or rather laying it upon him. Mr. Caryl gives this a good turn in favour of Job. __We may charitably suppose___ says he_ __that what troubled Job was that he was in a condition of life which (as he conceived) hindered the main end of his life_ which was the glorifying of God. His harp was hung on the willow-trees_ and he was quite out of tune for praising God. Nay_ he feared lest his troubles should reflect dishonour upon God and give occasion to his enemies to blaspheme; and therefore he wishes_ O that I had given up the ghost! A godly man reckons that he lives to no purpose if he do not live to the praise and glory of God.__ If that was his meaning_ it was grounded on a mistake; for we may glorify the Lord in the fires. But this use we may make of it_ not to be over-fond of life_ since the case has been such sometimes_ even with wise and good men_ that they have complained of it. Why should we dread giving up the ghost_ or covet to be seen of men_ since the time may come when we may be ready to wish we had given up the ghost and no eye had seen us? Why should we inordinately lament the death of our children in their infancy_ that are as if they had not been_ and are carried from the womb to the grave_ when perhaps we ourselves may sometimes wish it had been our own lot?,20250223
3. He expects rent from those that are employed in his vineyard and entrusted with it. He comes_ seeking fruit_ and requires gospel-duty of all those that enjoy gospel-privileges. Every one_ of what rank or degree soever_ must bring glory and honour to Christ_ and do some service to the interest of his kingdom in the world_ in consideration of what benefit and advantage they enjoy by their share of the privileges of the vineyard,20250223
3. He found that when he had got some knowledge he could neither gain that satisfaction to himself nor do that good to others with it which he expected_ v,20250223
3. He gave for a reason the return of the spring_ and the pleasantness of the weather.,20250223
3. He gave glory to God_ and expressed himself upon this occasion with a great veneration for the divine Providence_ and a meek submission to its disposals. We may well rejoice to find Job in this good frame_ because this was the very thing upon which the trial of his integrity was put_ though he did not know it. The devil said that he would_ under his affliction_ curse God; but he blessed him_ and so proved himself an honest man.,20250223
3. He gives him fair warning of the fatal consequences of his slothfulness_ v,20250223
3. He had 3000 camels_ and servants tending them; and he lost them all at the same time by the Chaldeans_ who came in three bands_ and drove them away_ and slew the servants_ v,20250223
3. He had observed that their prosperity hardened them in their wickedness_ v,20250223
3. He has particularly provided that good men_ who are sincerely disposed to do his will_ shall have that knowledge and that understanding which are necessary for them_ John vii,20250223
3. He is so sure of a sentence in favour of him that he even longed to hear it (v. 5): __I would know the words which he would answer me___ that is_ __I would gladly hear what God will say to this matter in dispute between you and me_ and will entirely acquiesce in his judgment.__ This becomes us_ in all controversies; let the word of God determine them; let us know what he answers_ and understand what he says. Job knew well enough what his friends would answer him; they would condemn him_ and run him down. __But__ (says he) __I would fain know what God would answer me; for I am sure his judgment is according to truth_ which theirs is not. I cannot understand them; they talk so little to the purpose. But what he says I should understand and therefore be fully satisfied in.__,20250223
3. He is supposed to have a numerous family_ to beget a hundred children_ which are the stay and strength of his house and as a quiver full of arrows to him_ which are the honour and credit of his house_ and in whom he has the prospect of having his name built up and having all the immortality this world can give him. They are full of children (Ps. xvii. while many of God's people are written childless and stripped of all.,20250223
3. He laid out a great deal of money in water-works_ ponds_ and canals_ not for sport and diversion_ but for use_ to water the wood that brings forth trees (v. 6); he not only planted_ but watered_ and then left it to God to give the increase. Springs of water are great blessings (Josh. xv.,20250223
3. He lodges under the shady trees (v. which cover him with their shadow (v. where he has a free and open air to breathe in_ while lions_ which live by prey_ when they would repose themselves_ are obliged to retire into a close and dark den_ to live therein_ and to abide in the covert of that_ ch. xxxviii,20250223
3. He reads the doom of those that continue obstinate against all these means and methods of grace. It is large and very terrible_ v. 24-32. Wisdom_ having called sinners to return_ pauses awhile_ to see what effect the call has_ hearkens and hears; but they speak not aright (Jer. viii. and therefore she goes on to tell them what will be in the end hereof.,20250223
3. He recommends this as that which is very graceful and will put an honour upon us: __The instructions and laws of thy parents_ carefully observed and lived up to_ shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head (v. such an ornament as is_ in the sight of God_ of great price_ and shall make thee look as great as those that wear gold chains about their necks.__ Let divine truths and commands be to us a coronet_ or a collar of SS_ which are badges of first-rate honours; let us value them_ and be ambitious of them_ and then they shall be so to us. Those are truly valuable_ and shall be valued_ who value themselves more by their virtue and piety than by their worldly wealth and dignity.,20250223
3. He sent to them to prepare for solemn ordinances_ sent and sanctified them_ ordered them to examine their own consciences and repent of what they had done amiss in their feasting_ to lay aside their vanity and compose themselves for religious exercises. Thus he kept his authority over them for their good_ and they submitted to it_ though they had got into houses of their own. Still he was the priest of the family_ and at his altar they all attended_ valuing their share in his prayers more than their share in his estate. Parents cannot give grace to their children (it is God that sanctifies)_ but they ought by seasonable admonitions and counsels to further their sanctification. In their baptism they were sanctified to God; let it be our desire and endeavour that they may be sanctified for him.,20250223
3. He shall be disquieted and troubled in his mind: Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly_ v,20250223
3. He thinks it looked like an abuse of his omnipotence to keep a poor prisoner in custody_ whom he knew to be innocent_ only because there was none that could deliver him out of his hand,20250223
3. He valued himself by the conscience he made of justice and equity in all his proceedings. His friends had unjustly censured him as an oppressor. __So far from that___ says he_ __I always made it my business to maintain and support right.__ ,20250223
3. He was a man of sorrows_ v,20250223
3. He was one that made it his business to do good_ and to use wisdom aright. Because he was himself wise_ but knew he had not his wisdom for himself_ any more than he had it from himself_ he still taught the people that knowledge which he had found useful to himself_ and hoped might be so to them too. It is the interest of princes to have their people well taught in religion_ and no disparagement to them to teach them themselves the good knowledge of the Lord_ but their duty to encourage those whose office it is to teach them and to speak comfortably to them_ 2 Chron. xxx.,20250223
3. He yet seems to give some representation of his own character. ,20250223
3. His bodily diseases were very grievous; for_ ,20250223
3. His body was noisome_ v,20250223
3. How he appeals from them to God (v. 3): Lay down now_ put me in a surety with thee_ that is_ __Let me be assured that God will take the hearing and determining of the cause into his own hands_ and I desire no more. Let some one engage for God to bring on this matter.__ Thus those whose hearts condemn them not have confidence towards God_ and can with humble and believing boldness beg of him to search and try them. Some make Job here to glance at the mediation of Christ_ for he speaks of a surety with God_ without whom he durst not appear before God_ nor try his cause at his bar; for_ though his friends' accusations of him were utterly false_ yet he could not justify himself before God but in a mediator. Our English annotations give this reading of the verse: __Appoint_ I pray thee_ my surety with thee_ namely_ Christ who is with thee in heaven_ and has undertaken to be my surety let him plead my cause_ and stand up for me; and who is he then that will strike upon my hand?__ that is_ __Who dares then contend with me? Who shall lay any thing to my charge if Christ be an advocate for me?__ Rom. viii. 32_ 33. Christ is the surety of the better testament (Heb. vii. a surety of God's appointing; and_ if he undertake for us_ we need not fear what can be done against us.,20250223
3. How it is illustrated_ v. 6-9. ,20250223
3. If the affliction do its work_ and accomplish that for which it is sent_ he will comfort them again_ according to the time that he has afflicted them (v. 11): If they obey and serve him_—if they comply with his design and serve his purpose in these dispensations_—if_ when the affliction is removed_ they continue in the same good mind that they were in when they were under the smart of it and perform the vows they made then_—if they live in obedience to God's commands_ particularly those which relate to his service and worship_ and in all instances make conscience of their duty to him_—then they shall spend their days in prosperity again and their years in true pleasures. Piety is the only sure way to prosperity and pleasure; this is a certain truth_ and yet few will believe it. If we faithfully serve God_ ,20250223
3. If we look up to heaven above_ we shall see instances of God's sovereignty and power. ,20250223
3. In the last verse he recommends these promises to Job_ ,20250223
3. It is the happiness of paradise (v. 18): She is a tree of life. True grace is that to the soul which the tree of life would have been_ from which our first parents were shut out for eating of the forbidden tree. It is a seed of immortality_ a well of living waters_ springing up to life eternal. It is an earnest of the New Jerusalem_ in the midst of which is the tree of life_ Rev. xxii. 2; ii,20250223
3. It stupefies and besots men_ v,20250223
3. King of Jerusalem. This he mentions_ ,20250223
3. Let him be fond of his wife and love her dearly (v. 19): Let her be as the loving hind and the pleasant roe_ such as great men sometimes kept tame in their houses and played with. Desire no better diversion from severe study and business than the innocent and pleasant conversation of thy own wife; let her lie in thy bosom_ as the poor man's ewe-lamb did in his (2 Sam. xii. and do thou repose thy head in hers_ and let that satisfy thee at all times; and seek not for pleasure in any other. __Err thou always in her love. If thou wilt suffer thy love to run into an excess_ and wilt be dotingly fond of any body_ let it be only of thy own wife_ where there is least danger of exceeding.__ This is drinking waters_ to quench the thirst of thy appetite_ out of thy own cistern_ and running waters_ which are clear_ and sweet_ and wholesome_ out of thy own well_ v,20250223
3. Let him not continue his unjust quarrel with God and his providence_ which hitherto he had persisted in when he should have submitted to the affliction (v. 21): __Take heed_ look well to thy own spirit_ and regard not iniquity_ return not to it (so some)_ for it is at thy peril if thou do.__ Let us never dare to think a favourable thought of sin_ never indulge it_ nor allow ourselves in it. Elihu thinks Job had need of this caution_ he having chosen iniquity rather than affliction_ that is_ having chosen rather to gratify his own pride and humour in contending with God than to mortify it by a submission to him and accepting the punishment. We may take it more generally_ and observe that those who choose iniquity rather than affliction make a very foolish choice. Those that ease their cares by sinful pleasures_ increase their wealth by sinful pursuits_ escape their troubles by sinful projects_ and evade sufferings for righteousness' sake by sinful compliances against their consciences_ make a choice they will repent of; for there is more evil in the least sin than in the greatest affliction. It is an evil_ and only evil.,20250223
3. Let him repeat_ if he can_ the songs of praise which were sung at that solemnity (v. when the morning-stars sang together_ the blessed angels (the first-born of the Father of light)_ who_ in the morning of time_ shone as brightly as the morning star_ going immediately before the light which God commanded to shine out of darkness upon the seeds of this lower world_ the earth_ which was without form and void. They were the sons of God_ who shouted for joy when they saw the foundations of the earth laid_ because_ though it was not made for them_ but for the children of men_ and though it would increase their work and service_ yet they knew that the eternal Wisdom and Word_ whom they were to worship (Heb. i. would rejoice in the habitable parts of the earth_ and that much of his delight would be in the sons of men_ Prov. viii,20250223
3. Let them know what will be the consequence of their choosing or refusing this fair offer_ v.,20250223
3. Of slothfulness and diligence_ ch. x. 4_ 26; xii. 11_ 24_ 27; xiii. 4_ 23; xv. 19; xvi. 26; xviii. 9;,20250223
3. She anticipated the objection which he might make of the danger of it. Is she not another man's wife_ and what if her husband should catch them in adultery_ in the very act? he will make them pay dearly for their sport_ and where will the solace of their love be then? __Never fear___ says she_ __the good man is not at home__ (v. 19); she does not call him her husband_ for she forsakes the guide of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; but __the good man of the house_ whom I am weary of.__ Thus Potiphar's wife_ when she spoke of her husband_ would not call him so_ but he_ Gen. xxxix,20250223
3. She concludes with a full assurance both of faith and hope_ and so gets the mastery of her trouble. ,20250223
3. She gets the good word of all her neighbours_ as Ruth did_ whom all the city of her people knew to be a virtuous woman_ Ruth iii,20250223
3. She is one that makes what she does to turn to a good account_ by her prudent management of it. She does not toil all night and catch nothing; no_ she herself perceives that her merchandise is good (v. 18); she is sensible that in all her labour there is profit_ and that encourages her to go on in it. She perceives that she can make things herself better and cheaper than she can buy them; she finds by observation what branch of her employment brings in the best returns_ and to that she applies herself most closely. ,20250223
3. Some will object the many discouragements they have met with in their charity. They have been reproached for it as proud and pharisaical; they have but little to give_ and they shall be despised if they do not give as others do; they know not but their children may come to want it_ and they had better lay it up for them; they have taxes to pay and purchases to make; they know not what use will be made of their charity_ nor what construction will be put upon it; these_ and a hundred such objections_ he answers_ in one word (v. 4): He that observes the wind shall not sow_ which signifies doing good; and he that regards the clouds shall not reap_ which signifies getting good. If we stand thus magnifying every little difficulty and making the worst of it_ starting objections and fancying hardship and danger where there is none_ we shall never go on_ much less go through with our work_ nor make any thing of it. If the husbandman should decline_ or leave off_ sowing for the sake of every flying cloud_ and reaping for the sake of every blast of wind_ he would make but an ill account of his husbandry at the year's end. The duties of religion are as necessary as sowing and reaping_ and will turn as much to our own advantage. The discouragements we meet with in these duties are but as winds and clouds_ which will do us no harm_ and which those that put on a little courage and resolution will despise and easily break through. Note_ Those that will be deterred and driven off by small and seeming difficulties from great and real duties will never bring any thing to pass in religion_ for there will always arise some wind_ some cloud or other_ at least in our imagination_ to discourage us. Winds and clouds are in God's hands_ are designed to try us_ and our Christianity obliges us to endure hardness.,20250223
3. That he should be a blessing to his country and an instrument of good to many (v. 30): God shall_ in answer to thy prayers_ deliver the island of the innocent_ and have a regard therein to the pureness of thy hands_ which is necessary to the acceptableness of our prayers_ 1 Tim. ii,20250223
3. That he was resolved to speak_ with all possible freedom and sincerity_ what he thought was true_ not what he thought would please (v. 21_ 22): __Let me not accept any man's person_ as partial judges do_ that aim to enrich themselves_ not to do justice. I am resolved to flatter no man.__ He would not speak otherwise than he thought_ either_ ,20250223
3. That it was requisite for something to be said_ for the setting of this controversy in a true light_ which_ by all that had hitherto been said_ was but rendered more intricate and perplexed (v.,20250223
3. That we may not bring the sacrifice of fools_ we must come to God's house with hearts disposed to know and do our duty. We must be ready to hear_ that is_ ,20250223
3. The aggravation of this sin: Yet he had filled their houses with good things_ v,20250223
3. The agreeableness of these things to us_ in respect both of comfort and credit. ,20250223
3. The hypocrite is here compared to a flourishing and well-rooted tree_ which_ though it do not wither of itself_ yet will easily be cut down and its place no it no more. The secure and prosperous sinner may think himself wronged when he is compared to a rush and a flag; he thinks he has a better root. __We will allow him his conceit___ says Bildad_ __and give him all the advantage he can desire_ and bring him in suddenly cut off.__ He is here represented as Nebuchadnezzar was in his own dream (Dan. iv. 10) by a great tree. ,20250223
3. The lesson that is to be learned. In general_ learn wisdom_ consider_ and be wise; that is the thing we are to aim at in all our learning_ not only to be knowing_ but to be wise. In particular_ learn to provide meat in summer; that is_ ,20250223
3. The more men have the more care they have about it_ which perplexes them and disturbs their repose_ v,20250223
3. The profit of good husbandry in a family: __Keep thy sheep_ and thy sheep will help to keep thee; thou shalt have food for thy children and servants_ goats' milk enough (v. 27); and enough is as good as a feast. Thou shalt have raiment likewise: the lambs' wool shall be for thy clothing. Thou shalt have money to pay thy rent; the goats thou shalt have to sell shall be the price of thy field;__ nay_ as some understand it_ __Thou shalt become a purchaser_ and buy land to leave to thy children___ (v. 26). Note_ ,20250223
3. The spouse takes this occasion to acknowledge with thankfulness his kindness to her_ v,20250223
3. There is a cradle too provided for this babe: I broke up for it my decreed place_ v,20250223
3. They are proud and unhumbled under their afflictions_ which were sent to mortify them and to hide pride from them (v. 12): There they cry—there they lie exclaiming against their oppressors_ and filling the ears of all about them with their complaints_ not sparing to reflect upon God himself and his providence—but none gives answer. God does not work deliverance for them_ and perhaps men do not much regard them; and why so? It is because of the pride of evil men; they are evil men; they regard iniquity in their hearts_ and therefore God will not hear their prayers_ Ps. lxvi. 18; Isa. i,20250223
3. They expressed the greatest scorn and indignation against him. They spat in his face_ or were ready to do so; they tripped up his heels_ pushed away his feet (v. kicked him_ either in wrath_ because they hated him_ or in sport_ to make themselves merry with him_ as they did with their companions at foot-ball. The best of saints have sometimes received the worst of injuries and indignities from a spiteful_ scornful_ wicked world_ and must not think it strange; our Master himself was thus abused.,20250223
3. They shall be happy in the wealth of the world_ or in that which is infinitely better. ,20250223
3. To enforce this petition_ she pleads the power of love_ of her love to him_ which constrained her to be thus pressing for the tokens of his love to her.,20250223
3. To their own second and sober thoughts (v. 29): __Return_ I pray you_ consider the thing over again without prejudice and partiality_ and let not the result be iniquity_ let it not be an unrighteous sentence; and you will find my righteousness is in it___ that is_ __I am in the right in this matter; and_ though I cannot keep my temper as I should_ I keep my integrity_ and have not said_ nor done_ nor suffered_ any thing which will prove me other than an honest man.__ A just cause desires nothing more than a just hearing_ and if need be a re-hearing.,20250223
3. Violence and oppression_ and injustice in his poor neighbours_ v,20250223
3. Waters_ in scripture_ are put for multitudes (Rev. xvi. and there are multitudes of poor (we do not want objects of charity); waters are put also for mourners: the poor are men of sorrows. Thou must give bread_ the necessary supports of life_ not only give good words but good things_ Isa. lviii,20250223
3. We must be willing to take pains (v. 4); we must seek it as silver_ preferring it far before all the wealth of this world_ and labouring in search of it as those who dig in the mines_ who undergo great toil and run great hazards_ with indefatigable industry and invincible constancy and resolution_ in pursuit of the ore; or as those who will be rich rise up early_ and sit up late_ and turn every stone to get money and fill their treasures. Thus diligent must we be in the use of the means of knowledge_ following on to know the Lord.,20250223
3. We must govern our passion with wisdom and grace (v. 9): Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; those that are hasty in their expectations_ and cannot brook delays_ are apt to be angry if they be not immediately gratified. __Be not angry at proud oppressors_ or any that are the instruments of your trouble.__ ,20250223
3. We must lay hold on it as we lay hold on a good bargain when it is offered to us_ which we do the more carefully if there be danger of having it taken out of our hands. We must apprehend with all our might_ and put forth our utmost vigour in the pursuit of it_ lay hold on all occasions to improve in it_ and catch at the least of its dictates.,20250223
3. We must not be offended at the greatest prosperity of wicked people_ nor at the saddest calamities that may befal the godly in this life_ v,20250223
3. We must retain the word of God and the good instructions which our parents gave us out of it. ,20250223
3. What he suspected to be the true cause of it_ and that was_ in short_ this: they were themselves rich and at ease_ and therefore they despised him who had fallen into poverty. It is the way of the world; we see instances of it daily. Those that prosper are praised_ but of those that are going down it is said_ __Down with them.__ He that is ready to slip with his feet and fall into trouble_ though he has formerly shone as a lamp_ is then looked upon as a lamp going out like the snuff of a candle_ which we throw to the ground and tread upon_ and is accordingly despised in the thought of him that is at ease_ v,20250223
3. What reason they had to learn those things which he was about to teach them (v. that it was confirmed by their own observation—You yourselves have seen it (but what we have heard_ and seen and known_ we have need to be taught_ that we may be perfect in our lesson)_ and that it would set them to rights in their judgment concerning him—__Why then are you thus altogether vain_ to condemn me for a wicked man because I am afflicted?__ Truth_ rightly understood and applied_ would cure us of that vanity of mind which arises from our mistakes. That particularly which he offers now to lay before them is the portion of a wicked man with God_ particularly of oppressors_,20250223
30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.,20250223
30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.,20250223
30 I went by the field of the slothful_ and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; 31 And_ lo_ it was all grown over with thorns_ and nettles had covered the face thereof_ and the stone wall thereof was broken down. 32 Then I saw_ and considered it well: I looked upon it_ and received instruction. 33 Yet a little sleep_ a little slumber_ a little folding of the hands to sleep: 34 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.,20250223
30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.,20250223
30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.,20250223
30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat.,20250223
30 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord. 31 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the Lord.,20250223
30. __You hear what I have to say: Is there iniquity in my tongue? that iniquity that you charge me with? Have I blasphemed God or renounced him? Are not my present arguings right? Do not you perceive_ by what I say_ that I can discern perverse things? I can discover your fallacies and mistakes_ and_ if I were myself in an error_ I could perceive it.

31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.,20250223
31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God_ I have borne chastisement_ I will not offend any more: 32 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity_ I will do no more. 33 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it_ whether thou refuse_ or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. 34 Let men of understanding tell me_ and let a wise man hearken unto me. 35 Job hath spoken without knowledge_ and his words were without wisdom. 36 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. 37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin_ he clappeth his hands among us_ and multiplieth his words against God.,20250223

31 The hoary head is a crown of glory_ if it be found in the way of righteousness.,20250223
31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out. 32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.,20250223

31. When he pleases by them he judges the people he is angry with. Storms_ and tempests_ and excessive rains_ destroying the fruits of the earth and causing inundations_ come from the clouds; but_ on the other hand_ from them_ usually_ he gives meat in abundance; they drop fatness upon the pastures that are clothed with flocks_ and the valleys that are covered with corn_ Ps. lxv. 11-13. ,20250223
32 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.,20250223
32 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.,20250223
32 Now therefore hearken unto me_ O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways. 33 Hear instruction_ and be wise_ and refuse it not. 34 Blessed is the man that heareth me_ watching daily at my gates_ waiting at the posts of my doors. 35 For whoso findeth me findeth life_ and shall obtain favour of the Lord. 36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.,20250223

33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam_ by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: 34 Did I fear a great multitude_ or did the contempt of families terrify me_ that I kept silence_ and went not out of the door? 35 Oh that one would hear me! behold_ my desire is_ that the Almighty would answer me_ and that mine adversary had written a book. 36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder_ and bind it as a crown to me. 37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. 38 If my land cry against me_ or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; 39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money_ or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat_ and cockle instead of barley.

By them we may teach ourselves; let them but come with pungency and power to the soul_ let the impressions of them be deep and durable_ and the will make us wise to salvation. ,20250223
35 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.,20250223
35)_ Who hath first given to God_ let him prove it_ and it shall be recompensed to him again. Why should we demand it_ as a just debt_ to gain by our religion (as Job seemed to do)_ when the God we serve does not gain by it? 1.

36. The souls of men are nobler and more excellent beings than the stars of heaven themselves_ and shine more brightly. The powers and faculties of reason with which man is endued_ and the wonderful performances of thought_ bring him into some alliance to the blessed angels; and whence comes this light_ but from the Father of lights? Who else has put wisdom into the inner parts of man_ and given understanding to the heart? 1. The rational soul itself_ and its capacities_ come from him as the God of nature; for he forms the spirit of man within him. We did not make our own souls_ nor can we describe how they act_ nor how they are united to our bodies. He only that made them knows them_ and knows how to manage them. He fashioneth men's hearts alike in some things_ and yet unlike in others,20250223

4 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.,20250223
4 Again_ I considered all travail_ and every right work_ that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit,20250223
4 An high look_ and a proud heart_ and the plowing of the wicked_ is sin.,20250223
4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses_ every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them,20250223

4 Wrath is cruel_ and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?,20250223
4)_ for we shall but weary ourselves for it_ Heb. ii,20250223
4)_ he did not repent of that_ but reflected on it with pleasure_ yet mentions it not_ lest he should seem to reflect on it with pride; but he here sends those to it that would know more of the vanity of the world and would find that happiness which is in vain sought for in the creature. David_ when he was perplexed_ went into the sanctuary of God_ Ps. lxxiii,20250223
4)_ the words of his mouth (v. his sayings (v. all the good lessons he had taught him; and perhaps he means particularly the book of Psalms_ many of which were Maschils—psalms of instruction_ and two of them are expressly said to be for Solomon. These_ and all his other words_ Solomon must have an eye to. First_ He must hear and receive them (v. diligently attend to them_ and imbibe them_ as the earth drinks in the rain that comes often upon it_ Heb. vi,20250223
4): Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? But does it therefore follow that Job is a hypocrite_ and a wicked man_ which is all that he denied? By no means. Though man_ as born of a woman_ is not clean_ yet_ as born again of the Spirit_ he is clean,20250223
4); they see her_ and bless her. The angels in heaven_ and all her friends on earth_ are the joyful spectators of her bliss. The Jewish church came up from the wilderness supported by the divine power and favour_ Deut. xxxii. 10_ 11. The Christian church was raised up from a low and desolate condition by the grace of Christ relied on_ Gal. iv,20250223

4. A comfortable prospect of their future peace. This Zophar here thinks to please Job with_ in answer to the many despairing expressions he had used_ as if it were to no purpose for him to hope ever to see good days again in this world: __Yea_ but thou mayest__ (says Zophar) __and good nights too.__ A blessed change he here puts him in hopes of.,20250223
4. By her place_ not her own house; she hates the confinement and employment of that; her feet abide not there any longer than needs must. She is all for gadding abroad_ changing place and company. Now is she without in the country_ under pretence of taking the air_ now in the streets of the city_ under pretence of seeing how the market goes. She is here_ and there_ and every where but where she should be. She lies in wait at every corner_ to pick up such as she can make a prey of. Virtue is a penance to those to whom home is a prison.,20250223
4. For her encouragement_ he tells her the good thoughts he had of her_ whatever she thought of herself: Sweet is thy voice; thy praying voice_ though thou canst but chatter like a crane or a swallow (Isa. xxxviii. 14); it is music in God's ears. He has assured us that the prayer of the upright is his delight; he smelled a sweet savour from Noah's sacrifice_ and the spiritual sacrifices are no less acceptable_ 1 Pet. ii,20250223
4. From what he had observed of the great good which one wise and virtuous man may do he infers what a great deal of mischief one wicked man may do_ and what a great deal of good he may be the hindrance of: One sinner destroyeth much good. ,20250223
4. God has an uncontrollable dominion in all the affairs of the children of men_ and so guides and governs whatever concerns both communities and particular persons_ that_ as what he designs cannot be defeated_ so what he does cannot be changed_ v,20250223
4. He concludes with an assurance of safety and happiness to all those that submit to the instructions of wisdom ( v. 33): __Whoso hearkeneth unto me_ and will be ruled by me_ he shall___,20250223
4. He foresaw such an end of all these things as would be sufficient to keep us from quarrelling with the divine Providence upon account of them. He supposes a wicked ruler to do an unjust thing a hundred times_ and that yet his punishment is deferred_ and God's patience towards him is prolonged_ much beyond what was expected_ and the days of his power are lengthened out_ so that he continues to oppress; yet he intimates that we should not be discouraged. ,20250223
4. He increased his family. When he proposed to himself to do great works he must employ many hands_ and therefore procured servants and maidens_ which were bought with his money_ and of those he had servants born in his house_ v,20250223
4. He is given up for gone_ and his life despaired of (v. 22): His soul draws near to the grave_ that is_ he has all the symptoms of death upon him_ and in the apprehension of all about him_ as well as in his own_ he is a dying man. The pangs of death_ here called the destroyers_ are just ready to seize him; they compass him about_ Ps. cxvi,20250223
4. He offered sacrifice for them_ both to atone for the sins he feared they had been guilty of in the days of their feasting and to implore for them mercy to pardon and grace to prevent the debauching of their minds and corrupting of their manners by the liberty they had taken_ and to preserve their piety and purity.,20250223
4. He retaliates upon them (Ps. xviii. 26); he resists the proud. ,20250223
4. He shall be dispossessed of his estate; that shall sink and dwindle away to nothing_ so that he shall not rejoice therein_ v,20250223
4. He took a great deal of pains and care to do good_ designing to teach the people knowledge. He did not put them off with any thing that came next to hand_ because they were inferior people_ and he a very wise man_ but considering the worth of the souls he preached to and the weight of the subject he preached on_ he gave good heed to what he read and heard from others_ that_ having stocked himself well_ he might bring out of his treasury things new and old. He gave good heed to what he spoke and wrote himself_ and was choice and exact in it; all he did was elaborate. ,20250223
4. He valued himself by the check he gave to the violence of proud and evil men (v. 17): I broke the jaws of the wicked. He does not say that he broke their necks. He did not take away their lives_ but he broke their jaws_ he took away their power of doing mischief; he humbled them_ mortified them_ and curbed their insolence_ and so plucked the spoil out of their teeth_ delivered the persons and estates of honest men from being made a prey of by them. When they had got the spoil between their teeth_ and were greedily swallowing it down_ he bravely rescued it_ as David did the lamb out of the mouth of the lion_ not fearing_ though they roared and raged like a lion disappointed of his prey. Good magistrates must thus be a terror and restraint to evil-doers and a protection to the innocent_ and_ in order to this_ they have need to arm themselves with zeal_ and resolution_ and an undaunted courage. A judge upon the bench has as much need to be bold and brave as a commander in the field.,20250223
4. His dearest and most valuable possessions were his ten children; and_ to conclude the tragedy_ news if brought him_ at the same time_ that they were killed and buried in the ruins of the house in which they were feasting_ and all the servants that waited on them_ except one that came express with the tidings of it_ v. 18_ 19. This was the greatest of Job's losses_ and which could not but go nearest him; and therefore the devil reserved it for the last_ that_ if the other provocations failed_ this might make him curse God. Our children are pieces of ourselves; it is very hard to part with them_ and touches a good man in as tender a part as any. But to part with them all at once_ and for them to be all cut off in a moment_ who had been so many years his cares and hopes_ went to the quick indeed. ,20250223
4. His life was hastening apace towards a period_ v,20250223
4. If God give us himself to be our joy_ he will deny us nothing that is good for us. __Now_ God is a terror to thee; he is so by thy own confession (ch. vi. 4; xvi. 9; xix. 11); but_ if thou wilt return to him_ then_ and not till then_ he will be thy delight; and it shall be as much a pleasure to thee to think of him as ever it was a pain.__ No delight is comparable to the delight which gracious souls have in the Almighty; and those that acquaint themselves with him_ and submit themselves entirely to him_ shall find his favour to be_ not only their strength_ but their song.,20250223
4. If he laugh at the trial of the innocent (ch. ix. if he be so difficult of access (ch. ix. who will pray to him?__ Note_ It is a piece of injustice which even wise and good men are too often guilty of_ in the heat of disputation_ to charge upon their adversaries those consequences of their opinions which are not fairly drawn from them and which really they abhor. This is not doing as we would be done by.,20250223
4. If the affliction do not do its work_ let them expect the furnace to be heated seven times hotter till they are consumed (v. 12): If they obey not_ if they are not bettered by their afflictions_ are not reclaimed and reformed_ they shall perish by the sword of God's wrath. Those whom his rod does not cure his sword will kill; and the consuming fire will prevail if the refining fire do not; for when God judges he will overcome. If Ahaz_ in his distress_ trespass yet more against the Lord_ this is that king Ahaz that is marked for ruin_ 2 Chron. xxviii. 22; Jer. vi. 29_ 30. God would have instructed them by their afflictions_ but they received not instruction_ would not take the hints that were given them; and therefore they shall die without knowledge_ ere they are aware_ without any further previous notices given them; or they shall die because they were without knowledge notwithstanding the means of knowledge which they were blessed with. Those that die without knowledge die without grace and are undone for ever.,20250223
4. It is a participation of the happiness of God himself_ for wisdom is his everlasting glory and blessedness_ v. 19_ 20. This should make us in love with the wisdom and understanding which God gives_ that the Lord by wisdom founded the earth_ so that it cannot be removed_ nor can ever fail of answering all the ends of its creation_ to which it is admirably and unexceptionably fitted. By understanding he has likewise established the heavens and directed all the motions of them in the best manner. The heavenly bodies are vast_ yet there is no flaw in them—numerous_ yet no disorder in them—the motion rapid_ yet no wear or tear; the depths of the sea are broken up_ and thence come the waters beneath the firmament_ and the clouds drop down the dews_ the waters from above the firmament_ and all this by the divine wisdom and knowledge; therefore happy is the man that finds wisdom_ for he will thereby be thoroughly furnished for every good word and work. Christ is that Wisdom_ by whom the worlds were made and still consist; happy therefore are those to whom he is made of God wisdom_ for he has wherewithal to make good all the foregoing promises of long life_ riches_ and honour; for all the wealth of heaven_ earth_ and seas_ is his.,20250223
4. Let him not dare to prescribe to God_ nor give him his measures (v. 22_ 23): __Behold_ God exalteth by his power___ that is_ __He does_ may_ and can set up and pull down whom he pleases_ and therefore it is not for thee nor me to contend with him.__ The more we magnify God the more do we humble and abase ourselves. Now consider_ ,20250223
4. Let him take delight in his children and look upon them with pleasure (v. 16_ 17): __Look upon them as streams from thy own pure fountains__ (the Jews are said to come forth out of the waters of Judah_ Isa. xlviii. 1)_ __so that they are parts of thyself_ as the streams are of the fountain. Keep to thy own wife_ and thou shalt have___ ,20250223
4. Let thy eyes observe my ways; have an eye to the rule of God's word_ the conduct of his providence_ and the good examples of his people. Our eyes must observe these_ as he that writes observes his copy_ that we may keep in the right paths and may proceed and persevere in them.,20250223
4. Repeating the gracious calls he had given her to go along with him a walking_ invited by the pleasures of the returning spring (ver. 10-13)_ out of her obscurity (ver. and the charge he had given to the servants to destroy that which would be hurtful to his vineyard_ ver. 15,20250223
4. Satan_ that roaring lion_ in the prince of this world; in the things of it he lies in wait to devour. On the tops of these mountains there are many dangerous temptations to those who would take up their residence in them; and therefore come with me from them; let us not set our hearts upon the things of this world_ and then they can do us no hurt. Come with me from the temples of idolaters_ and the societies of wicked people (so some understand it); come out from among them_ and be you separate. Come from under the dominion of your own lusts_ which are as lions and leopards_ fierce upon us_ and making us fierce.,20250223
4. She takes care of her family and all the affairs of it_ gives meat to her household (v. to every one his portion of meat in due season_ so that none of her servants have reason to complain of being kept short or faring hard. She gives also a portion (an allotment of work_ as well as meat) to her maidens; they shall all of them know their business and have their task. She looks well to the ways of her household (v. 27); she inspects the manners of all her servants_ that she may check what is amiss among them_ and oblige them all to behave properly and do their duty to God and one another_ as well as to her; as Job_ who put away iniquity far from his tabernacle_ and David_ who would suffer no wicked thing in his house. She does not intermeddle in the concerns of other people's houses; she thinks it enough for her to look well to her own.,20250223
4. Some will say_ __We do not see in which way what we expend in charity should ever be made up to us; we do not find ourselves ever the richer; why should we depend upon the general promise of a blessing on the charitable_ unless we saw which way to expect the operation of it?__ To this he answers_ __Thou knowest not the work of God_ nor is it fit thou shouldst. Thou mayest be sure he will make good his word of promise_ though he does not tell thee how_ or which way_ and though he works in a way by himself_ according to the counsels of his unsearchable wisdom. He will work_ and none shall hinder; but then he will work and none shall direct or prescribe to him. The blessing shall work insensibly but irresistibly. God's work shall certainly agree with his word_ whether we see it or no.__ Our ignorance of the work of God he shows_ in two instances:—,20250223
4. Stinted_ ver. 5_ 14.,20250223
4. That all things in this world are movable and mutable_ and subject to a continual toil and agitation_ constant in nothing but inconstancy_ still going_ never resting; it was but once that the sun stood still; when it is risen it is hastening to set_ and_ when it is set_ hastening to rise again (v. 5); the winds are ever and anon shifting (v. and the waters in a continual circulation (v. it would be of as bad consequence for them to stagnate as for the blood in the body to do so. And can we expect rest in a world where all things are thus full of labour (v. on a sea that is always ebbing and flowing_ and her waves continually working and rolling? 5. That though all things are still in motion_ yet they are still where they were; The sun parts (as it is in the margin)_ but it is to the same place; the wind turns till it comes to the same place_ and so the waters return to the place whence they came. Thus man_ after all the pains he takes to find satisfaction and happiness in the creature_ is but where he was_ still as far to seek as ever. Man's mind is as restless in its pursuits as the sun_ and wind_ and rivers_ but never satisfied_ never contented; the more it has of the world the more it would have; and it would be no sooner filled with the streams of outward prosperity_ the brooks of honey and butter (Job xx. than the sea is with all the rivers that run into it; it is still as it was_ a troubled sea that cannot rest,20250223
4. That he had something new to offer_ and would endeavour to manage the dispute in a better manner than it had hitherto been managed_ v,20250223
4. That he is a very great and greedy drinker_ not of wine or strong drink (to be greedy of that is peculiar to man_ who by his drunkenness makes a beast of himself)_ but of fair water. ,20250223
4. That which afflicted him most of all was that God seemed to be his enemy and to fight against him. It was he that cast him into the mire (v. and seemed to trample on him when he had him there. This cut him to the heart more than any thing else_ ,20250223
4. The advantage designed us by them. The excellent things which God has written to us are not like the commands which the master gives his servant_ which are all intended for the benefit of the master_ but like those which the master gives his scholar_ which are all intended for the benefit of the scholar. These things must be kept by us_ for they are written to us_ ,20250223
4. The advantages which we have of learning this lesson above what the ant has_ which will aggravate our slothfulness and neglect if we idle away our time. She has no guides_ overseers_ and rulers_ but does it of herself_ following the instinct of nature; the more shame for us who do not in like manner follow the dictates of our own reason and conscience_ though besides them we have parents_ masters_ ministers_ magistrates_ to put us in mind of our duty_ to check us for the neglect of it_ to quicken us to it_ to direct us in it_ and to call us to an account about it. The greater helps we have for working out our salvation the more inexcusable shall we be if we neglect it.,20250223
4. The evil of impatience_ fretfulness_ and discontent. When they thus prevail they are unreasonable and absurd_ impious and ungrateful. To indulge them is a slighting and undervaluing of God's favour. How much soever life is embittered_ we must say_ __It was of the Lord's mercies that we died not from the womb_ that we were not consumed.__ Hatred of life is a contradiction to the common sense and sentiments of mankind_ and to our own at any other time. Let discontented people declaim ever so much against life_ they will be loth to part with it when it comes to the point. When the old man in the fable_ being tired with his burden_ threw it down with discontent and called for Death_ and Death came to him and asked him what he would have with him_ he then answered_ __Nothing_ but to help me up with my burden.__,20250223

4. The more men have the more danger they are in both of doing mischief and of having mischief done them (v. 13): There is an evil_ a sore evil_ which Solomon himself had seen under the sun_ in this lower world_ this theatre of sin and woe—riches left for the owners thereof (who have been industrious to hoard them and keep them safely) to their hurt; they would have been better without them. ,20250223
4. They are not sincere_ and upright_ and inward with God_ in their supplications to him_ and therefore he does not hear and answer them (v. 13): God will not hear vanity_ that is_ the hypocritical prayer_ which is a vain prayer_ coming out of feigned lips. It is a vanity to think that God should hear it_ who searches the heart and requires truth in the inward part.,20250223
4. They often prove hurtful and destroying_ ver. 13,20250223
4. They shall be happy in the grace of God now; that shall be their guide in the good way_ v.,20250223
4. They were very malicious against him_ and not only made a jest of him_ but made a prey of him—not only affronted him_ but set themselves to do him all the real mischief they could devise: They raise up against me the ways of their destruction; or (as some read it)_ They cast upon me the cause of their woe; that is_ __They lay the blame of their being driven out upon me;__ and it is common for criminals to hate the judges and laws by which they are punished. But under this pretence_ ,20250223
4. Those that manage their affairs with wisdom and equity_ that are diligent in the use of lawful means for increasing what they have that spare from luxury and spend in charity_ are in a fair way to have their shops_ their warehouses_ their chambers_ filled with all precious and pleasant riches—precious because got by honest labour_ and the substance of a diligent man is precious—pleasant because enjoyed with holy cheerfulness. Some think this is to be understood chiefly of spiritual riches. By knowledge the chambers of the soul are filled with the graces and comforts of the Spirit_ those precious and pleasant riches; for the Spirit_ by enlightening the understanding_ performs all his other operations on the soul. ,20250223
4. To complete his happiness_ he is supposed to live many years_ or rather many days_ for our life is to be reckoned rather by days than years: The days of his years are many_ and so healthful is his constitution_ and so slowly does age creep upon him_ that they are likely to be many more. Nay_ he is supposed to live a thousand years (which no man_ that we know of_ ever did)_ nay_ a thousand years twice told_ a small part of which time_ one would think_ were enough to convince men_ by their own experience_ of the folly both of those that expect to find all good in worldly wealth_ and of those that expect to find any good in it but in using it.,20250223
4. Upon the whole_ therefore_ he concluded that great scholars do but make themselves great mourners; for in much wisdom is much grief_ v,20250223
4. We must be very cautious and considerate in all our approaches and addresses to God (v.,20250223
4. We must make the best of that which is (v. 10): __Take it not for granted that the former days were better than these_ nor enquire what is the cause that they were so_ for therein thou dost not enquire wisely_ since thou enquirest into the reason of the thing before thou art sure that the thing itself is true; and_ besides_ thou art so much a stranger to the times past_ and such an incompetent judge even of the present times_ that thou canst not expect a satisfactory answer to the enquiry_ and therefore thou dost not enquire wisely; nay_ the supposition is a foolish reflection upon the providence of God in the government of the world.__ Note_ ,20250223
4. We must make use of the word of God and of the benefit that is designed us by it. If we bind it continually upon our hearts_ ,20250223
4. We must retain it. It is not enough to lay hold on wisdom_ but we must keep our hold_ hold it fast_ with a resolution never to let it go_ but to persevere in the ways of wisdom to the end. We must sustain it (so some read it)_ must embrace it with all our might_ as we do that which we would sustain. We must do all we can to support the declining interests of religion in the places where we live.,20250223
4. Wisdom will be of use both for caution to saints in their way_ and for a check to sinners in their way. ,20250223
4. Worst of all_ the heart is hardened in the sin_ and the sinner_ notwithstanding all these present mischiefs that attend it_ obstinately persist in it_ and hates to be reformed: When shall I awake? Much ado he has to shake off the chains of his drunken sleep; he can hardly get clear of the fumes of the wine_ though he strives with them_ that (being thirsty in the morning) he may return to it again. So perfectly lost is he to all sense of virtue and honour_ and so wretchedly is his conscience seared_ that he is not ashamed to say_ I will seek it yet again.

45) they perceived some power to rise within them_ and rest upon them_ which urged and enabled them to write or speak far above their own natural ability_ in psalms or hymns_ or in history or in rules of good living_ still enjoying the ordinary vigour and use of their senses. Let David himself describe it. The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me_ and his word was in my tongue; the God of Israel said_ the Rock of Israel spoke to me_ 2 Sam. xxiii. 2_ 3. This gives such a magnificent account of the inspiration by which David wrote that I see not why it should be made inferior to that of the other prophets_ for David is expressly called a prophet_ Acts ii. 29_ 30. But_ since our hand is in with the Jewish masters_ let us see what books they account Hagiographa. These five that are now before us come_ without dispute_ into this rank of sacred writers_ and the book of the Lamentations is not unfitly added to them. Indeed the Jews_ when they would speak critically_ reckon all those songs which we meet with in the Old Testament among the Hagiographa; for though they were penned by prophets_ and under the direction of the Holy Ghost_ yet_ because they were not the proper result of a visum propheticum—prophetic vision_ they were not strictly prophecy. As to the historical books_ they distinguish (but I think it is a distinction without a difference); some of them they assign to the prophets_ calling them the prophetæ priores—the former prophets_ namely_ Joshua_ Judges_ and the two books of the Kings; but others they rank among the Hagiographa_ as the book of Ruth (which yet is but an appendix to the book of Judges)_ the two books of Chronicles_ with Ezra_ Nehemiah_ and the book of Esther_ which last the rabbin have a great value for_ and think it is to be had in equal esteem with the law of Moses itself_ that it shall last as long as that lasts_ and shall survive the writings of the Prophets. And_ lastly_ they reckon the book of Daniel among the Hagiographa_2 for which no reason can be given_ since he was not inferior to any of the prophets in the gift of prophecy; and therefore the learned Mr. Smith thinks that their placing him among the Hagiographical writers was fortuitous by mistake.3 Mr. Smith_ in his Discourse before quoted_ though he supposes this kind of divine inspiration to be more __pacate and serene than that which was strictly called prophecy_ not acting so much upon the imagination_ but seating itself in the higher and purer faculties of the soul_ yet shows that it manifested itself to be of a divine nature_ not only as it always elevated pious souls into strains of devotion_ or moved them strangely to dictate matters of true piety and goodness_ but as it came in abruptly upon the minds of those holy men_ and transported them from the temper of mind they were in before_ so that they perceived themselves captivated by the power of some higher light than that which their own understanding commonly poured out upon them; and this_ says he_ was a kind of vital form to that light of divine and sanctified reason which they were perpetually possessed of and that constant frame of holiness and goodness which dwelt in their hallowed minds.__ We have reason to glorify the God of Israel who gave such power unto men and has here transmitted to us the blessed products of that power.,20250223

5 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome_ and cometh to shame.,20250223
5 Behold_ God is mighty_ and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. 6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. 7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea_ he doth establish them for ever_ and they are exalted. 8 And if they be bound in fetters_ and be holden in cords of affliction,20250223
5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.,20250223
5 Dead things are formed from under the waters_ and the inhabitants thereof. 6 Hell is naked before him_ and destruction hath no covering. 7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place_ and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 9 He holdeth back the face of his throne_ and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds_ until the day and night come to an end. 11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 12 He divideth the sea with his power_ and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 14 Lo_ these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?,20250223
5 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord: though hand join in hand_ he shall not be unpunished.,20250223
5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the Lord understand all things.,20250223
5 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.,20250223
5 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? 6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought_ and stripped the naked of their clothing. 7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink_ and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 8 But as for the mighty man_ he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. 9 Thou hast sent widows away empty_ and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 10 Therefore snares are round about thee_ and sudden fear troubleth thee,20250223
5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked_ to overthrow the righteous in judgment.,20250223
5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea_ twice; but I will proceed no further.,20250223
5 Open rebuke is better than secret love. 6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.,20250223
5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. 6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.,20250223
5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.,20250223
5 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.,20250223
5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.,20250223
5 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness_ leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee. 6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart_ as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire_ which hath a most vehement flame. 7 Many waters cannot quench love_ neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love_ it would utterly be contemned.,20250223
5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.,20250223

5. He did not neglect country business_ but both entertained and enriched himself with that_ and was not diverted from it either by his studies or by his pleasures. He had large possessions of great and small cattle_ herds and flocks_ as his father had before him (1 Chron. xxvii. 29_ not forgetting that his father_ in the beginning_ was a keeper of sheep. Let those that deal in cattle neither despise their employment nor be weary of it_ remembering that Solomon puts his having possessions of cattle among his great works and his pleasures.,20250223
5. He expected no other now than that God_ by these troubles_ would shortly make an end of him: __If I be made to ride upon the wind_ I can count upon no other than to break my neck shortly;__ and he speaks as if God had no other design upon him than that in all his dealings with him: __I know that thou wilt bring me_ with so much the more terror_ to death_ though I might have been brought thither without all this ado_ for it is the house appointed for all living___ v,20250223
5. He put what he had to say in such a dress as he thought would be most pleasing: He sought to find out acceptable words_ words of delight (v. 10); he took care that good matter might not be spoiled by a bad style_ and by the ungratefulness and incongruity of the expression. Ministers should study_ not for the big words_ nor the fine words_ but acceptable words_ such as are likely to please men for their good_ to edification_ 1 Cor. x,20250223
5. It added to his comfort to see the brothers so kind to their sisters_ that they sent for them to feast with them; for they were so modest that they would not have gone if they had not been sent for. Those brothers that slight their sisters_ care not for their company_ and have no concern for their comfort_ are ill-bred_ ill-natured_ and very unlike Job's sons. It seems their feast was so sober and decent that their sisters were good company for them at it,20250223
5. Let him then scorn the offer of forbidden pleasures when he is always ravished with the love of a faithful virtuous wife; let him consider what an absurdity it will be for him to be ravished with a strange woman (v. to be in love with a filthy harlot_ and embrace the bosom of a stranger_ which_ if he had any sense of honour or virtue_ he would loathe the thoughts of. __Why wilt thou be so sottish_ such an enemy to thyself_ as to prefer puddle-water_ and that poisoned too and stolen_ before pure living waters out of thy own well?__ Note_ If the dictates of reason may be heard_ the laws of virtue will be obeyed.,20250223

5. Those that did him all this mischief were numerous_ unanimous_ and violent (v. 14): They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters_ when the dam is broken; or_ __They came as soldiers into a broad breach which they have made in the wall of a besieged city_ pouring in upon me with the utmost fury;__ and in this they took a pride and a pleasure: They rolled themselves in the desolation as a man rolls himself in a soft and easy bed_ and they rolled themselves upon him with all the weight of their malice.,20250223
5. Thus he did continually_ and not merely whenever an occasion of this kind recurred; for he that is washed needs to wash his feet_ John xiii,20250223
5. We must be sparing of our words in the presence of God_ that is_ we must be reverent and deliberate_ not talk to God as boldly and carelessly as we do to one another_ not speak what comes uppermost_ not repeat things over and over_ as we do to one another_ that what we say may be understood and remembered and may make impression; no_ when we speak to God we must consider_,20250223
5. Wisdom will direct us in the mean between two extremes_ and keep us always in the way of our duty_ which we shall find a plain and safe way (v. 18): __It is good that thou shouldst take hold of this_ this wisdom_ this care_ not to run thyself into snares. Yea_ also from this withdraw not thy hand; never slacken thy diligence_ nor abate thy resolution to maintain a due decorum_ and a good government of thyself. Take hold of the bridle by which thy head-strong passions must be held in from hurrying thee into one mischief or other_ as the horse and mule that have no understanding; and_ having taken hold of it_ keep thy hold_ and withdraw not thy hand from it_ for_ it thou do_ the liberty that they will take will be as the letting forth of water_ and thou wilt not easily recover thy hold again. Be conscientious_ and yet be cautious_ and to this exercise thyself. Govern thyself steadily by the principles of religion_ and thou shalt find that he that fears God shall come forth out of all those straits and difficulties which those run themselves into that cast off that fear.__ The fear of the Lord is that wisdom which will serve as a clue to extricate us out of the most intricate labyrinths. Honesty is the best policy. Those that truly fear God have but one end to serve_ and therefore act steadily. God has likewise promised to direct those that fear him_ and to order their steps not only in the right way_ but out of every dangerous way_ Ps. xxxvii. 23_ 24.,20250223

6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said_ I am young_ and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid_ and durst not show you mine opinion. 7 I said_ Days should speak_ and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. 10 Therefore I said_ Hearken to me; I also will show mine opinion. 11 Behold_ I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons_ whilst ye searched out what to say. 12 Yea_ I attended unto you_ and_ behold_ there was none of you that convinced Job_ or that answered his words: 13 Lest ye should say_ We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down_ not man. 14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.,20250223
6 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment_ therefore the misery of man is great upon him. 7 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? 8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.,20250223

6 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye_ neither desire thou his dainty meats: 7 For as he thinketh in his heart_ so is he: Eat and drink_ saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee. 8 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up_ and lose thy sweet words.,20250223
6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement_ 7 And beheld among the simple ones_ I discerned among the youths_ a young man void of understanding_ 8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house_ 9 In the twilight_ in the evening_ in the black and dark night: 10 And_ behold_ there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot_ and subtil of heart. 11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 12 Now is she without_ now in the streets_ and lieth in wait at every corner.) 13 So she caught him_ and kissed him_ and with an impudent face said unto him_ 14 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows. 15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee_ diligently to seek thy face_ and I have found thee. 16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry_ with carved works_ with fine linen of Egypt. 17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh_ aloes_ and cinnamon. 18 Come_ let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. 19 For the goodman is not at home_ he is gone a long journey: 20 He hath taken a bag of money with him_ and will come home at the day appointed. 21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield_ with the flattering of her lips she forced him. 22 He goeth after her straightway_ as an ox goeth to the slaughter_ or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 23 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare_ and knoweth not that it is for his life.,20250223
6 For he saith to the snow_ Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain_ and to the great rain of his strength. 7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. 8 Then the beasts go into dens_ and remain in their places. 9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. 10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. 11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: 12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. 13 He causeth it to come_ whether for correction_ or for his land_ or for mercy.,20250223
6 Go to the ant_ thou sluggard; consider her ways_ and be wise: 7 Which having no guide_ overseer_ or ruler_ 8 Provideth her meat in the summer_ and gathereth her food in the harvest. 9 How long wilt thou sleep_ O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? 10 Yet a little sleep_ a little slumber_ a little folding of the hands to sleep: 11 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth_ and thy want as an armed man.,20250223
6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet_ and drinketh damage. 7 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. 8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling_ so is he that giveth honour to a fool. 9 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard_ so is a parable in the mouth of fools.,20250223
6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.,20250223

6 Know now that God hath overthrown me_ and hath compassed me with his net. 7 Behold_ I cry out of wrong_ but I am not heard: I cry aloud_ but there is no judgment.,20250223
6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. 7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words_ yet they are wanting to him.,20250223
6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?,20250223
6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord_ and Satan came also among them. 7 And the Lord said unto Satan_ Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord_ and said_ From going to and fro in the earth_ and from walking up and down in it. 8 And the Lord said unto Satan_ Hast thou considered my servant Job_ that there is none like him in the earth_ a perfect and an upright man_ one that feareth God_ and escheweth evil? 9 Then Satan answered the Lord_ and said_ Doth Job fear God for nought? 10 Hast not thou made a hedge about him_ and about his house_ and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands_ and his substance is increased in the land. 11 But put forth thine hand now_ and touch all that he hath_ and he will curse thee to thy face. 12 And the Lord said unto Satan_ Behold_ all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.,20250223
6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king_ and stand not in the place of great men: 7 For better it is that it be said unto thee_ Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.,20250223
6 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.,20250223
6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.,20250223
6 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle_ and his candle shall be put out with him. 7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened_ and his own counsel shall cast him down. 8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet_ and he walketh upon a snare. 9 The gin shall take him by the heel_ and the robber shall prevail against him. 10 The snare is laid for him in the ground_ and a trap for him in the way.,20250223
6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper_ and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. 7 But ask now the beasts_ and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air_ and they shall tell thee: 8 Or speak to the earth_ and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. 9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? 10 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing_ and the breath of all mankind. 11 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?,20250223
6 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.,20250223
6 Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind_ and said_ 7 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee_ and declare thou unto me. 8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me_ that thou mayest be righteous? 9 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 10 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. 11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud_ and abase him. 12 Look on every one that is proud_ and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. 13 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. 14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.,20250223
6 Though I speak_ my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear_ what am I eased? 7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. 8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles_ which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. 9 He teareth me in his wrath_ who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me. 11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly_ and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. 12 I was at ease_ but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck_ and shaken me to pieces_ and set me up for his mark. 13 His archers compass me round about_ he cleaveth my reins asunder_ and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. 14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach_ he runneth upon me like a giant. 15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin_ and defiled my horn in the dust. 16 My face is foul with weeping_ and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;,20250223
6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old_ he will not depart from it.,20250223
6 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke_ perfumed with myrrh and frankincense_ with all powders of the merchant?,20250223
6): Yea_ the light of the wicked shall be put out. Even his light_ the best and brightest part of him_ shall be put out; even that which he rejoiced in shall fail him. Or the yea may refer to Job's complaints of the great distress he was in and the darkness he should shortly make his bed in. __Yea___ says Bildad_ __So it is; thou art clouded_ and straitened_ and made miserable_ and no better could be expected; for the light of the wicked shall be put out_ and therefore thine shall.__ Observe here,20250223

6. Eliphaz would have Job to mark the old way which wicked men have trodden (v. 15) and see what came of it_ what the end of their way was. Note_ There is an old way which wicked men have trodden. Religion had but newly entered when sin immediately followed it. But though it is an old way_ a broad way_ a tracked way_ it is a dangerous way and it leads to destruction; and it is good for us to mark it_ that we may not dare to walk in it. Eliphaz here puts Job in mind of it_ perhaps in opposition to what he had said of the prosperity of the wicked; as if he had said_ __Thou canst find out here and there a single instance_ it may be_ of a wicked man ending his days in peace; but what is that to those two great instances of the final perdition of ungodly men—the drowning of the whole world and the burning of Sodom?__ destructions by wholesale_ in which he thinks Job may_ as in a glass_ see his own face. Observe,20250223
6. He grew very rich_ and was not at all impoverished by his building and gardening_ as many are_ who_ for that reason only_ repent it_ and call it vanity and vexation. Solomon scattered and yet increased. He filled his exchequer with silver and gold_ which yet did not stagnate there_ but were made to circulate through his kingdom_ so that he made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones (1 Kings,20250223
6. His overruling providence_ ver. 29_ 30.,20250223
6. How much soever men have when they die_ they must leave it all behind them (v. 15_ 16): As he came forth of his mother's womb naked_ so shall he return; only as his friends_ when he came naked into the world_ in pity to him_ helped him with swaddling-clothes_ so_ when he goes out_ they help him with grave-clothes_ and that is all. See Job i. 21; Ps. xlix,20250223
6. She is discreet and obliging in all her discourse_ not talkative_ censorious_ nor peevish_ as some are_ that know how to take pains; no_ she opens her mouth with wisdom; when she does speak_ it is with a great deal of prudence and very much to the purpose; you may perceive by every word she says how much she governs herself by the rules of wisdom. She not only takes prudent measures herself_ but gives prudent advice to others; and this not as assuming the authority of a dictator_ but with the affection of a friend and an obliging air: In her tongue is the law of kindness; all she says is under the government of that law. The law of love and kindness is written in the heart_ but it shows itself in the tongue; if we are kindly affectioned one to another_ it will appear by affectionate expression. It is called a law of kindness_ because it gives law to others_ to all she converses with. Her wisdom and kindness together put a commanding power into all she says; they command respect_ they command compliance. How forcible are right words! In her tongue is the law of grace_ or mercy (so some read it)_ understanding it of the word and law of God_ which she delights to talk of among her children and servants. She is full of pious religious discourse_ and manages it prudently_ which shows how full her heart is of another world even when her hands are most busy about this world.,20250223
6. That which he wrote for our instruction is of unquestionable certainty_ and what we may rely upon: That which was written was upright and sincere_ according to the real sentiments of the penman_ even words of truth_ the exact representation of the thing as it is. Those are sure not to miss their way who are guided by these words. What good will acceptable words do us if they be not upright and words of truth? Most are for smooth things_ that flatter them_ rather than right things_ that direct them (Isa. xxx. but to those that understand themselves_ and their own interest_ words of truth will always be acceptable words.,20250223
6. The neck_ which before was compared to the tower of David (ch. iv. is here compared to a tower of ivory_ so white_ so precious; such is the faith of the saints_ by which they are joined to Christ their head.

7 All the labour of man is for his mouth_ and yet the appetite is not filled. 8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor_ that knoweth to walk before the living? 9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit. 10 That which hath been is named already_ and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.,20250223
7 And it was so_ that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job_ the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite_ My wrath is kindled against thee_ and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right_ as my servant Job hath. 8 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams_ and go to my servant Job_ and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly_ in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right_ like my servant Job. 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went_ and did according as the Lord commanded them: the Lord also accepted Job.,20250223
7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord_ and depart from evil. 8 It shall be health to thy navel_ and marrow to thy bones. 9 Honour the Lord with thy substance_ and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: 10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty_ and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. 11 My son_ despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction: 12 For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.,20250223
7 Behold his bed_ which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it_ of the valiant of Israel. 8 They all hold swords_ being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night. 9 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon. 10 He made the pillars thereof of silver_ the bottom thereof of gold_ the covering of it of purple_ the midst thereof being paved with love_ for the daughters of Jerusalem. 11 Go forth_ O ye daughters of Zion_ and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals_ and in the day of the gladness of his heart.,20250223
7 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 8 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 9 The measure thereof is longer than the earth_ and broader than the sea. 10 If he cut off_ and shut up_ or gather together_ then who can hinder him? 11 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it? 12 For vain man would be wise_ though man be born like a wild ass's colt.,20250223
7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.,20250223
7 For there is hope of a tree_ if it be cut down_ that it will sprout again_ and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. 8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth_ and the stock thereof die in the ground,20250223
7 Go from the presence of a foolish man_ when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.,20250223
7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked_ and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. 8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite_ though he hath gained_ when God taketh away his soul? 9 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? 10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?,20250223
7 Lo_ let that night be solitary_ let no joyful voice come therein. 8 Let them curse it that curse the day_ who are ready to raise up their mourning. 9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light_ but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 10 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb_ nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.,20250223
7 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good. 8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me_ and I am not. 9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. 10 He shall return no more to his house_ neither shall his place know him any more. 11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 12 Am I a sea_ or a whale_ that thou settest a watch over me?,20250223
7 Remember_ I pray thee_ who ever perished_ being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? 8 Even as I have seen_ they that plow iniquity_ and sow wickedness_ reap the same. 9 By the blast of God they perish_ and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. 10 The roaring of the lion_ and the voice of the fierce lion_ and the teeth of the young lions_ are broken. 11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey_ and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.,20250223
7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord_ and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. 8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. 9 Then said his wife unto him_ Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God_ and die. 10 But he said unto her_ Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God_ and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.,20250223
7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. 8 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. 9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. 10 Say not thou_ What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.,20250223
7 Tell me_ O thou whom my soul loveth_ where thou feedest_ where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? 8 If thou know not_ O thou fairest among women_ go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock_ and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents. 9 I have compared thee_ O my love_ to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots. 10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels_ thy neck with chains of gold. 11 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.,20250223
7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 My son_ hear the instruction of thy father_ and forsake not the law of thy mother: 9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head_ and chains about thy neck.,20250223

7 The rich ruleth over the poor_ and the borrower is servant to the lender.,20250223
7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.,20250223
7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.,20250223
7 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.,20250223
7 The wicked are overthrown_ and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.,20250223
7 Then I returned_ and I saw vanity under the sun. 8 There is one alone_ and there is not a second; yea_ he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he_ For whom do I labour_ and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity_ yea_ it is a sore travail. 9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 10 For if they fall_ the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. 11 Again_ if two lie together_ then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? 12 And if one prevail against him_ two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.,20250223
7 There is that maketh himself rich_ yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor_ yet hath great riches.,20250223
7 Truly the light is sweet_ and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun: 8 But if a man live many years_ and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. 9 Rejoice_ O young man_ in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth_ and walk in the ways of thine heart_ and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou_ that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. 10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart_ and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.,20250223
7 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: 8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: 9 Lest I be full_ and deny thee_ and say_ Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor_ and steal_ and take the name of my God in vain.,20250223
7 When I went out to the gate through the city_ when I prepared my seat in the street! 8 The young men saw me_ and hid themselves: and the aged arose_ and stood up. 9 The princes refrained talking_ and laid their hand on their mouth. 10 The nobles held their peace_ and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. 11 When the ear heard me_ then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me_ it gave witness to me: 12 Because I delivered the poor that cried_ and the fatherless_ and him that had none to help him. 13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 14 I put on righteousness_ and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. 15 I was eyes to the blind_ and feet was I to the lame. 16 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. 17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked_ and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.,20250223
7 When a man's ways please the Lord_ he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.,20250223
7 When a wicked man dieth_ his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.,20250223
7 Wherefore do the wicked live_ become old_ yea_ are mighty in power? 8 Their seed is established in their sight with them_ and their offspring before their eyes. 9 Their houses are safe from fear_ neither is the rod of God upon them. 10 Their bull gendereth_ and faileth not; their cow calveth_ and casteth not her calf. 11 They send forth their little ones like a flock_ and their children dance. 12 They take the timbrel and harp_ and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 13 They spend their days in wealth_ and in a moment go down to the grave.,20250223
7 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.,20250223
7 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. 8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. 9 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men.,20250223
7)_ and forms the spirit of every man within him. When the fire consumes the wood the flame ascends_ and the ashes return to the earth out of which the wood grew. The soul does not die with the body; it is redeemed from the power of the grave (Ps. xlix. 15); it can subsist without it and will in a state of separation from it_ as the candle burns_ and burns brighter_ when it is taken out of the dark lantern. It removes to the world of spirits_ to which it is allied. It goes to God as a Judge_ to give account of itself_ and to be lodged either with the spirits in prison (1 Pet. iii. 19) or with the spirits in paradise (Luke xxiii. according to what was done in the body. This makes death terrible to the wicked_ whose souls go to God as an avenger_ and comfortable to the godly_ whose souls go to God as a Father_ into whose hands they cheerfully commit them_ through a Mediator_ out of whom sinners may justly dread to think of going to God.,20250223

He had every thing that was charming and diverting_ all sorts of melody and music_ vocal and instrumental_ men-singers and women-singers_ the best voices he could pick up_ and all the wind and band-instruments that were then in use. His father had a genius for music_ but it should seem he employed it more to serve his devotion than the son_ who made it more for his diversion. These are called the delights of the sons of men; for the gratifications of sense are the things that the generality of people set their affections upon and take the greatest complacency in. The delights of the children of God are of quite another nature_ pure_ spiritual_ and heavenly_ and the delights of angels.,20250223

No waters could quench Christ's love to us_ nor any floods drown it; he waded through the greatest difficulties_ even seas of blood. Love sat king upon the floods; let nothing then abate our love to him. ,20250223
7. The vast terraqueous globe neither rests upon any pillars nor hangs upon any axle-tree_ and yet_ by the almighty power of God_ is firmly fixed in its place_ poised with its own weight. The art of man could not hang a feather upon nothing_ yet the divine wisdom hangs the whole earth so. It is ponderibus librata suis—poised by its own weight_ so says the poet; it is upheld by the word of God's power_ so says the apostle. What is hung upon nothing may serve us to set our feet on_ and bear the weight of our bodies_ but it will never serve us to set our hearts on_ nor bear the weight of our souls. ,20250223

9 All this have I seen_ and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. 10 And so I saw the wicked buried_ who had come and gone from the place of the holy_ and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity. 11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily_ therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 12 Though a sinner do evil a hundred times_ and his days be prolonged_ yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God_ which fear before him: 13 But it shall not be well with the wicked_ neither shall he prolong his days_ which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.,20250223

9 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field. 10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity. 11 When goods increase_ they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof_ saving the beholding of them with their eyes? 12 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet_ whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. 13 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun_ namely_ riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. 14 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son_ and there is nothing in his hand. 15 As he came forth of his mother's womb_ naked shall he return to go as he came_ and shall take nothing of his labour_ which he may carry away in his hand. 16 And this also is a sore evil_ that in all points as he came_ so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? 17 All his days also he eateth in darkness_ and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.,20250223

9 What is thy beloved more than another beloved_ O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved_ that thou dost so charge us? 10 My beloved is white and ruddy_ the chiefest among ten thousand. 11 His head is as the most fine gold_ his locks are bushy_ and black as a raven. 12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters_ washed with milk_ and fitly set. 13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices_ as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies_ dropping sweet smelling myrrh. 14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires. 15 His legs are as pillars of marble_ set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon_ excellent as the cedars. 16 His mouth is most sweet: yea_ he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved_ and this is my friend_ O daughters of Jerusalem.,20250223

A catalogue of those things which are in a special manner odious to God_ all which are generally to be found in those men of Belial whom he had described in the foregoing verses; and the last of them (which_ being the seventh_ seems especially to be intended_ because he says they are six_ yea_ seven) is part of his character_ that he sows discord. God hates sin; he hates every sin; he can never be reconciled to it; he hates nothing but sin. But there are some sins which he does in a special manner hate; and all those here mentioned are such as are injurious to our neighbour. It is an evidence of the good-will God bears to mankind that those sins are in a special manner provoking to him which are prejudicial to the comfort of human life and society. Therefore the men of Belial must expect their ruin to come suddenly_ and without remedy_ because their practices are such as the Lord hates and are an abomination to him_ v,20250223
A caution against rash suretiship_ ver. 1-5.,20250223
A caution against wronging servants_ ver. 10.,20250223
A caution to us to keep our temper at all times and under all provocations_ and to take heed of carrying our resentments too far upon any occasion_ especially when there is a king in the case_ against whom there is no rising up_ when it is a ruler_ or one much our superior_ that is offended; nay_ the rule is always the same.,20250223
A charge given to be faithful and constant to our friends_ our old friends_ to keep up an intimacy with them_ and to be ready to do them all the offices that lie in our power. It is good to have a friend_ a bosom-friend_ whom we can be free with_ and with whom we may communicate counsels. It is not necessary that this friend should be a relation_ or any way akin to us_ though it is happiest when_ among those who are so_ we find one fit to make a friend of. Peter and Andrew were brethren_ so were James and John; yet Solomon frequently distinguishes between a friend and a brother. But it is advisable to choose a friend among our neighbours who live near us_ that acquaintance may be kept up and kindnesses the more frequently interchanged. It is good also to have a special respect to those who have been friends to our family: __Thy own friend_ especially if he have been thy father's friend_ forsake not; fail not both to serve him and to use him_ as there is occasion. He is a tried friend; he knows thy affairs; he has a particular concern for thee; therefore be advised by him.__ It is a duty we owe to our parents_ when they are gone_ to love their friends and consult with them. Solomon's son undid himself by forsaking the counsel of his father's friends.,20250223
A charge to all in their places to oppose and prevent the spreading of all such opinions and practices as tend to corrupt men's judgments_ debauch their consciences_ perplex their minds_ and discourage their inclinations to virtue and piety. Persecutors are foxes (Luke xiii. 32); false prophets are foxes_ Eze. xiii,20250223
A charge to particular believers to mortify their own corruptions_ their sinful appetites and passions_ which are as foxes_ little foxes_ that destroy their graces and comforts_ quash good motions_ crush good beginnings_ and prevent their coming to perfection. Seize the little foxes_ the first risings of sin_ the little ones of Babylon (Ps. cxxxvii. those sins that seem little_ for they often prove very dangerous.

A dutiful subjection: Fear the Lord_ and depart from evil; take heed of doing any thing to offend him and to forfeit his care. To fear the Lord_ so as to depart from evil_ is true wisdom and understanding (Job xxviii. 28); those that have it are truly wise_ but self-denyingly so_ and not wise in their own eyes. For our encouragement thus to live in the fear of God it is here promised (v. 8) that it shall be as serviceable even to the outward man as our necessary food. It will be nourishing: It shall be health to thy navel. It will be strengthening: It shall be marrow to thy bones. The prudence_ temperance_ and sobriety_ the calmness and composure of mind_ and the good government of the appetites and passions_ which religion teaches_ tend very much not only to the health of the soul_ but to a good habit of body_ which is very desirable_ and without which our other enjoyments in this world are insipid. Envy is the rottenness of the bones; the sorrow of the world dries them; but hope and joy in God are marrow to them.,20250223
A faithful and lively representation of wisdom's reasonings with the children of men_ and the certain ruin of those who turn a deaf ear to those reasonings_ ver. 20-33.,20250223
A faithful witness commended for an honest man. He that makes conscience of speaking truth_ and representing every thing fairly_ to the best of his knowledge_ whether in judgment or in common conversation_ whether he be upon his oath or no_ he shows forth righteousness; he makes it to appear that he is governed and actuated by the principles and laws of righteousness_ and he promotes justice by doing honour to it and serving the administration of it,20250223
A false witness condemned for a cheat; he shows forth deceit_ not only how little conscience he makes of deceiving those he deals with_ but how much pleasure he takes in it_ and that he is possessed by a lying spirit_ Jer. ix. 3-5. We are all concerned to possess ourselves with a dread and detestation of the sin of lying (Ps. cxix. 163) and with a reigning principle of honesty.,20250223
A flattering lie_ which secretly works the ruin of those it is spoken to. In the former the mischief is plain_ and men guard against it as well as they can_ but in this it is little suspected_ and men betray themselves by being credulous of their own praises and the compliments that are passed upon them. A wise man therefore will be more afraid of a flatterer that kisses and kills than of a slanderer that proclaims war.,20250223
A flowing river_ or a standing lake_,20250223
A fool may have as much worldly wealth_ and may enjoy as much of the pleasure of it_ as a wise man; nay_ and perhaps not be so sensible of the vexation of it: What has the wise more than the fool? v,20250223
A fool may pretend to understanding_ and to seek and intermeddle with the means of it_ but_,20250223
A fool well satisfied with his folly and not seeking the cure of it. While a good man hungers after the solid satisfactions of grace_ a carnal mind feasts on the gratifications of appetite and fancy. Vain mirth and sensual pleasures are its delight_ and with these it can rest contented_ flattering itself in these foolish ways.,20250223
A fool_ a silly_ rude_ boisterous_ vicious man_ who when he has grown rich_ and is partaking of the pleasures of the table_ will disturb all the company with his extravagant talk and the affronts he will put upon those about him,20250223
A foolish son is a great affliction_ and may make a man wish a thousand times he had been written childless. A son that will apply himself to no study or business_ that will take no advice_ that lives a lewd_ loose_ rakish life_ and spends what he has extravagantly_ games it away and wastes it in the excess of riot_ or that is proud_ foppish_ and conceited_ such a one is the grief of his father_ because he is the disgrace_ and is likely to be the ruin_ of his family. He hates all his labour_ when he sees to whom he must leave the fruit of it.,20250223
A fretful_ envious_ discontented spirit_ is its own punishment; it consumes the flesh_ preys upon the animal spirits_ makes the countenance pale_ and is the rottenness of the bones. Those that see the prosperity of others and are grieved_ let them gnash with their teeth and melt away_ Ps. cxii. 10.,20250223
A general exhortation faithfully to adhere to the word of God and to take it for our guide in all our actions.,20250223
A general exhortation to get our minds principled and governed by the world of God_ as a sovereign antidote against this sin_ ver. 1-5.,20250223
A good caution against being intimate with a passionate man. It is the law of friendship that we accommodate ourselves to our friends and be ready to serve them_ and therefore we ought to be wise and wary in the choice of a friend_ that we come not under the sacred tie to any one whom it would be our folly to accommodate ourselves to. Thought we must be civil to all_ yet we must be careful whom we lay in our bosoms and contract a familiarity with. And_ among others_ a man who is easily provoked_ touchy_ and apt to resent affronts_ who_ when he is in a passion_ cares not what he says or does_ but grows outrageous_ such a one is not fit to be made a friend or companion_ for he will be ever and anon angry with us and that will be our trouble_ and he will expect that we should_ like him_ be angry with others_ and that will be our sin,20250223
A good caution against presuming upon time to come: Boast not thyself_ no_ not of to-morrow_ much less of many days or years to come. This does not forbid preparing for to-morrow_ but presuming upon to-morrow. We must not promise ourselves the continuance of our lives and comforts till to-morrow_ but speak of it with submission to the will of God and as those who with good reason are kept at uncertainty about it. We must not take thought for the morrow (Matt. vi.,20250223
A good caution inferred thence_ to take heed of the first spark of contention and to put it out as soon as ever it appears. Dread the breaking of the ice_ for_ if once broken_ it will break further; therefore leave it off_ not only when you see the worst of it_ for then it may be too late_ but when you see the first of it. Obsta principiis—Resist its earliest display. Leave it off even before it be meddled with; leave it off_ if it were possible_ before you begin.,20250223
A good consideration_ upon which this caution is grounded: We know not what a day may bring forth_ what event may be in the teeming womb_ of time; it is a secret till it is born_ Eccl. xi,20250223
A good heart by the tongue becomes very useful. He that has knowledge is not only to enjoy it_ for his own entertainment_ but to use it_ to use it aright_ for the edification of others; and it is the tongue that must make use of it in pious profitable discourse_ in giving suitable and seasonable instructions_ counsels_ and comforts_ with all possible expressions of humility and love_ and then knowledge is used aright; and to him that has_ and thus uses what he has_ more shall be given,20250223
A good king will therefore put those in power who are conscientious_ and will say that which is righteous and discreet_ and know how to speak aright and to the purpose.,20250223
A good man commonly does not himself lay to heart the affronts that are done him so much as his friends do for him. ,20250223
A good man proved to be a wise man by this_ that he governs his tongue well; he that does so the same is a perfect man_ Jam. iii,20250223
A good reason for both of these (v. 18): Surely there is an end_ an end and expectation_ as Jer. xxix,20250223
A good reason for it_ taken from the great advantage of this care and pains with children: When they grow up_ when they grow old_ it is to be hoped_ they will not depart from it. Good impressions made upon them then will abide upon them all their days. Ordinarily the vessel retains the savour with which it was first seasoned. Many indeed have departed from the good way in which they were trained up; Solomon himself did so. But early training may be a means of their recovering themselves_ as it is supposed Solomon did. At least the parents will have the comfort of having done their duty and used the means.,20250223
A good reason given for this care_ because out of it are the issues of life. Out of a heart well kept will flow living issues_ good products_ to the glory of God and the edification of others. Or_ in general_ all the actions of the life flow from the heart_ and therefore keeping that is making the tree good and healing the springs. Our lives will be regular or irregular_ comfortable or uncomfortable_ according as our hearts are kept or neglected.,20250223
A good tongue is healing_ healing to wounded consciences by comforting them_ to sin-sick souls by convincing them_ to peace and love when it is broken by accommodating differences_ compromising matters in variance_ and reconciling parties at variance; this is the healing of the tongue_ which is a tree of life_ the leaves of which have a sanative virtue_ Rev. xxii,20250223
A good understanding those have_ and a better they shall have_ that do his commandments_ Ps. cxi. 10,20250223
A good wife is a great blessing to a family. By a fruitful wife a family is multiplied and replenished with children_ and so built up. But by a prudent wife_ one that is pious_ industrious_ and considerate_ the affairs of the family are made to prosper_ debts are paid_ portions raised_ provision made_ the children well educated and maintained_ and the family has comfort within doors and credit without; thus is the house built. She looks upon it as her own to take care of_ though she knows it is her husband's to bear rule in_ Esth. i. 22,20250223
A good wife is a great blessing to a man. He that finds a wife (that is_ a wife indeed; a bad wife does not deserve to be called by a name of so much honour)_ that finds a help meet for him (that is a wife in the original acceptation of the word)_ that sought such a one with care and prayer and has found what he sought_ he has found a good thing_ a jewel of great value_ a rare jewel; he has found that which will not only contribute more than any thing to his comfort in this life_ but will forward him in the way to heaven,20250223
A great duty enjoined_ particularly to those that are the parents and instructors of children_ in order to the propagating of wisdom_ that it may not die with them: Train up children in that age of vanity_ to keep them from the sins and snares of it_ in that learning age_ to prepare them for what they are designed for. Catechise them; initiate them; keep them under discipline. Train them as soldiers_ who are taught to handle their arms_ keep rank_ and observe the word of command. Train them up_ not in the way they would go (the bias of their corrupt hearts would draw them aside)_ but in the way they should go_ the way in which_ if you love them_ you would have them go. Train up a child according as he is capable (as some take it)_ with a gentle hand_ as nurses feed children_ little and often_ Deut. vi. 7,20250223
A great duty pressed upon us_ to remember God as our creator_ not only to remember that God is our Creator_ that he made us and not we ourselves_ and is therefore our rightful Lord and owner_ but we must engage ourselves to him with the considerations which his being our Creator lay us under_ and pay him the honour and duty which we owe him as our Creator. Remember thy Creators; the word is plural_ as it is Job xxxv. 10_ Where is God my Makers? For God said_ Let us make man_ us_ Father_ Son_ and Holy Ghost. ,20250223
A great duty required by the laws of wisdom_ and in order to our getting and preserving wisdom: Keep thy heart with all diligence. God_ who gave us these souls_ gave us a strict charge with them: Man_ woman_ keep thy heart; take heed to thy spirit_ Deut. iv,20250223
A great duty required of us_ and that is to appear for the relief of oppressed innocency. If we see the lives or livelihoods of any in danger of being taken away unjustly_ we ought to bestir ourselves all we can to save them_ by disproving the false accusations on which they are condemned and seeking out proofs of their innocency. Though the persons be not such as we are under any particular obligation to_ we must help them_ out of a general zeal for justice. If any be set upon by force and violence_ and it be in our power to rescue them_ we ought to do it. Nay_ if we see any through ignorance exposing themselves to danger_ or fallen in distress_ as travellers upon the road_ ships at sea_ or any the like_ it is our duty_ though it be with peril to ourselves_ to hasten with help to them and not forbear to deliver them_ not to be slack_ or remiss_ or indifferent_ in such a case,20250223
A greyhound that is girt in the loins and fit for running; or (as the margin reads it) a horse_ which ought not to be omitted among the creatures that are comely in going_ for so he is_ especially when he is dressed up in his harness or trappings,20250223
A guard upon the lips is a guard to the soul. He that is cautious_ that thinks twice before he speaks once_ that_ if he have thought evil_ lays his hand upon his mouth to suppress it_ that keeps a strong bridle on his tongue and a strict hand on that bridle_ he keeps his soul from a great deal both of guilt and grief and saves himself the trouble of many bitter reflections on himself and reflections of others upon him,20250223
A guilty conscience represents to the sinner a flaming sword turning every way (Gen. iii. 24) and himself inevitably running on it. Again (v. 23): He knows that the day of darkness (or the night of darkness rather) is ready at his hand_ that it is appointed to him and cannot be put by_ that it is hastening on apace and cannot be put off. This day of darkness is something beyond death; it is that day of the Lord which to all wicked people will be darkness and not light and in which they will be doomed to utter_ endless_ darkness. Note_ Some wicked people_ though they seem secure_ have already received the sentence of death_ eternal death_ within themselves_ and plainly see hell gaping for them. No marvel that it follows (v.,20250223
A he-goat_ the comeliness of whose going is when he goes first and leads the flock. It is the comeliness of a Christian's going to go first in a good work and to lead others in the right way,20250223
A heart to enjoy them is so; this is the gift of God's grace. Unless he give us wisdom to make a right use of what he has_ in his providence_ bestowed upon us_ and withal peace of conscience_ that we may discern God's favour in the world's smiles_ we cannot make our souls enjoy any good in them.,20250223
A holy awe of this dreadful excellency should fall upon us and make us afraid. This would awaken impenitent sinners and bring them to repentance_ and would influence all to be careful to please him and afraid of offending him.,20250223
A humble petition to God. He will speak_ but the first word shall be a prayer_ and_ as I am willing to understand it_ it is a good prayer_ v,20250223
A humble subjection: Be not wise in thy own eyes. Note_ There is not a greater enemy to the power of religion_ and the fear of God in the heart_ than conceitedness of our own wisdom. Those that have an opinion of their own sufficiency think it below them_ and a disparagement to them_ to take their measures from_ much more to hamper themselves with_ religion's rules,20250223
A humble wise man saving himself and consulting his own good: The lips of the wise shall preserve them from doing that mischief to others which proud men do with their tongues_ and from bringing that mischief on themselves which haughty scorners are often involved in.,20250223
A humbling challenge which God gave to Job. After he had heaped up many hard questions upon him_ to show him_ by his manifest ignorance in the works of nature_ what an incompetent judge he was of the methods and designs of Providence_ he clenches the nail with one demand more_ which stands by itself here as the application of the whole. It should seem_ God paused awhile_ as Elihu had done_ to give Job time to say what he had to say_ or to think of what God had said; but Job was in such confusion that he remained silent_ and therefore God here put him upon replying_ v. 1_ 2. This is not said to be spoken out of the whirlwind_ as before; and therefore some think God said it in a still small voice_ which wrought more upon Job than the whirlwind did_ as upon Elijah_ 1 Kings xix. 12_ 13. My doctrine shall drop as the rain_ and then it does wonders. Though Job had not spoken any thing_ yet God is said to answer him; for he knows men's thoughts_ and can return a suitable answer to their silence. Here,20250223
A king by his folly and wilfulness comes to be impoverished. Though he was born in his kingdom_ came to it by inheritance_ though he has lived to be old in it and has had time to fill his treasures_ yet if he take ill courses_ and will no more be admonished as he has been_ thinking_ because he is old_ he is past it_ he becomes poor; his treasure is exhausted_ and perhaps he is forced to resign his crown and retire into privacy.,20250223
A king is not likely to continue if he have not a confirmed interest in the affections of the people; this is intimated_ but somewhat obscurely_ in the last two verses. 1. He that is king must have a successor_ a second_ a child that shall stand up in his stead_ his own_ suppose_ or perhaps that poor and wise child spoken of_ v,20250223
A king_ who_ when he appears in his majesty_ is looked upon with reverence and awe_ and all agree that there is no rising up against him; none can vie with him_ none can contend with him_ whoever does it_ it is at his peril. And_ if there is no rising up against an earthly prince_ woe to him then that strives with his Maker. It is intended that we should learn courage and fortitude in all virtuous actions from the lion and not to turn away for any difficulty we meet with; from the greyhound we may learn quickness and despatch_ from the he-goat the care of our family and those under our charge_ and from a king to have our children in subjection with all gravity_ and from them all to go well_ and to order the steps of our conversation so as that we may not only be safe_ but comely_ in going.,20250223
A large and particular account of the beauties of the church_ and of gracious souls on whom the image of God is renewed_ consisting in the beauty of holiness. In general_ he that is a competent judge of beauty_ whose judgment_ we are sure_ is according to truth_ and what all must subscribe to_ he has said_ Behold_ thou art fair. She had commended him_ and called all about her to take notice of his glories; and hereby she recommends herself to him_ gains his favour_ and_ in return for her respects_ he calls to all about him to take notice of her graces. Those that honour Christ he will honour_ 1 Sam. ii. 30.,20250223
A little that a righteous man has is better than the riches of many wicked. 1. Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for; he eats only the labour of his hands_ but that labour tends to life; he aims at nothing but to get an honest livelihood_ covets not to be rich and great_ but is willing to live and maintain his family. Nor does it tend only to his own life_ but he would enable himself to do good to others; he labours that he may have to give (Eph. iv. 28); all his business turns to some good account or other. Or it may be meant of his labour in religion; he takes most pains in that which has a tendency to eternal life; he sows to the Spirit_ that he may reap life everlasting,20250223
A little time may produce considerable changes_ and such as we little think of. We know not what the present day may bring forth; the evening must commend it. Nescis quid serus vesper vehat—Thou knowest not what the close of evening may bring with it. God has wisely kept us in the dark concerning future events_ and reserved to himself the knowledge of them_ as a flower of the crown_ that he may train us up in a dependence upon himself and a continued readiness for every event_ Acts i. 7.,20250223
A malicious mischievous man is here represented,20250223
A man may do a great deal of good_ or a great deal of hurt_ both to others and to himself_ according to the use he makes of his tongue. Many a one has been his own death by a foul tongue_ or the death of others by a false tongue; and_ on the contrary_ many a one has saved his own life_ or procured the comfort of it_ by a prudent gentle tongue_ and saved the lives of others by a seasonable testimony or intercession for them. And_ if by our words we must be justified or condemned_ death and life are_ no doubt_ in the power of the tongue. Tongues were Æsop's best meat_ and his worst,20250223
A man may have but a little silver and be satisfied with it_ may know when he has enough and covet no more. Godliness_ with contentment_ is great gain. I have enough_ says Jacob; I have all_ and abound_ says St. Paul: but_ ,20250223
A man of great sense and courage_ and one that knew as well when and how to speak as when and how to keep silence. Though he had so much respect to his friends as not to interrupt them with his speaking_ yet he had so much regard to truth and justice (his better friends) as not to betray them by his silence. He boldly pleads_,20250223
A man's wisdom is here said to be of use to him for the pumping of other people_ and diving into them,20250223
A meeting of the saints on earth. Professors of religion_ in the patriarchal age_ were called sons of God (Gen. vi. 2); they had then religious assemblies and stated times for them. The King came in to see his guests; the eye of God was on all present. But there was a serpent in paradise_ a Satan among the sons of God; when they come together he is among them_ to distract and disturb them_ stands at their right hand to resist them. The Lord rebuke thee_ Satan! Or_ 2. A meeting of the angels in heaven. They are the sons of God_ ch. xxxviii,20250223
A melancholy sight on earth_ and such as cannot but trouble every good man that has a sense of justice and a concern for mankind_ to see the oppression of the poor because they are poor and cannot defend themselves_ and the violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province_ oppression under colour of law and backed with power. The kingdom in general may have a good government_ and yet it may so happen that a particular province may be committed to a bad man_ by whose mal-administration justice may be perverted; so hard it is for the wisest of kings_ in giving preferments_ to be sure of their men; they can but redress the grievance when it appears,20250223
A monument of primitive theology. The first and great principles of the light of nature_ on which natural religion is founded_ are here_ in a warm_ and long_ and learned dispute_ not only taken for granted on all sides and not the least doubt made of them_ but by common consent plainly laid down as eternal truths_ illustrated and urged as affecting commanding truths. Were ever the being of God_ his glorious attributes and perfections_ his unsearchable wisdom_ his irresistible power_ his inconceivable glory_ his inflexible justice_ and his incontestable sovereignty_ discoursed of with more clearness_ fulness_ reverence_ and divine eloquence_ than in this book? The creation of the world_ and the government of it_ are here admirably described_ not as matters of nice speculation_ but as laying most powerful obligations upon us to fear and serve_ to submit to and trust in_ our Creator_ owner_ Lord_ and ruler. Moral good and evil_ virtue and vice_ were never drawn more to the life (the beauty of the one and the deformity of the other) than in this book; nor the inviolable rule of God's judgment more plainly laid down_ That happy are the righteous_ it shall be well with them; and Woe to the wicked_ it shall be ill with them. These are not questions of the schools to keep the learned world in action_ nor engines of state to keep the unlearned world in awe; no_ it appears by this book that they are sacred truths of undoubted certainty_ and which all the wise and sober part of mankind have in every age subscribed and submitted to. ,20250223
A necessary caution against bad company and all fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness_ ver. 14-19.,20250223
A necessary caution against bad company_ ver. 10-19.,20250223
A necessary caution against entertaining any favourable thoughts of prospering profaneness: __Let not thy heart envy sinners; do not grudge them either the liberty they take to sin or the success they are to be pitied rather than envied. Their prosperity is their portion (Ps. xii. nay_ it is their poison___ Prov. i,20250223
A new way of writing_ in which divine wisdom is taught us by Proverbs_ or short sentences_ which contain their whole design within themselves and are not connected with one another. We have had divine laws_ histories_ and songs_ and how divine proverbs; such various methods has Infinite Wisdom used for our instruction_ that_ no stone being left unturned to do us good_ we may be inexcusable if we perish in our folly. Teaching by proverbs was,20250223
A noble pattern of piety and virtue proposed to us for our imitation_ which_ if our consciences can witness for us that we conform to it_ will be our rejoicing_ as it was Job's in the day of evil.,20250223
A parent correcting his child. A tender parent can scarcely find in his heart to do this; it goes much against the grain. But he finds it is necessary; it is his duty_ and therefore he dares not withhold correction when there is occasion for it (spare the rod and spoil the child); he beats him with the rod_ gives him a gentle correction_ the stripes of the sons of men_ not such as we give to beasts. Beat him with the rod and he shall not die. The rod will not kill him; nay_ it will prevent his killing himself by those vicious courses which the rod will be necessary to restrain him from. For the present it is not joyous_ but grievous_ both to the parent and to the child; but when it is given with wisdom_ designed for good_ accompanied with prayer_ and blessed of God_ it may prove a happy means of preventing his utter destruction and delivering his soul from hell. Our great care must be about our children's souls; we must not see them in danger of hell without using all possible means_ with the utmost care and concern_ to snatch them as brands out of everlasting burnings. Let the body smart_ so that the spirit be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus,20250223
A parent encouraging his child_ telling him_ ,20250223
A parent instructing his child. He is here brought in persuading him to give his mind to his book_ and especially to the scriptures and his catechism_ to attend to the words of knowledge_ by which he might come to know his duty_ and danger_ and interest_ and not to think it enough to give them the hearing_ but to apply his heart to them_ to delight in them_ and bow his will to the authority of them. The heart is then applied to the instruction when the instruction is applied to the heart,20250223
A particular caution against the sin of whoredom_ ver. 3-14.,20250223
A particular description of her and of her excellent qualifications.,20250223
A particular instance of wisdom pressed upon us_ and that is subjection to authority_ and a dutiful and peaceable perseverance in our allegiance to the government which Providence has set over us. Observe_,20250223
A particular representation of the great danger which unwary young men are in of being inveigled into this snare_ ver. 6-23.,20250223
A passionate man is a brutish man. However at other times he may have some wisdom_ take him in his passion ungoverned_ and he is a fool in his folly; those are fools in whose bosom anger rests and in whose countenance anger rages. He has put off man_ and is become like a bear_ a raging bear_ a bear robbed of her whelps; he is as fond of the gratifications of his lusts and passions as a bear of her whelps (which_ though ugly_ are her own)_ as eager in the pursuit of them as she is in quest of her whelps when they are missing_ and as full of indignation if crossed in the pursuit.,20250223
A passionate resolution to persist in his complaint_ v. 1. Being daunted with the dread of God's majesty_ so that he could not plead his cause with him_ he resolves to give himself some ease by giving vent to his resentments. He begins with vehement language: __My soul is weary of my life_ weary of this body_ and impatient to get clear of it_ fallen out with life_ and displeased at it_ sick of it_ and longing for death.__ Through the weakness of grace he went contrary to the dictates even of nature itself. We should act more like men did we act more like saints. Faith and patience would keep us from being weary of our lives (and cruel to them_ as some read it)_ even when Providence has made them most wearisome to us; for that is to be weary of God's correction. Job_ being weary of his life and having ease no other way_ resolves to complain_ resolves to speak. He will not give vent to his soul by violent hands_ but he will give vent to the bitterness of his soul by violent words. Losers think they may have leave to speak; and unbridled passions_ as well as unbridled appetites_ are apt to think it an excuse for their excursions that they cannot help them: but what have we wisdom and grace for_ but to keep the mouth as with a bridle? Job's corruption speaks here_ yet grace puts in a word. 1. He will complain_ but he will leave his complaint upon himself. He would not impeach God_ nor charge him with unrighteousness or unkindness; but_ though he knew not particularly the ground of God's controversy with him and the cause of action_ yet_ in the general_ he would suppose it to be in himself and willingly bear all the blame,20250223
A peevish expostulation with God concerning his dealings with him. Now he speaks in the bitterness of his soul indeed_ not without some ill-natured reflections upon the righteousness of his God.,20250223
A penitent soul_ or one gathered_ one that had rambled and gone astray like a lost sheep_ but was now reduced_ gathered in from his wanderings_ gathered home to his duty_ and come at length to himself. The spirit that was dissipated after a thousand vanities is now collected and made to centre in God. Divine grace can make great sinners great converts_ and renew even those to repentance who_ after they had known the way of righteousness_ turned aside from it_ and heal their backslidings_ though it is a difficult case. It is only the penitent soul that God will accept_ the heart that is broken_ not the head that is bowed down like a bulrush only for a day_ David's repentance_ not Ahab's. And it is only the gathered soul that is the penitent soul_ that comes back from its by-paths_ that no longer scatters its way to the strangers (Jer. iii. but is united to fear God's name. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speak_ and therefore we have here the words of the penitent_ and those published. If eminent professors of religion fall into gross sin_ they are concerned_ for the honour of God and the repairing of the damage they have done to his kingdom_ openly to testify their repentance_ that the antidote may be administered as extensively as the poison.,20250223
A plain intimation what a hard thing it is to find a truly ingenious industrious man: __Seest thou a man diligent in his business? Thou wilt not see many such_ so epidemical are dulness and slothfulness.__ He is here commended who lays out himself to get business_ though it be but in a very low and narrow sphere_ and is not easy when he is out of business_ who loves business_ is quick and active in it_ and goes through it_ not only with constancy and resolution_ but with dexterity and expedition_ a man of despatch_ who knows how to bring a deal of business into a little compass.,20250223
A powerful inducement to this_ v,20250223
A preaching soul_ or one gathering. Being himself gathered to the congregation of saints_ out of which he had by his sin thrown himself_ and being reconciled to the church_ he endeavours to gather others to it that had gone astray like him_ and perhaps were led astray by his example. He that has done any thing to seduce his brother ought to do all he can to restore him. Perhaps Solomon called together a congregation of his people_ as he had done at the dedication of the temple (1 Kings so now at the rededicating of himself. In that assembly he presided as the people's mouth to God in prayer (v. 12); in this as God's mouth to them in preaching. God by his Spirit made him a preacher_ in token of his being reconciled to him; a commission is a tacit pardon. Christ sufficiently testifies his forgiving Peter by committing his lambs and sheep to his trust. Observe_ Penitents should be preachers; those that have taken warning themselves to turn and live should give warning to others not to go on and die. When thou art converted strengthen thy brethren. Preachers must be preaching souls_ for that only is likely to reach to the heart that comes from the heart. Paul served God with his spirit in the gospel of his Son_ Rom. i. 9.,20250223
A pressing exhortation to works of charity and bounty to the poor_ as the best cure of the vanity which our worldly riches are subject to and the only way of making them turn to a substantial good account_ ver. 1-6.,20250223
A promise to the charitable: He that gives to the poor shall himself be never the poorer for so doing; he shall not lack. If he have but little_ and so be in danger of lacking_ let him give out of his little_ and that will prevent it from coming to nothing; as the bounty of the widow of Sarepta to Elijah (for whom she made a little cake first) saved what she had_ when it was reduced to a handful of meal. If he have much_ let him give much out of it_ and that will prevent its growing less; he and his shall not want what is given in pious charity. What we gave we have,20250223
A prosperous condition_ though it has many advantages_ has often this mischief attending it_ that it makes men proud_ haughty_ and imperious: The rich answers the entreaties of the poor roughly_ as Nabal answered David's messengers with railing. It is a very foolish humour of some rich men_ especially those who have risen from little_ that they think their riches will warrant them to give hard words_ and_ even where they not design any rough dealing_ that it becomes them to answer roughly_ whereas gentlemen ought to be gentle_ Jam. iii. 17.,20250223
A proud fool exposing himself. Where there is pride in the heart_ and no wisdom in the head to suppress it_ it commonly shows itself in the words: In the mouth there is pride_ proud boasting_ proud censuring_ proud scorning_ proud commanding and giving law; this is the rod_ or branch_ of pride; the word is used only here and Isa. xi. 1. It grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart; it is a rod from that stem. The root must be plucked up_ or we cannot conquer this branch_ or it is meant of a smiting beating rod_ a rod of pride which strikes others. The proud man with his tongue lays about him and deals blows at pleasure_ but it will in the end be a rod to himself; the proud man shall come under an ignominious correction by the words of his own mouth_ not cut as a soldier_ but caned as a servant; and herein he will be beaten with his own rod_ Ps. lxiv.,20250223
A prudent mind_ which is the honour of a man_ is to be preferred before a robust body_ in which many of the brute creatures excel man. A man may by his wisdom effect that which he could never compass by his strength_ and may overcome those by out-witting them who are able to overpower him. Nay_ wisdom is better than weapons of war_ offensive or defensive_ v,20250223
A prudent subject may sometimes suggest that to an angry prince which will cool his resentments,20250223

A remnant of the sons of men were given him to be brought_ through his grace_ to his glory_ and these were those in whom his delights were. His church was the habitable part of his earth_ made habitable for him_ that the Lord God might dwell even among those that had been rebellious; and this he rejoiced in_ in the prospect of seeing his seed. Though he foresaw all the difficulties he was to meet with in his work_ the services and sufferings he was to go through_ yet_ because it would issue in the glory of his Father and the salvation of those sons of men that were given him_ he looked forward upon it with the greatest satisfaction imaginable_ in which we have all the encouragement we can desire to come to him and rely upon him for all the benefits designed us by his glorious undertaking.,20250223
A repeated warning of the pernicious consequences of the sin of whoredom_ ver. 24-35. We are here dissuaded from sin very much by arguments borrowed from our secular interests_ for it is not only represented as damning in the other world_ but as impoverishing in this.,20250223
A repetition of the great truth he had undertaken to prove in this discourse_ the vanity of the world_ ver. 8.,20250223

A ship in the midst of the sea. The leviathan indeed makes a path to shine after him_ one would think the deep to be hoary (Job xli. but a ship leaves no mark behind it_ and sometimes it is so tossed upon the waves that one would wonder how it lives at sea and gains its point.

A short account is given of what is to be seen in her. The question is asked_ What will you see in the Shulamite? And it is answered_ As it were the company of two armies. ,20250223
A sluggard is here exposed as a fool_ for,20250223
A spiritual disease supposed_ and that is self-conceit: Seest thou a man? Yes_ we see many a one_ wise in his own conceit_ who has some little sense_ but is proud of it_ thinks it much more than it is_ more than any of his neighbours_ have_ and enough_ so that he needs no more_ has such a conceit of his own abilities as makes him opinionative_ dogmatical_ and censorious; and all the use he makes of his knowledge is that it puffs him up. Or_ if by a wise man we understand a religious man_ it describes the character of those who_ making some show of religion_ conclude their spiritual state to be good when really it is very bad_ like Laodicea_ Rev. iii. 17,20250223
A summer's day supposed to be enjoyed—that life may continue long_ even many years_ and that_ by the goodness of God_ it may be made comfortable and a man may rejoice in them all. There are those that live many years in this world_ escape many dangers_ receive many mercies_ and therefore are secure that they shall want no good_ and that no evil shall befal them_ that the pitcher which has come so often from the well safe and sound shall never come home broken. But who are those that live many years and rejoice in them all? Alas! none; we have but hours of joy for months of sorrow. However_ some rejoice in their years_ their many years_ more than others; if these two things meet_ a prosperous state and a cheerful spirit_ these two indeed may do much towards enabling a man to rejoice in them all_ and yet the most prosperous state has its alloys and the most cheerful spirit has its damps; jovial sinners have their melancholy qualms_ and cheerful saints have their gracious sorrows; so that it is but a supposition_ not a case in fact_ that a man should live many years and rejoice in them all. But_ ,20250223

A swift destruction_ v,20250223
A tacit reproof to Job for not seeking to God_ but quarrelling with him: __Job_ if I had been in thy case_ I would not have been so peevish and passionate as thou art. I would have acquiesced in the will of God.__ It is easy to say what we would do if we were in such a one's case; but when it comes to the trial_ perhaps it will be found not so easy to do as we say,20250223
A tale-bearer_ that carries all the stories he can pick up_ true or false_ from house to house_ to make mischief and sow discord_ reveals secrets which he has been entrusted with_ and so breaks the laws_ and forfeits all the privileges_ of friendship and conversation.,20250223
A threatening to the uncharitable: He that hides his eyes_ that he may not see the miseries of the poor nor read their petitions_ lest his eye should affect his heart and extort some relief from him_ he shall have many a curse_ both from God and man_ and neither causeless_ and therefore they shall come. Woeful is the condition of that man who has the word of God and the prayers of the poor against him.,20250223
A time for God to plant a nation_ as that of Israel in Canaan_ and_ in order to that_ to pluck up the seven nations that were planted there_ to make room for them; and at length there was a time when God spoke concerning Israel too_ to pluck up and to destroy_ when the measure of their iniquity was full_ Jer. xviii. 7_ 9. There is a time for men to plant_ a time of the year_ a time of their lives; but_ when that which was planted has grown fruitless and useless_ it is time to pluck it up,20250223
A time for old towers to fall_ as that in Siloam (Luke xii. and for the temple itself to be so ruined as that not one stone should be left upon another; but also a time for towers and trophies too to be erected_ when national affairs prosper,20250223
A time of war_ when God draws the sword for judgment and gives it commission to devour_ when men draw the sword for justice and the maintaining of their rights_ when there is in the nations a disposition to war; but we may hope for a time of peace_ when the sword of the Lord shall be sheathed and he shall make wars to cease (Ps. xlvi. when the end of the war is obtained_ and when there is on all sides a disposition to peace. War shall not last always_ nor is there any peace to be called lasting on this side the everlasting peace. Thus in all these changes God has set the one over-against the other_ that we may rejoice as though we rejoiced not and weep as though we wept not.,20250223
A time to break down a family_ an estate_ a kingdom_ when it has ripened itself for destruction; but God will find a time_ if they return and repent_ to rebuild what he has broken down; there is a time_ a set time_ for the Lord to build up Zion_ Ps. cii. 13_ 16. There is a time for men to break up house_ and break off trade_ and so to break down_ which those that are busy in building up both must expect and prepare for,20250223
A time to cast away stones_ and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace_ and a time to refrain from embracing,20250223
A time to cast away stones_ by breaking down and demolishing fortifications_ when God gives peace in the borders_ and there is no more occasion for them; but there is a time to gather stones together_ for the making of strong-holds_ v,20250223
A time to embrace a friend when we find him faithful_ but a time to refrain from embracing when we find he is unfair or unfaithful_ and that we have cause to suspect him; it is then our prudence to be shy and keep at a distance. It is commonly applied to conjugal embraces_ and explained by 1 Cor. vii. 3-5; Joel ii. 16,20250223
A time to get_ and a time to lose; a time to keep_ and a time to cast away,20250223
A time to get_ get money_ get preferment_ get good bargains and a good interest_ when opportunity smiles_ a time when a wise man will seek (so the word is); when he is setting out in the world and has a growing family_ when he is in his prime_ when he prospers and has a run of business_ then it is time for him to be busy and make hay when the sun shines. There is a time to get wisdom_ and knowledge_ and grace_ when a man has a price put into his hand; but then let him expect there will come a time to spend_ when all he has will be little enough to serve his turn. Nay_ there will come a time to lose_ when what has been soon got will be soon scattered and cannot be held fast,20250223
A time to keep_ when we have use for what we have got_ and can keep it without running the hazard of a good conscience; but there may come a time to cast away_ when love to God may oblige us to cast away what we have_ because we must deny Christ and wrong our consciences if we keep it (Matt. x. 37_ and rather to make shipwreck of all than of the faith; nay_ when love to ourselves may oblige us to cast it away_ when it is for the saving of our lives_ as it was when Jonah's mariners heaved their cargo into the sea,20250223
A time to kill_ and a time to heal; a time to break down_ and a time to build up,20250223
A time to kill_ when the judgments of God are abroad in a land and lay all waste; but_ when he returns in ways of mercy_ then is a time to heal what he has torn (Hos. vi. 1_,20250223
A time to love_ and a time to hate; a time of war_ and a time of peace. 9 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? 10 I have seen the travail_ which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.,20250223
A time to love_ and to show ourselves friendly_ to be free and cheerful_ and it is a pleasant time; but there may come a time to hate_ when we shall see cause to break off all familiarity with some that we have been fond of_ and to be upon the reserve_ as having found reason for a suspicion_ which love is loth to admit,20250223
A time to rend the garments_ as upon occasion of some great grief_ and a time to sew_ them again_ in token that the grief is over. A time to undo what we have done and a time to do again what we have undone. Jerome applies this to the rending of the Jewish church and the sewing and making up of the gospel church thereupon,20250223
A time to rend_ and a time to sew; a time to keep silence_ and a time to speak,20250223
A time to weep_ and a time to laugh; a time to mourn_ and a time to dance,20250223
A time when God's providence calls to weep and mourn_ and when man's wisdom and grace will comply with the call_ and will weep and mourn_ as in times of common calamity and danger_ and there it is very absurd to laugh_ and dance_ and make merry (Isa. xxii. 12_ 13; Ezek.,20250223
A time when it becomes us_ and is our wisdom and duty_ to keep silence_ when it is an evil time (Amos v. when our speaking would be the casting of pearl before swine_ or when we are in danger of speaking amiss (Ps. xxxix. 2); but there is also a time to speak for the glory of God and the edification of others_ when silence would be the betraying of a righteous cause_ and when with the mouth confession is to be made to salvation; and it is a great part of Christian prudence to know when to speak and when to hold our peace,20250223
A trial is moved for_ and the motion earnestly pressed: __O that one_ any one_ would hear me; my cause is so good_ and my evidence so clear_ that I am willing to refer it to any indifferent person whatsoever; but my desire is that the Almighty himself would determine it.__ An upright heart does not dread a scrutiny. He that means honestly wishes he had a window in his breast_ that all men might see the intents of his heart. But an upright heart does particularly desire to be determined in every thing by the judgment of God_ which we are sure is according to the truth. It was holy David's prayer_ Search me_ O God! and know my heart; and it was blessed Paul's comfort_ He that judgeth me is the Lord.,20250223
A very rich recompence shall be made for it: He will pay him again_ in temporal_ spiritual_ and eternal blessings. Almsgiving is the surest and safest way of thriving.,20250223
A very warm dispute being begun between Job and his friends_ Eliphaz here makes a fair motion to put the matter to a reference. In all debates perhaps the sooner this is done the better if the contenders cannot end it between themselves. So well assured is Eliphaz of the goodness of his own cause that he moves Job himself to choose the arbitrators (v. 1): Call now_ if there be any that will answer thee; that is,20250223
A virtuous woman is a woman of resolution_ who_ having espoused good principles_ is firm and steady to them_ and will not be frightened with winds and clouds from any part of her duty,20250223
A wicked heart by the tongue becomes very hurtful; for the mouth of fools belches out foolishness_ which is very offensive; and the corrupt communication which proceeds from an evil treasure within (the filthiness_ and foolish talking_ and jesting) corrupts the good manners of some and debauches them_ and grieves the good hearts of others and disturbs them.,20250223
A wicked man is proved to be a fool by this_ that he never heeds what he says_ but his mouth pours out evil things_ to the dishonour of God and religion_ his own reproach_ and the hurt of others. Doubtless that is an evil heart which thus overflows with evil.,20250223
A wise man is here advised not to set his wit to a fool's_ not to dispute with him_ or by contending with him to think either of fastening reason upon him or gaining right from him: If a wise man contend with a wise man_ he may hope to be understood_ and_ as far as he has reason and equity on his side_ to carry his point_ at least to bring the controversy to a head and make it issue amicably; but_ if he contend with a foolish man_ there is no rest; he will see no end of it_ nor will he have any satisfaction in it_ but must expect to be always uneasy. 1. Whether the foolish man he contends with rage or laugh_ whether he take angrily or scornfully what is said to him_ whether he rail at it or mock at it_ one of the two he will do_ and so there will be no rest. However it is given_ it will be ill-taken_ and the wisest man must expect to be either scolded or ridiculed if he contend with a fool. He that fights with a dunghill_ whether he be conqueror or conquered_ is sure to be defiled. 2.,20250223
A wise man is strong; yea_ a man of knowledge increaseth strength. 6 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.,20250223
A wise man will be of few words_ as being afraid of speaking amiss: He that has knowledge_ and aims to do good with it_ is careful_ when he does speak to speak to the purpose_ and says little in order that he may take time to deliberate. He spares his words_ because they are better spared than ill-spent. ,20250223
A wise man will hear_ and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 6 To understand a proverb_ and the interpretation; the words of the wise_ and their dark sayings.,20250223
A wise man will observe these two rules about his anger: 1. Not to be over-hasty in his resentments: Discretion teaches us to defer our anger_ to defer the admission of it till we have thoroughly considered all the merits of the provocation_ seen them in a true light and weighed them in a just balance; and then to defer the prosecution of it till there be no danger of running into any indecencies. Plato said to his servant_ __I would beat thee_ but that I am angry.__ Give it time_ and it will cool,20250223
A wise man will reckon those his friends who deal faithfully with him: __Rebuke such a one_ and he will love thee for thy plain dealing_ will thank thee_ and desire thee to do him the same good turn another time_ if there be occasion.__ It is as great an instance of wisdom to take a reproof well as to give it well_ ,20250223
A witness that is conscientious will not dare to give in a testimony that is in the least untrue_ nor_ for good-will or ill-will_ represent a thing otherwise than according to the best of his knowledge_ whoever is pleased or displeased_ and then judgment runs down like a river,20250223
A woman that fears the Lord_ shall have praise of God (Rom. ii. 29) and of men too. It is here shown_ ,20250223
A word is enough to the wise. A gentle reproof will enter not only into the head_ but into the heart of a wise man_ so as to have a strong influence upon him; for_ if but a hint be given to conscience_ let it alone to carry it on and prosecute it,20250223
A wounded spirit who can bear? Job_ by asking here_ Why hidest thou thy face? teaches us that_ when at any time we are under the sense of God's withdrawings_ we are concerned to enquire into the reason of them—what is the sin for which he corrects us and what the good he designs us. Job's sufferings were typical of the sufferings of Christ_ from whom not only men hid their faces (Isa. liii. but God hid his_ witness the darkness which surrounded him on the cross when he cried out_ My God_ my God_ why hast thou forsaken me? If this were done to these green trees_ what shall be done to the dry? They will for ever be forsaken.,20250223
Abraham's proselytes are called the souls that he had gotten_ Gen. xii,20250223
Abundantly more riches_ true riches_ are to be got by the service of God than by the service of the world. ,20250223
Abused power will not last. If the rod of authority turn into a rod of anger_ if men rule by passion instead of prudence_ and_ instead of the public welfare_ aim at nothing so much as the gratifying of their own resentments_ it shall fail and be broken_ and their power shall not bear them out in their exorbitances_ Isa. x. 24_ 25.,20250223
According to the eternal purpose and counsel of God,20250223
According to the written word. Thus it is written that in the world we must have tribulation_ that_ since we sin daily_ we must expect to smart for it; and_ 3. According to the usual way and custom_ the track of Providence_ nothing but what is common to men; and to expect that God's counsels should change_ his method alter_ and his word fail_ to please us_ is as absurd and unreasonable as to think the earth should be forsaken for us and the rock removed out of its place.,20250223
Achan saw_ and then took_ the accursed thing. That heart must needs wander that walks after the eyes; for then it looks no further than the things that are seen_ whereas it ought to be in heaven whither the eyes cannot reach: it should follow the dictates of religion and right reason: if it follow the eye_ it will be misled to that for which God will bring men into judgment_ Eccl. xi,20250223
Adultery hides its head for shame. The sinners themselves_ even the most impudent_ do what they can to hide their sin: si non caste_ tamen caute—if not chastely_ yet cautiously; and after all the wretched endeavours of the factors for hell to take away the reproach of it_ it is and ever will be a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret_ Eph. v,20250223
Adultery_ ver. 9-12,20250223
Advantages of the Righteous.,20250223
Affliction seized him_ and surprised him. It seized him (v. 16): The days of affliction have taken hold upon me_ have caught me (so some); they have arrested me_ as the bailiff arrests the debtor_ claps him on the back_ and secures him. When trouble comes with commission it will take fast hold_ and not lose its hold. It surprised him (v. 27): __The days of affliction prevented me___ that is_ __they came upon me without giving me any previous warning. I did not expect them_ nor make any provision for such an evil day.__ Observe_ He reckons his affliction by days_ which will soon be numbered and finished_ and are nothing to the ages of eternity_ 2 Cor. iv,20250223
After Agur's confession and creed_ here follows his litany_ where we may observe_,20250223
After death: Where is he? He is not where he was; his place knows him no more; but is he nowhere? So some read it. Yes_ he is somewhere; and it is a very awful consideration to think where those are that have given up the ghost_ and where we shall be when we give it up. It has gone to the world of spirits_ gone into eternity_ gone to return no more to this world.,20250223
After he had convinced and humbled him_ and brought him to repentance for what he had said amiss_ then he owned him in what he had said well_ comforted him_ and put honour upon him; not till then: for we are not ready for God's approbation till we judge and condemn ourselves; but then he thus pleaded his cause_ for he that has torn will heal us_ he that has smitten will bind us. The Comforter shall convince_ John xvi,20250223
After that excellent discourse concerning wisdom in the foregoing chapter Job sat down and paused awhile_ not because he had talked himself out of breath_ but because he would not_ without the leave of the company_ engross the talk to himself_ but would give room for his friends_ if they pleased_ to make their remarks on what he had said; but they had nothing to say_ and therefore_ after he had recollected himself a little_ he went on with his discourse concerning his own affairs_ as recorded in this and the two following chapters_ in which_,20250223
After that he said no more to that purport. The words of Job judging and condemning himself began_ ch. xl. 4_ 5. Here he goes on with words to the same purport. Though his patience had not its perfect work_ his repentance for his impatience had. He is here thoroughly humbled for his folly and unadvised speaking_ and it was forgiven him. Good men will see and own their faults at last_ though it may be some difficulty to bring them to do this. Then_ when God had said all that to him concerning his own greatness and power appearing in the creatures_ then Job answered the Lord (v. 1)_ not by way of contradiction (he had promised not so to answer again_ ch. xl. but by way of submission; and thus we must all answer the calls of God.,20250223
After this solemn preface_ one would have expected something new and surprising; but no; here is a plain and common_ but very needful caution against the barbarous and inhuman practices of oppressing poor people. Observe_,20250223
Against drunkenness_ v. 4_ 5. He must not drink wine or strong drink to excess; he must never sit to drink_ as they used to do in the day of their king_ when the princes made him sick with bottles of wine_ Hos. vii,20250223
Against idolatry_ which is spiritual whoredom. Wisdom will keep thee from all familiarity with the worshippers of images_ and all inclination to join with them_ which had for many ages been of such pernicious consequence to Israel and proved so to Solomon himself,20250223
Against the debauching of the intellectual powers and faculties of the soul by the lusts and appetites of the body. Wisdom will keep thee from being captivated by the carnal mind_ and from subjecting the spirit to the dominion of the flesh_ that notorious adulteress which forsakes its guide_ violates the covenant of our God_ which inclines to death_ and which_ when it has got an undisturbed dominion_ makes the case of the soul desperate.,20250223
Against the just th' Almighty's arrows fly_,20250223
All Christ's gracious returns to his people take rise from himself. It is not they_ it is his own soul_ that puts him into the chariots of his people; for he is gracious because he will be gracious_ and loves his Israel because he would love them; not for their sakes_ be it known to them.,20250223
All Job's three friends_ in their last discourses_ had been very copious in describing the miserable condition of a wicked man in this world. __It is true___ says Job_ __remarkable judgments are sometimes brought upon notorious sinners_ but not always; for we have many instances of the great and long prosperity of those that are openly and avowedly wicked; though they are hardened in their wickedness by their prosperity_ yet they are still suffered to prosper.__,20250223
All are under the light of his knowledge and are naked and open before him. All partake of the light of his goodness: it seems especially to be meant of that. He is good to all; the earth is full of his goodness. He is Deus optimus—God_ the best of beings_ as well as maximus—the greatest: he has power to destroy; but his pleasure is to show mercy. All the creatures live upon his bounty.,20250223
All believers speak with pleasure of the omniscience of Christ_ as the spouse here of his eyes; for_ though it be terrible to his enemies as a flame of fire (Rev. i. yet it is amiable and comfortable to his friends_ as doves' eyes_ for it is a witness to their integrity. Thou knowest all things_ thou knowest that I love thee. Blessed and holy are those that walk always as under the eye of Christ. ,20250223
All flesh shall perish together_ and man shall turn again unto dust.,20250223
All his care is to save himself from labour and cold. See his posture: He hides his hand in his bosom_ pretends he is lame and cannot work; his hands are cold_ and he must warm them in his bosom; and_ when they are warm there_ he must keep them so. He hugs himself in his own ease and is resolved against labour and hardship. Let those work that love it; for his part he thinks there is no such fine life as sitting still and doing nothing.,20250223
All his honour shall be laid and lost in the dust_ or stained with perpetual infamy_ so that he shall have no name in the street_ departing without being desired. Thus the judgments of God follow him_ after death_ in this world_ as an indication of the misery his soul is in after death_ and an earnest of that everlasting shame and contempt to which he shall rise in the great day. The memory of the just is blessed_ but the name of the wicked shall rot_ Prov. x. 7.,20250223
All his measures were already broken and he was full of confusion_ v. 11_ 12. He owns he had_ in his prosperity_ often pleased himself both with projects of what he should do and prospects of what he should enjoy; but now he looked upon his days as past_ or drawing towards a period; all those purposes were broken off and those expectations dashed. He had had thoughts about enlarging his border_ increasing his stock_ and settling his children_ and many pious thoughts_ it is likely_ of promoting religion in his country_ redressing grievances_ reforming the profane_ relieving the poor_ and raising funds perhaps for charitable uses; but he concluded that all these thoughts of his heart were now at an end_ and that he should never have the satisfaction of seeing his designs effected. Note_ The period of our days will be the period of all our contrivances and hopes for this world; but_ if with full purpose of heart we cleave to the Lord_ death will not break off that purpose. Job_ being thus put upon new counsels_ was under a constant uneasiness (v. 12): The thoughts of his heart being broken_ they changed the night into day and shortened the light. Some_ in their vanity and riot_ turn night into day and day into night; but Job did so through trouble and anguish of spirit_ which were a hindrance_ ,20250223
All his neighbours and relations shall look upon him to be in such bad circumstances that_ when he is dead_ no man shall look for his goods_ none of his kindred shall expect to be a penny the better for him_ nor be willing to take out letters of administration for what he leaves behind him. In all this Zophar reflects upon Job_ who had lost all and was reduced to the last extremity.,20250223
All his saints are in his hand_ which tenderly holds their aching heads,20250223
All is ours if we are Christ's. Those that can by faith lay claim to Christ may lay claim to all that is his,20250223
All our joy shall centre in God: __We will rejoice_ not in the ointments_ or the chambers_ but in thee. It is God only that is our exceeding joy_ Ps. xliii,20250223
All scripture_ we are sure_ is given by inspiration of God_ and is profitable for the support and advancement of the interests of his kingdom among men_ and it is never the less so for there being found in it some things dark and hard to be understood_ which those that are unlearned and unstable wrest to their own destruction. In our belief both of the divine extraction and of the spiritual exposition of this book we are confirmed by the ancient_ constant_ and concurring testimony both of the church of the Jews_ to whom were committed the oracles of God_ and who never made any doubt of the authority of this book_ and of the Christian church_ which happily succeeds them in that trust and honour.,20250223
All sin will be bitterness in the end_ and this sin particularly. It bites like a serpent_ when the drunkard is made sick by his surfeit_ thrown by it into a dropsy or some fatal disease_ beggared and ruined in his estate_ especially when his conscience is awakened and he cannot reflect upon it without horror and indignation at himself_ but worst of all_ at last_ when the cup of drunkenness shall be turned into a cup of trembling_ the cup of the Lord's wrath_ the dregs of which he must be for ever drinking_ and shall not have a drop of water to cool his inflamed tongue. To take off the force of the temptation that there is in the pleasure of the sin_ foresee the punishment of it_ and what it will at last end in if repentance prevent not. In its latter end it bites (so the word is); think therefore what will be in the end thereof. But the inspired writer chooses to specify those pernicious consequences of this sin which are present and sensible.,20250223
All that are themselves saints will turn to those that are so_ will choose them for their friends and converse with them_ will choose them for their judges and consult them. See Ps. cxix. 79. The saints shall judge the world_ 1 Cor. vi. 1_ 2. Walk in the way of good men (Prov. ii. the old way_ the footsteps of the flock. Every one chooses some sort of people or other to whom he studies to recommend himself_ and whose sentiments are to him the test of honour and dishonour. Now all true saints endeavour to recommend themselves to those that are such_ and to stand right in their opinion. ,20250223
All that are unsanctified have a like rooted antipathy to godliness and godly people: He that is upright in the way_ that makes conscience of what he says and does_ is an abomination to the wicked_ whose wickedness is restrained perhaps and suppressed_ or_ at least_ shamed and condemned_ by the uprightness of the upright. Thus Cain did_ who was of his father the devil. And this is not only the wickedness of the wicked_ that they hate those whom God loves_ but their misery too_ that they hate those whom them shall shortly see in everlasting bliss and honour_ and who shall have dominion over them in the morning_ Ps. xlix. 14.,20250223
All that he does to his sores is to scrape them; they are not bound up with soft rags_ not mollified with ointment_ not washed or kept clean_ no healing plasters laid on them_ no opiates_ no anodynes_ ministered to the poor patient_ to alleviate the pain and compose him to rest_ nor any cordials to support his spirits; all the operation is the scraping of the ulcers_ which_ when they had come to a head and began to die_ made his body all over like a scurf_ as is usual in the end of the small-pox. It would have been an endless thing to dress his boils one by one; he therefore resolves thus to do it by wholesale—a remedy which one would think as bad as the disease. ,20250223
All that remember his love more than wine will love him with a superlative love. Nor is any love acceptable to Christ but the love of the upright_ love in sincerity_ Eph. vi. 24.,20250223
All the events concerning us_ with the exact time of them_ are determined and appointed in the counsel and foreknowledge of God_ and all in wisdom: To every purpose there is a time prefixed_ and it is the best time_ for it is time and judgment_ time appointed both in wisdom and righteousness; the appointment is not chargeable with folly or iniquity,20250223
All the instruments of slaughter that are used against him do him no hurt and therefore are not error to him_,20250223
All the while my breath is in me_ and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,20250223
All their happiness they have as heirs; it is grounded upon their sonship. ,20250223
All they eat and drink is got by rapine and oppression. Do wicked men think the time lost in which they are not doing hurt? Let good men make it as much their business and delight to do good. Amici_ diem perdidi—Friends_ I have lost a day. And let all that are wise_ and wish well to themselves_ avoid the society of the wicked; for_ ,20250223
All this contempt put upon him was caused by the troubles he was in (v. 11): __Because he has loosed my cord_ has taken away the honour and power with which I was girded (ch. xii. has scattered what I had got together and untwisted all my affairs—because he has afflicted me_ therefore they have let loose the bridle before me___ that is_ __have given themselves a liberty to say and do what they please against me.__ Those that by Providence are stripped of their honour may expect to be loaded with contempt by inconsiderate ill-natured people. __Because he hath loosed his cord__ (the original has that reading also)_ that is_ __because he has taken off his bridle of restraint from off their malice_ they cast away the bridle from me___ that is_ __they make no account of my authority_ nor stand in any awe of me.__ It is owing to the hold God has of the consciences even of bad men_ and the restraints he lays upon them_ that we are not continually thus insulted and abused; and_ if at any time we meet with such ill treatment_ we must acknowledge the hand of God in taking off those restraints_ as David did when Shimei cursed him: So let him curse_ for the Lord hath bidden him. Now in all this,20250223
All this would not countervail the want of heavenly wisdom nor be the ransom of a soul lost by its own folly. ,20250223
All this would not make a man half so happy_ no_ not in this world_ as those are who have true wisdom_ though they have none of all these things. ,20250223
All this would not purchase heavenly wisdom; no_ it would utterly be contemned; it cannot be gotten for gold_ Job xxviii. 15_ &c. ,20250223
All thy satisfaction will be found in this;__ and a soul without true wisdom and grace is really a dead soul. Secondly_ __It will be thy guard and guide_ thy convoy and conductor_ through all the dangers and difficulties of thy journey through this wilderness. Love wisdom_ and cleave to her_ and she shall preserve thee_ she shall keep thee,20250223
Allow that I have understanding as well as you; but see how they seek occasion against him: that is misconstrued_ as if he pretended to be wiser than any man. Because he will not grant to them the monopoly of wisdom_ they will have it thought that he claims it to himself_ v. 7-9. As if he thought he had the advantage of all mankind,20250223
Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high_ and fears shall be in the way_ and the almond tree shall flourish_ and the grasshopper shall be a burden_ and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home_ and the mourners go about the streets: 6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed_ or the golden bowl be broken_ or the pitcher be broken at the fountain_ or the wheel broken at the cistern. 7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.,20250223
Always keep up high thoughts of religion_ and do all thou canst to bring it into reputation_ and maintain the credit of it among men. Concur with God in his purpose_ which is to magnify the law and make it honourable_ and do what thou canst to serve that purpose.__ Let Wisdom's children not only justify her_ but magnify her_ and prefer her before that which is dearest to them in this world. In honouring those that fear the Lord_ though they are low in the world_ and in regarding a poor wise man_ we exalt wisdom.,20250223
Among the children of men divine Providence has so ordered it that some are rich and others poor_ and these are intermixed in societies: The Lord is the Maker of both_ both the author of their being and the disposer of their lot. The greatest man in the world must acknowledge God to be his Maker_ and is under the same obligations to be subject to him that the meanest is; and the poorest has the honour to be the work of God's hands as much as the greatest. Have they not all one Father? Mal. ii. 10; Job xxxi,20250223
Among the children of the same parents it is no new thing for some to be hopeful and others the contrary; now here we are taught to distinguish. 1. There is great hope of those that have a reverence for their parents_ and are willing to be advised and admonished by them. He is a wise son_ and is in a far way to be wiser_ that hears his father's instruction_ desires to hear it_ regards it_ and complies with it_ and does not merely give it the hearing,20250223
An account of four things that are intolerable_ that is_ four sorts of persons that are very troublesome to the places where they live and the relations and companies they are in; the earth is disquieted for them_ and groans under them as a burden it cannot bear_ and they are all much alike:—1. A servant when he is advanced_ and entrusted with power_ who is_ of all others_ most insolent and imperious; witness Tobiah the servant_ the Ammonite_ Neh. ii. 10,20250223
An account of four things that are unsearchable_ too wonderful to be fully known. And here_,20250223
An account of seven things which God hates_ ver. 16-19.,20250223
An account_ upon occasion of this caution_ of some wicked generations of men_ that are justly abominable to all that are virtuous and good. 1. Such as are abusive to their parents_ give them bad language and wish them ill_ call them bad names and actually injure them. There is a generation of such; young men of that black character commonly herd together_ and irritate one another against their parents. A generation of vipers those are who curse their natural parents_ or their magistrates_ or their ministers_ because they cannot endure the yoke; and those are near of kin to them who_ though they have not yet arrived at such a pitch of wickedness as to curse their parents_ yet do not bless them_ cannot give them a good word_ and will not pray for them,20250223
An addition to it in one word; there it was said_ He that speaks lies shall not escape_ and intimated that he shall be punished. Here it is said_ His punishment shall be such as will be his destruction: he shall perish; the lies he forged against others will be his own ruin. It is a damning destroying sin.,20250223
An ancient way of teaching. It was the most ancient way among the Greeks; each of the seven wise men of Greece had some one saying that he valued himself upon_ and that made him famous. These sentences were inscribed on pillars_ and had in great veneration as that which was said to come down from heaven. A cœlo descendit_ Gnothi seauton—Know thyself is a precept which came down from heaven,20250223
An answer to the excuse that is commonly make for the omission of this duty. Thou wilt say_,20250223
An argument to enforce this call_ taken from the great comfort which this will be to their parents_ v. 24_ 25. Note,20250223
An assurance of happiness to all those that do hearken to Wisdom. They are blessed_ v. 32_ and again v,20250223
An eagle in the air. Which way she has flown cannot be discovered either by the footstep or by the scent_ as the way of a beast may upon ground; nor can we account for the wonderful swiftness of her flight_ how soon she has gone beyond our ken. ,20250223
An earnest exhortation to the study of wisdom_ that is_ of true religion and godliness_ borrowed from the good instructions which his father gave him_ and enforced with many considerable arguments_ ver. 1-13.,20250223
An encomium of wisdom (v. 1)_ that is_ of true piety_ guided in all its exercises by prudence and discretion. The wise man is the good man_ that knows God and glorifies him_ knows himself and does well for himself; his wisdom is a great happiness to him_ for,20250223
An enumeration of four things which are majestic and stately in their going_ which look great:— 1. A lion_ the king of beasts_ because strongest among beasts. Among beasts it is strength that gives the pre-eminence_ but it is a pity that it should do so among men_ whose wisdom is their honour_ not their strength and force. The lion turns not away_ nor alters his pace_ for fear of any pursuers_ since he knows he is too hard for them. Herein the righteous are bold as a lion_ that they turn not away from their duty for fear of any difficulty they meet with in it,20250223
An estate that is suddenly raised is often as suddenly ruined. It was raised hastily_ but_ not being raised honestly_ it proves soon ripe and soon rotten: The end thereof shall not be blessed of God_ and_ if he do not bless it_ it can neither be comfortable nor of any continuance; so that he who got it at the end will be a fool. He had better have taken time and built firmly.,20250223
An evil tongue is wounding (perverseness_ passion_ falsehood_ and filthiness there_ are a breach in the spirit); it wounds the conscience of the evil speaker_ and occasions either guilt or grief to the hearers_ and both are to be reckoned breaches in the spirit. Hard words indeed break no bones_ but many a heart has been broken by them.,20250223
An excellent direction to maintain high thoughts of God in our minds at all times: Be thou in the fear of the Lord every day and all the day long. We must be in the fear of the Lord as in our employment_ exercising ourselves in holy adorings of God_ in subjection to his precepts_ submission to his providences_ and a constant care to please him; we must be in it as in our element_ taking a pleasure in contemplating God's glory and complying with his will. We must be devoted to his fear (Ps. cxix. 38); and governed by it as our commanding principle in all we say and do. All the days of our life we must constantly keep up an awe of God upon our spirits_ must pay a deference to his authority_ and have a dread of his wrath. We must be always so in his fear as never to be out of it,20250223

An ill-natured_ cross-grained_ woman_ when she gets a husband_ one who_ having made herself odious by her pride and sourness_ so that one would not have thought any body would ever love her_ yet_ if at last she be married_ that honourable estate makes her more intolerably scornful and spiteful than ever. It is a pity that that which should sweeten the disposition should have a contrary effect. A gracious woman_ when she is married_ will be yet more obliging,20250223
An instance given of the honour of God: It is his glory to conceal a matter. He needs not search into any thing_ for he perfectly knows every thing by a clear and certain view_ and nothing can be hidden from him; and yet his own way is in the sea and his path in the great waters. There is an unfathomable depth in his counsels_ Rom. xi,20250223
An old maid-servant that has prevailed with her mistress_ by humouring her_ and_ as we say_ getting the length of her foot_ to leave her what she has_ or is as dear to her as if she was to be her heir_ such a one likewise will be intolerably proud and malicious_ and think all too little that her mistress gives her_ and herself wronged if any thing be left from her. Let those therefore whom Providence has advanced to honour from mean beginnings carefully watch against that sin which will most easily beset them_ pride and haughtiness_ which will in them_ of all others_ be most insufferable and inexcusable; and let them humble themselves with the remembrance of the rock out of which they were hewn.,20250223
An undutiful child become very miserable at last: His lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness; all his honour shall be laid in the dust_ and he shall for ever lose his reputation. Let him never expect any peace or comfort in his own mind_ no_ nor to prosper in this world. His days shall be shortened_ and the lamp of his life extinguished_ according to the reverse of the promise of the fifth commandment. His family shall be cut off and his posterity be a curse to him. And it will be his eternal ruin; the lamp of his happiness shall be put out in the blackness of darkness (so the word is)_ even that which is for ever_ Jude 13_ Matt. xxii. 13.,20250223
An undutiful child become very wicked by degrees. He began with despising his father and mother_ slighting their instructions_ disobeying their commands_ and raging at their rebukes_ but at length he arrives at such a pitch of impudence and impiety as to curse them_ to give them scurrilous and opprobrious language_ and to wish mischief to those that were instruments of his being and have taken so much care and pains about him_ and this in defiance of God and his law_ which had made this a capital crime (Exod. xxi. 17_ Matt. xv. and in violation of all the bonds of duty_ natural affection_ and gratitude,20250223
An unenclosed lodging (v. 6): Whose house I have made the wilderness_ where he has room enough to traverse his ways_ and snuff up the wind at his pleasure_ as the wild ass is said to do (Jer. ii. as if he had to live upon the air_ for it is the barren land that is his dwelling. Observe_ The tame ass_ that labours_ and is serviceable to man_ has his master's crib to go to both for shelter and food_ and lives in a fruitful land: but the wild ass_ that will have his liberty_ must have it in a barren land. He that will not labour_ let him not eat. He that will shall eat the labour of his hands_ and have also to give to him that needs. Jacob_ the shepherd_ has good red pottage to spare_ when Esau_ a sportsman_ is ready to perish for hunger. A further description of the liberty and livelihood of the wild ass we have_ v. 7_ 8. ,20250223
An utter destruction. It will be total; he shall go away like a dream_ or vision of the night_ which was a mere phantasm_ and_ whatever in it pleased the fancy_ it is quite gone_ and nothing of it remains but what serves us to laugh at the folly of. It will be final (v. 9): The eye that saw him_ and was ready to adore him_ shall see him no more_ and the place he filled shall no more behold him_ having given him an eternal farewell when he went to his own place_ as Judas_ Acts i. 25.,20250223
And (Ecclesiasticus vi.,20250223
And a happy presage it was of his restoration to his prosperity again_ and indeed a good step towards it_ that he was thus restored to the priesthood. Thus he became a type of Christ_ through whom alone we and our spiritual sacrifices are acceptable to God; see 1 Pet. ii,20250223
And again_ __Get wisdom_ and with all thy getting_ get understanding_ v,20250223
And dost thou bring me_ such a worthless worm as I am_ into judgment with thee who art so quick sighted to discover the least failing_ so holy to hate it_ so just to condemn it_ and so mighty to punish it?__ The consideration of our own inability to contend with God_ of our own sinfulness and weakness_ should engage us to pray_ Lord_ enter not into judgment with thy servant. ,20250223
And floating wrecks of ruined innocence.,20250223

And he chooses the black and dark night as fittest for his purpose_ not the moonlight nights_ when he might be discovered,20250223
And here also it is true that God will not help the evil-doers; they throw themselves out of his protection_ and forfeit his favour. He will not take the ungodly by the hand (so it is in the margin)_ will not have fellowship and communion with them; for what communion can there be between light and darkness? He will not lend them his hand to pull them out of the miseries_ the eternal miseries_ into which they have plunged themselves; they will then stretch out their hand to him for help_ but it will be too late: he will not take them by the hand. Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed. It is true that the dwelling-place of the wicked_ sooner or later_ will come to nought. Those only who make God their dwelling-place are safe for ever_ Ps. xc. 1; xci. 1. Those who make other things their refuge will be disappointed. Sin brings ruin on persons and families. Yet to argue (as Bildad_ I doubt_ slyly does) that because Job's family was sunk_ and he himself at present seemed helpless_ therefore he certainly was an ungodly wicked man_ was neither just nor charitable_ as long as there appeared no other evidence of his wickedness and ungodliness. Let us judge nothing before the time_ but wait till the secrets of all hearts shall be made manifest_ and the present difficulties of Providence be solved to universal and everlasting satisfaction_ when the mystery of God shall be finished.,20250223

And if the stars have such a dominion over this earth (v. though they have their place in the heavens and are but mere matter_ much more has he who is their Maker and ours_ and who is an Eternal Mind. Now see how weak we are. 1. We cannot alter the influences of the stars (v. not theirs that are instrumental to produce the pleasures of the spring: Canst thou loose the bands of Orion?—that magnificent constellation which makes so great a figure (none greater)_ and dispenses rough and unpleasing influences_ which we cannot control nor repel. Both summer and winter will have their course. God can change them when he pleases_ can make the spring cold_ and so bind the sweet influences of Pleiades_ and the winter warm_ and so loose the bands of Orion; but we cannot,20250223
And it is but a little of divine knowledge that the best receive in this world. We know little in comparison with what is to be known_ and with what we shall know when we come to heaven. How little a portion is heard of God! ch. xxvi,20250223
And it is said to it_ by way of check to its insolence_ Hitherto shalt thou come_ but no further. The sea is God's for he made it_ he restrains it; he says to it_ Here shall thy proud waves be stayed_ v.,20250223
And it is therefore their care to keep their way_ and not turn aside out of it_ on either hand_ but to press towards perfection. Those that adhere to their duty secure their felicity. Keep thy way and God will keep thee.,20250223
And it should be our endeavour to keep as much as may be out of debt. Some sell their liberty to gratify their luxury.,20250223
And it was so_ when the days of their feasting were gone about_ that Job sent and sanctified them_ and rose up early in the morning_ and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said_ It may be that my sons have sinned_ and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.,20250223
And lastly_ he could not provide for the lions and the ravens_ ver. 39-41. If_ in these ordinary works of nature_ Job was puzzled_ how durst he pretend to dive into the counsels of God's government and to judge of them? In this (as bishop Patrick observes) God takes up the argument begun by Elihu (who came nearest to the truth) and prosecutes it in inimitable words_ excelling his_ and all other men's_ in the loftiness of the style_ as much as thunder does a whisper.,20250223
And men's own hearts sometimes speak aloud to them; there are clamours of conscience_ as well as whispers,20250223
And now choose you_ this day_ whom you will close with.,20250223
And now_ at length_ God does speak_ when Job_ by Elihu's clear and close arguings was mollified a little_ and mortified_ and so prepared to hear what God had to say. It is the office of ministers to prepare the way of the Lord. That which the great God designs in this discourse is to humble Job_ and bring him to repent of_ and to recant_ his passionate indecent expressions concerning God's providential dealings with him; and this he does by calling upon Job to compare God's eternity with his own time_ God's omniscience with his own ignorance_ and God's omnipotence with his own impotency.,20250223
And so it was prophesied of_ Isa. xxv,20250223
And so the church is black and yet comely; a believer is a sinner and yet a saint; his own righteousnesses are as filthy rags_ but he is clothed with the robe of Christ's righteousness. The Chaldee Paraphrase applies it to the people of Israel's blackness when they made the golden calf and their comeliness when they repented of it.,20250223
And still_ which way soever he looked_ they turned upon him; which way soever he fled_ they pursued him. My soul (Heb._ my principal one_ my princess); the soul is the principal part of the man; it is our glory; it is every way more excellent than the body_ and therefore that which pursues the soul_ and threatens that_ should be most dreaded. ,20250223
And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom_ that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.,20250223
And the Son also did himself rejoice before him in the beauty and harmony of the whole creation_ Ps. civ,20250223
And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved_ that goeth down sweetly_ causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.,20250223
And therefore he recommends to us the comfortable use of that which God has given us_ with an eye to him that is the giver_ as the best way both to answer the end of our having it and to obviate the mischiefs that commonly attend great estates_ ver. 18-20. So that if we can but learn out of this chapter how to manage the business of religion_ and the business of this world (which two take up most of our time)_ so that both may turn to a good account_ and neither our sabbath days nor our week-days may be lost_ we shall have reason to say_ We have learned two good lessons.,20250223
And therefore they will do nothing for him. Even good men are afraid of the worst sins_ so deceitful do they think their own hearts to be; and they know that the greatest gains of the world will not balance the least guilt. Secondly_ He dreads the temptations of a poor condition_ and for that reason_ and no other_ deprecates that: Lest I be poor and steal. Poverty is a strong temptation to dishonesty_ and such as many are overcome by_ and they are ready to think it will be their excuse; but it will not bear them out at God's bar any more than at men's to say_ __I stole because I was poor;__ yet_ if a man steal for the satisfying of his soul when he is hungry_ it is a case of compassion (ch. vi. 30) and what even those that have some principles of honesty in them may be drawn to. But observe why Agur dreads this_ not because he should endanger himself by it_ __Lest I steal_ and be hanged for it_ whipped or put in the stocks_ or sold for a bondman___ as among the Jews poor thieves were_ who had not wherewithal to make restitution; but lest he should dishonour God by it: __Lest I should steal_ and take the name of my God in vain_ that is_ discredit my profession of religion by practices disagreeable to it.__ Or_ __Lest I steal_ and_ when I am charged with it_ forswear myself.__ He therefore dreads one sin_ because it would draw on another_ for the way of sin is downhill. Observe_ He calls God his God_ and therefore he is afraid of doing any thing to offend him because of the relation he stands in to him.,20250223
And this we are sensible of_ that_ by the interposition of the clouds between us and the sun_ we are_ ,20250223
And those who have such an interest as Job had in the esteem of others whose ipse dixit—bare assertion goes so far_ as they have a great opportunity of doing good_ so they must take great care lest they do hurt_ for a bad word out of their mouths is very infectious. ,20250223
And thou mourn at the last_ when thy flesh and thy body are consumed_ 12 And say_ How have I hated instruction_ and my heart despised reproof,20250223

And we are false to a trust if we do not; for the sacred deposit of religious doctrine and law was lodged in our hands with a charge to transmit it pure and entire to those that shall come after us_ 2 Tim. ii.,20250223
And_ as silence is an evidence of wisdom_ so it is a means of it_ as it gives time to think and hear,20250223
And_ as we have no book so useful to us in our devotions as David's psalms_ so have we none so serviceable to us_ for the right ordering of our conversations_ as Solomon's proverbs_ which as David says of the commandments_ are exceedingly broad_ containing_ in a little compass_ a complete body of divine ethics_ politics_ and economics_ exposing every vice_ recommending every virtue_ and suggesting rules for the government of ourselves in every relation and condition_ and every turn of the conversation. The learned bishop Hall has drawn up a system of moral philosophy out of Solomon's Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. The first nine chapters of this book are reckoned as a preface_ by way of exhortation to the study and practice of wisdom's rules_ and caution against those things that would hinder therein. We have then the first volume of Solomon's proverbs (ch. x.-xxiv.); after that a second volume (ch. xxv.-xxix.); and then Agur's prophecy (ch. xxx.)_ and Lemuel's (ch. xxxi.). The scope of all is one and the same_ to direct us so to order our conversation aright as that in the end we may see the salvation of the Lord. The best comment on these rules is to be ruled by them.,20250223
And_ because Christ is the darling of all the pure in heart_ let him be ours_ and let our desires be towards him and towards the kisses of his mouth.,20250223
And_ if Job said so_ he did in effect say_ My righteousness is more than God's (v. 9); for_ if he got nothing by his religion_ God was more beholden to him than he was to God. But_ though there might be some colour for it_ yet it was not fair to charge these words upon Job_ when he himself had made them the wicked words of prospering sinners (ch. xxi. 15_ What profit shall we have if we pray to him?) and had immediately disclaimed them. The counsel of the wicked is far from me_ ch. xxi,20250223
And_ if none dares declare his way to his face_ much less dare any repay him what he has done and make him refund what he has obtained by injustice. He is one of those great flies which break through the cobwebs of the law_ that hold only the little ones. This emboldens sinners in their sinful ways that they can brow-beat justice and make it afraid to meddle with them. But there is a day coming when those shall be told of their faults who now would not bear to hear of them_ those shall have their sins set in order before them_ and their way declared to their face_ to their everlasting confusion_ who would not have it done here_ to their conviction_ and those who would not repay the wrongs they had done shall have them repaid to them. ,20250223
And_ lastly_ Job observes (and perhaps observes it as part of the present_ though secret_ punishment of such sinners as these) that they are in a continual terror for fear of being discovered,20250223
And_ lastly_ the roof of her mouth is like the best wine (v. 9); her spiritual taste and relish_ or the words she speaks of God and man_ which come not from the teeth outward_ but from the roof of the mouth_ these are pleasing to God. The prayer of the upright is his delight. And_ when those that fear the Lord speak one to another as becomes them_ the Lord hearkens_ and hears with pleasure_ Mal. iii,20250223
And_ pampered with the ease_ seemed plump and fair Doth all his friends (amazing change!) surprise,20250223
And_ though they are not forbidden to invite those simple ones to Wisdom's house_ yet they are advised not to pursue the invitation by reproving and rebuking them. Reprove not a scorner; cast not these pearls before swine_ Matt. vii,20250223
Angels are God's servants_ waiting servants_ working servants; they are his ministers (Ps. civ. 4); bright and blessed beings they are_ but God neither needs them nor is benefited by them and is himself infinitely above them_ and therefore_ ,20250223
Angels are fixed_ but the very foundation of that house of clay in which man dwells is in the dust. A house of clay_ if built upon a rock_ might stand long; but_ if founded in the dust_ the uncertainty of the foundation will hasten its fall_ and it will sink with its own weight. As man was made out of the earth_ so he is maintained and supported by that which cometh out of the earth. Take away that_ and his body returns to its earth. We stand but upon the dust; some have a higher heap of dust to stand upon than others_ but still it is the earth that stays us up and will shortly swallow us up. ,20250223
Angels are immortal_ but man is soon crushed; the earthly house of his tabernacle is dissolved; he dies and wastes away_ is crushed like a moth between one's fingers_ as easily_ as quickly; one may almost as soon kill a man as kill a moth. A little thing will destroy his life. He is crushed before the face of the moth_ so the word is. If some lingering distemper_ which consumes like a moth_ be commissioned to destroy him_ he can no more resist it than he can resist an acute distemper_ which comes roaring upon him like a lion. See Hos. v. 12-14. Is such a creature as this to be trusted in_ or can any service be expected from him by that God who puts no trust in angels themselves?,20250223
Angels are pure spirits; the souls of men dwell in houses of clay: such the bodies of men are. Angels are free; human souls are housed_ and the body is a cloud_ a clog_ to it; it is its cage; it is its prison. It is a house of clay_ mean and mouldering; an earthen vessel_ soon broken_ as it was first formed_ according to the good pleasure of the potter. It is a cottage_ not a house of cedar or a house of ivory_ but of clay_ which would soon be in ruins if not kept in constant repair. ,20250223
Another dies slowly_ and with a great deal of previous pain and misery (v. in the betterness of his soul_ such as poor Job was himself now in_ and never eats with pleasure_ has no appetite to his food nor any relish of it_ through sickness_ or age_ or sorrow of mind. What great reason have those to be thankful that are in health and always eat with pleasure! And what little reason have those to complain who sometimes do not eat thus_ when they hear of many that never do!,20250223
Another improper word for which Elihu reproves Job (v. 14): Thou sayest thou shalt not see him; that is,20250223
Answer a fool according to his folly_ lest he be wise in his own conceit.,20250223
Any one may easily gather from the book of the creatures that the hand of the Lord has wrought this___ that is_ __that there is a wise Providence which guides and governs all these things by rules which we are neither acquainted with nor are competent judges of.__ Note_ From God's sovereign dominion over the inferior creatures we should learn to acquiesce in all his disposals of the affairs of the children of men_ though contrary to our measures.,20250223
Apostate angels hardened themselves against God_ but did not prosper_ 2 Pet. ii,20250223
Apprehend ourselves to be in danger: __Consider diligently what is before thee_ what meat and drink are before thee_ that thou mayest choose that which is safest for thee and which thou art least likely to eat and drink of to excess. Consider what company is before thee_ the ruler himself_ who_ if he be wise and good_ will take it as an affront for any of his guests to disorder themselves at his table.__ And_ if when we sit to eat with a ruler_ much more when we sit to eat with the ruler of rulers at the Lord's table_ must we consider diligently what is before us_ that we may not in any respect eat and drink unworthily_ unbecomingly_ lest that table become a snare. ,20250223
Arcturus_ Orion_ and Pleiades_ and in general the chambers of the south. The stars of which these are composed he made at first_ and put into that order_ and he still makes them_ preserves them in being_ and guides their motions; he makes them to be what they are to man_ and inclines the hearts of man to observe them_ which the beasts are not capable of doing. Not only those stars which we see and give names to_ but those also in the other hemisphere_ about the antarctic pole_ which never come in our sight_ called here the chambers of the south_ are under the divine direction and dominion. How wise is he then_ and how mighty!,20250223
Are pleasant. They are like the honey-comb_ sweet to the soul_ which tastes in them that the Lord is gracious; nothing more grateful and agreeable to the new man than the word of God_ and those words which are borrowed from it_ Ps. cxix. 103,20250223
Are riches and honour accounted blessings? They are so_ and them she reaches out with her left hand. For_ as she is ready to embrace those that submit to her with both arms_ so she is ready to give out to them with both hands. They shall have the wealth of this world as far as Infinite Wisdom sees good for them; while the true riches_ by which men are rich towards God_ are secured to them. Nor is there any honour_ by birth or preferment_ comparable to that which attends religion; it makes the righteous more excellent than his neighbour_ recommends men to God_ commands respect and veneration with all the sober part of mankind_ and will in the other world make those that are now buried in obscurity to shine forth as the sun. ,20250223
Are the heavens thus bountiful to the poor earth_ that is so far below them_ and wilt thou grudge thy bounty to thy poor brother_ who is bone of thy bone? Or thus: some will say_ Though we give but little to the poor_ yet_ thank God_ we have as charitable a heart as any.__ Nay_ says Solomon_ if the clouds be full of rain_ they will empty themselves; if there be charity in the heart_ it will show itself_ Jam. ii. 15_ 16. He that draws out his soul to the hungry will reach forth his hand to them_ as he has ability.,20250223
Are we sick or sore_ impoverished and stripped? Are our children removed by death or our friends unkind? This is what God has appointed for us_ and many such things are with him. Shall the earth be forsaken for us?,20250223
Arguments to enforce this exhortation. Consider,20250223
Arise then_ and improve this spring-time. Come away from the world and the flesh_ come into fellowship with Christ_ 1 Cor.,20250223
Arise_ shine_ for thy light has come (Isa. lx. 1); walk in that light_ Isa. ii,20250223
As Christ shows the absurdity and wickedness of those children who think it is no duty_ in some cases_ to maintain their parents (Matt. xv. so Solomon here shows the absurdity and wickedness of those who think it is no sin to rob their parents_ either by force or secretly_ by wheedling them or threatening them_ or by wasting what they have_ and (which is no better than robbing them) running into debt and leaving them to pay it. Now,20250223
As I was in the days of my youth_ when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle,20250223
As a counsellor. A man of understanding in these precepts of wisdom_ by comparing them with one another and with his own observations_ shall by degrees attain unto wise counsels; he stands fair for preferment_ and will be consulted as an oracle_ and entrusted with the management of public affairs; he shall come to sit at the helm_ so the word signifies. Note_ Industry is the way to honour; and those whom God has blessed with wisdom must study to do good with it_ according as their sphere is. It is more dignity indeed to be counsellor to the prince_ but it is more charity to be counsellor to the poor_ as Job was with his wisdom. Job xxix. 15_ I was eyes to the blind,20250223
As a covetous man causes his eyes to fly upon the wealth of this world_ which he is greedy of_ so this great beast is said to snatch_ or draw up_ even a river with his eyes. ,20250223
As a distempered man_ sorely and grievously distempered both in body and mind. In this part of his representation is he is very peevish_ as if God dealt hardly with him and laid upon him more than was meet: __Am I a sea_ or a whale (v. a raging sea_ that must be kept within bounds_ to check its proud waves_ or an unruly whale_ that must be restrained by force from devouring all the fishes of the sea? Am I so strong that there needs so much ado to hold me? so boisterous that no less than all these mighty bonds of affliction will serve to tame me and keep me within compass?__ We are very apt_ when we are in affliction_ to complain of God and his providence_ as if he laid more restraints upon us that there is occasion for; whereas we are never in heaviness but when there is need_ nor more than the necessity demands. 1. He complains that he could not rest in his bed_ v. 13_ 14. There we promise ourselves some repose_ when we are fatigued with labour_ pain_ or traveling: __My bed shall comfort me_ and my couch shall ease my complaint. Sleep will for a time give me some relief;__ it usually does so; it is appointed for that end; many a time it has eased us_ and we have awaked refreshed_ and with new vigour. When it is so we have great reason to be thankful; but it was not so with poor Job: his bed_ instead of comforting him_ terrified him; and his couch_ instead of easing his complaint_ added to it; for if he dropped asleep_ he was disturbed with frightful dreams_ and when those awaked him still he was haunted with dreadful apparitions. This was it that made the night so unwelcome and wearisome to him as it was (v. 4): When shall I arise? Note_ God can_ when he pleases_ meet us with terror even where we promise ourselves ease and repose; nay_ he can make us a terror to ourselves_ and_ as we have often contracted guilt by the rovings of an unsanctified fancy_ he can likewise_ by the power of our own imagination_ create us much grief_ and so make that our punishment which has often been our sin. In Job's dreams_ though they might partly arise from his distemper (in fevers_ or small pox_ when the body is all over sore_ it is common for the sleep to be unquiet)_ yet we have reason to think Satan had a hand_ for he delights to terrify those whom it is out of his reach to destroy; but Job looked up to God_ who permitted Satan to do this (thou scarest me)_ and mistook Satan's representations for the terror of God setting themselves in array against him. We have reason to pray to God that our dreams may neither defile nor disquiet us_ neither tempt us to sin nor torment us with fear_ that he who keeps,20250223
As a lily among thorns_ as a lily compared with thorns. The church of Christ as far excels all other societies as a bed of roses excels a bush of thorns. As a lily compassed with thorns. The wicked_ the daughters of this world_ such as have no love to Christ_ are as thorns_ worthless and useless_ good for nothing but to stop a gap; nay_ they are noxious and hurtful; they came in with sin and are a fruit of the curse; they choke good seed_ and hinder good fruit_ and their end is to be burned. God's people are as lilies among them_ scratched and torn_ shaded and obscured_ by them; they are dear to Christ_ and yet exposed to hardships and troubles in the world; they must expect it_ for they are planted among thorns (Ezek. ii. but they are nevertheless dear to him; he does not overlook nor undervalue any of his lilies for their being among thorns_ When they are among thorns they must still be as lilies_ must maintain their innocency and purity_ and_ though they are among thorns_ must not be turned into thorns_ must not render railing for railing_ and_ if they thus preserve their character_ they shall be still owned as conformable to Christ. Grace in the soul is a lily among thorns; corruptions are thorns in the flesh (2 Cor. xii. are as Canaanites to God's Israel (Josh. xxiii. 13); but the lily that is now among thorns shall shortly be transplanted out of this wilderness into that paradise where there is no pricking brier nor grieving thorn_ Ezek.,20250223
As a man that made no conscience of what he said—a liar_ and one that hoped by the impudence of lies to silence his adversaries (should thy lies make men hold their peace?)—a mocker_ one that bantered all mankind_ and knew how to put false colours upon any thing_ and was not ashamed to impose upon every one that talked with him: When thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed? Is it not time to speak_ to stem such a violent tide as this? Job was not mad_ but spoke the words of truth and soberness_ and yet was thus misrepresented. Eliphaz and Bildad had answered him_ and said what they could to make him ashamed; it was therefore no instance of Zophar's generosity to set upon a man so violently who was already thus harassed. Here were three matched against one.,20250223
As a man that never considered what he said_ but uttered what came uppermost_ only to make a noise with the multitude of words_ hoping by that means to carry his cause and run down his reprovers: Should not the multitude of words be answered? Truly_ sometimes it is no great matter whether it be or no; silence perhaps is the best confutation of impertinence and puts the greatest contempt upon it. Answer not a fool according to his folly. But_ if it be answered_ let reason and grace have the answering of it_ not pride and passion. Should a man full of talk (margin_ a man of lips_ that is all tongue_ vox et præterea nihil—mere voice) be justified? Should he be justified in his loquacity_ as in effect he is if he be not reproved for it? No_ for in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin. Should he be justified by it? Shall many words pass for valid pleas? Shall he carry the day with the flourishes of language? No_ he shall not be accepted with God_ or any wise men_ for his much speaking_ Matt. vi. 7,20250223
As a passionate complaint of hard usage_ that he was punished for his faults and yet was not told what his faults were. Or_ 2. As a prudent appeal to God from the censures of his friends. He desired that all his sins might be brought to light_ as knowing they would then appear not so many_ nor so mighty_ as his friends suspected him to be guilty of. Or_ 3. As a pious request_ to the same purport with that which Elihu directed him to_ ch. xxxiv,20250223
As a passionate reflection upon the proceedings of divine justice; as if the great God did diminish and disparage himself in contending with man. __Great men think it below them to take cognizance of those who are much their inferiors so far as to reprove and correct their follies and indecencies; why then does God magnify man_ by visiting him_ and trying him_ and making so much ado about him? Why will he thus pour all his forces upon one that is such an unequal match for him? Why will he visit him with afflictions_ which_ like a quotidian ague_ return as duly and constantly as the morning light_ and try_ every moment_ what he can bear?__ We mistake God_ and the nature of his providence_ if we think it any lessening to him to take notice of the meanest of his creatures. Or_ 2. As a pious admiration of the condescensions of divine grace_ like that_ Ps. viii. 4; cxliv,20250223
As a reason why we should_ under our afflictions_ enquire after God our Maker_ and seek unto him. This is the greatest excellency of reason_ that it makes us capable of religion_ and it is in that especially that we are taught more than the beasts and the fowls. They have wonderful instincts and sagacities in seeking out their food_ their physic_ their shelter; but none of them are capable of enquiring_ Where is God my Maker? Something like logic_ and philosophy_ and politics_ has been observed among the brute-creatures_ but never any thing of divinity or religion; these are peculiar to man. If therefore the oppressed only cry by reason of the arm of the mighty_ and do not look up to God_ they do no more than the brutes (who complain when they are hurt)_ and they forget that instruction and wisdom by which they are advanced so far above them. God relieves the brute-creatures because they cry to him according to the best of their capacity_ ch. xxxviii. 41; Ps. civ,20250223
As a reasonable creature_ that has the faculty of contriving for himself: His heart devises his way_ designs an end_ and projects ways and means leading to that end_ which the inferior creatures_ who are governed by sense and natural instinct_ cannot do. The more shame for him if he do not devise the way how to please God and provide for his everlasting state,20250223
As a safe_ pleasant_ comfortable way. ,20250223
As a straight_ plain_ easy way; it is the way of righteousness. God's commands (the rule we are to walk by) are all holy_ just_ and good. Religion has right reason and equity on its side; it is a path-way_ a way which God has cast up for us (Isa. xxxv. 8); it is a highway_ the king's highway_ the King of kings' highway_ a way which is tracked before us by all the saints_ the good old way_ full of the footsteps of the flock,20250223
As a witness: __Never bear a testimony against any man without cause_ unless what thou sayest thou knowest to be punctually true and thou hast a clear call to testify it. Never bear a false testimony against any one;__ for it follows_ __Deceive not with thy lips; deceive not the judge and jury_ deceive not those whom thou conversest with_ into an ill opinion of thy neighbour. When thou speakest of thy neighbour do not only speak that which is true_ but take heed lest_ in the manner of thy speaking_ thou insinuate any thing that is otherwise and so shouldst deceive by innuendos or hyperboles.__ Or_ 2. As a plaintiff or prosecutor. If there be occasion to bring an action or information against thy neighbour_ let it not be from a spirit of revenge. __Say not_ I am resolved I will be even with him: I will do so to him as he had done to me.__ Even a righteous cause becomes unrighteous when it is thus prosecuted with malice. Say not_ I will render to the man according to his work_ and make him pay dearly for it; for it is God's prerogative to do so_ and we must leave it to him_ and not step into his throne_ or take his work out of his hands. If we will needs be our own carvers_ and judges in our own cause_ we forfeit the benefit of an appeal to God's tribunal; therefore we must not avenge ourselves_ because he has said_ Vengeance is mine.,20250223
As all our knowledge must take rise from the fear of God_ so it must tend to it as its perfection and centre. Those know enough who know how to fear God_ who are careful in every thing to please him and fearful of offending him in any thing; this is the Alpha and Omega of knowledge.,20250223
As always in death_ so sometimes in life_ the righteous are remarkably favoured and the wicked crossed. 1. Good people are helped out of the distresses which they thought themselves lost in_ and their feet are set in a large room_ Ps. lxvi. 12; xxxiv,20250223
As an interpreter (v. 6)—to understand a proverb. Solomon was himself famous for expounding riddles and resolving hard questions_ which was of old the celebrated entertainment of the eastern princes_ witness the solutions he gave to the enquiries with which the queen of Sheba thought to puzzle him. Now here he undertakes to furnish his readers with that talent_ as far as would be serviceable to the best purposes. __They shall understand a proverb_ even the interpretation_ without which the proverb is a nut uncracked; when they hear a wise saying_ though it be figurative_ they shall take the sense of it_ and know how to make use of it.__ The words of the wise are sometimes dark sayings. In St. Paul's epistles there is that which is hard to be understood; but to those who_ being well-versed in the scriptures_ know how to compare spiritual things with spiritual_ they will be easy and safe; so that_ if you ask them_ Have you understood all these things? they may answer_ Yea_ Lord. Note_ It is a credit to religion when men of honesty are men of sense; all good people therefore should aim to be intelligent_ and run to and fro_ take pains in the use of means_ that their knowledge may be increased.,20250223
As assuming to himself such knowledge as none else had: __Dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself_ as if none were wise besides?__ Job had said (ch. xiii.,20250223
As checking him for his vainglorious boasting in the multitude of his words_ what he will do and what he will have_ not considering that which every body knows that a man cannot tell what shall be in his own time_ while he lives (Prov. xxvii. 1)_ much less can one tell what shall be after him_ when he is dead and gone. Would we duly consider our own ignorance of_ and uncertainty about_ future events_ it would cut off a great many of the idle words we foolishly multiply. Or_ ,20250223
As confused dreams_ frightful and perplexed_ and such as disturb the sleep_ are an evidence of a hurry of business which fills our head_ so many words and hasty ones_ used in prayer_ are an evidence of folly reigning in the heart_ ignorance of and unacquaintedness with both God and ourselves_ low thoughts of God_ and careless thoughts of our own souls. Even in common conversation a fool is known by the multitude of words; those that know least talk most (ch. x. particularly in devotion; there_ no doubt_ a prating fool shall fall (Prov. x. 8_ shall fall short of acceptance. Those are fools indeed who think they shall be heard_ in prayer_ for their much speaking.,20250223
As day-labourers_ that have the work of the day to do in its day and must make up their account at night.,20250223
As designed to prove Job a hypocrite and a wicked man_ though not by the greatness_ yet the by the continuance_ of his afflictions. __When thou wast impoverished_ and thy children were killed_ if thou hadst been pure and upright_ and approved thyself so in the trial_ God would before now have returned in mercy to thee and comforted thee according to the time of thy affliction; but_ because he does not so_ we have reason to conclude thou art not so pure and upright as thou pretendest to be. If thou hadst conducted thyself well under the former affliction_ thou wouldst not have been struck with the latter.__ Herein Bildad was not in the right; for a good man may be afflicted for his trial_ not only very sorely_ but very long_ and yet_ if for life_ it is in comparison with eternity but for a moment. But_ since Bildad put it to this issue_ God was pleased to join issue with him_ and proved his servant Job an honest man by Bildad's own argument; for_ soon after_ he blessed his latter end more than his beginning. Or_ 2. As designed to direct and encourage Job_ that he might not thus run himself into despair_ and give up all for gone; there might yet be hope if he would take the right course. I am apt to think Bildad here intended to condemn Job_ yet would be thought to counsel and comfort him. ,20250223
As faithful sayings_ which he might be confident of the truth of: __Lo_ this we have searched_ and so it is. We have indeed received these things by tradition from our fathers_ but we have not taken them upon trust; we have carefully searched them_ have compared spiritual things with spiritual_ have diligently studied them_ and been confirmed in our belief of them from our own observation and experience; and we are all of a mind that so it is.__ Truth is a treasure that is well worth digging for_ diving for; and then we shall know both how to value it ourselves and how to communicate it to others when we have taken pains in searching for it. ,20250223
As for that night too_ let it want the benefit of moon and stars_ and let darkness seize upon it_ thick darkness_ darkness that may be felt_ which will not befriend the repose of the night by its silence_ but rather disturb it with its terrors.,20250223
As for the earth_ out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 7 There is a path which no fowl knoweth_ and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:,20250223
As for the sin of stealing_ if a man were brought to it by extreme necessity_ if he stole meat for the satisfying of his soul when he was hungry_ though that will not excuse him from guilt_ yet it is such an extenuation of his crime that men do not despise him_ do not expose him to ignominy_ but pity him. Hunger will break through stone-walls_ and blame will be laid upon those that brought him to poverty_ or that did not relieve him. Nay_ though he have not that to say in his excuse_ if he be found stealing_ and the evidence be ever so plain upon him_ yet he shall only make restitution seven-fold. The law of Moses appointed that he who stole a sheep should restore four-fold_ and an ox five-fold (Exod. xxii. 1); accordingly David adjudged_ 2 Sam. xii,20250223
As goods are increased care about them is increased_ and those are increased that eat of them_ and a little thing will embitter all the comfort of them; and then what profit has a man of all his labour? Early up_ and never the nearer. ,20250223
As he will not punish the innocent_ so he will not exact of those that are guilty more than their iniquities deserve; and of the proportion between the sin and the punishment Infinite Wisdom shall be the judge. He will not give any man cause to complain that he deals hardly with him_ nor shall any man enter into judgment with God_ or bring an action against him. If he do_ God will be justified when he speaks and clear when he judges. Therefore Job was very much to be blamed for his complaints of God_ and is here well-advised to let fall his action_ for he would certainly be cast or non-suited. It is not for man ever to purpose to enter into judgment with the Omnipotent; so some read the whole verse. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. Elihu asks_ __To what purpose? The judgment already given concerning thee will certainly be affirmed; no errors can be found in it_ nor any exceptions taken to it_ but_ after all_ it must rest as it is.__ All is well that God does_ and will be found so. To prove that when God destroys the mighty men_ and strikes them as wicked men_ he does not lay upon them more than right_ he shows what their wickedness was (v. 27_ 28); and let any compare that with their punishment_ and then judge whether they did not deserve it. In short_ these unjust judges_ whom God will justly judge_ neither feared God nor regarded man_ Luke xviii,20250223
As his Judge. He considered_ __If I should be imperious and severe with my servants_ what then shall I do when God riseth up?__ He considered that he had a Master in heaven_ to whom he was accountable_ who will rise up and will visit; and we are concerned to consider what we shall do in the day of his visitation (Isa. x. and_ considering that we should be undone if God should then be strict and severe with us_ we ought to be very mild and gentle towards all with whom we have to do. Consider what would become of us if God should be extreme to mark what we do amiss_ should take all advantages against us and insist upon all his just demands from us—if he should visit every offence_ and take every forfeiture—if he should always chide_ and keep his anger for ever. And let not us be rigorous with our inferiors. Consider what will become of us if we be cruel and unmerciful to our brethren. The cries of the injured will be heard; the sins of the injurious will be punished. Those that showed no mercy shall find none; and what shall we do then? ,20250223
As his and his servants' Creator_ v,20250223
As if he despaired of obtaining from God any relief or redress of his grievances_ though he should produce ever so good proofs of his integrity: __I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. My afflictions have continued so long upon me_ and increased so fast_ that I do not expect thou wilt ever clear up my innocency by delivering me out of them and restoring me to a prosperous condition. Right or wrong_ I must be treated as a wicked man; my friends will continue to think so of me_ and God will continue upon me the afflictions which give them occasion to think so. Why then do I labour in vain to clear myself and maintain my own integrity?__ v,20250223
As if he despaired to have a fair hearing with God_ and that were hard indeed. ,20250223
As if he were cruel_ and his wrath as relentless as his power was resistless. As if he contrived to touch him in the tenderest part_ cleaving his reins asunder with acute pains; perhaps they were nephritic pains_ those of the stone_ which lie in the region of the kidneys. As if he had no mercy in reserve for him_ he does not spare nor abate any thing of the extremity. And as if he aimed at nothing but his death_ and his death in the midst of the most grievous tortures: He pours out my gall upon the ground_ as when men have taken a wild beast_ and killed it_ they open it_ and pour out the gall with a loathing of it. He thought his blood was poured out_ as if it were not only not precious_ but nauseous,20250223
As if he were furious. Though fury is not in God_ he thought it was_ when he took him by the neck (as a strong man in a passion would take a child) and shook him to pieces_ triumphing in the irresistible power he had to do what he would with him,20250223
As if he were partial. __He has distinguished me from the rest of mankind by this hard usage of me: He has set me up for his mark_ the butt at which he is pleased to let fly all his arrows: at me they are directed_ and they come not by chance; against me they are levelled_ as if I were the greatest sinner of all the men of the east or were singled out to be made an example.__ When God set him up for a mark his archers presently compassed him round. God has archers at command_ who will be sure to hit the mark that he sets up. Whoever are our enemies_ we must look upon them as God's archers_ and see him directing the arrow. It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good,20250223
As if he were unreasonable and insatiable in his executions (v. 14): __He breaketh me with breach upon breach_ follows me with one wound after another.__ So his troubles came at first; while one messenger of evil tidings was speaking another came: and so it was still; new boils were rising every day_ so that he had no prospect of the end of his troubles. Thus he thought that God ran upon him like a giant_ whom he could not possibly stand before or confront; as the giants of old ran down all their poor neighbours_ and were too hard for them. Note_ Even good men_ when they are in great and extraordinary troubles_ have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of God.,20250223
As it does not run in the blood_ and so come to us by descent_ so it cannot be got for money_ nor does it come to us by purchase. Spiritual gifts are conferred without money and without price_ because no money can be a price for them. Wisdom is likewise a more valuable gift to him that has it_ makes him richer and happier_ than gold or precious stones. It is better to get wisdom than gold. Gold is another's_ wisdom our own; gold is for the body and time_ wisdom for the soul and eternity. Let that which is most precious in God's account be so in ours. See Prov. iii. 14_ &c.,20250223
As it has been_ so it is likely to be still: Those that come after will be of the same spirit_ and shall not long rejoice in him whom at first they seemed extremely fond of. To-day_ Hosanna—tomorrow_ Crucify,20250223
As it is one of the greatest grievances of poverty that it exposes to contempt_ so it is none of the least supports to the poor to be respected. ,20250223
As long as he pleases he preserves the settled course and order of nature; and this is a continued creation. He himself alone_ by his own power_ and without the assistance of any other_,20250223
As men's seeking the Lord is a good sign that they do understand much_ so it is a good means of their understanding more_ even of their understanding all things needful for them. Those that set God's glory before them as their end_ his favour as their felicity_ and his word as their rule_ and apply to him upon all occasions by prayer_ they seek the Lord_ and he will give them the spirit of wisdom. If a man do his will_ he shall know his doctrine_ John vii,20250223
As mocking him for his tautologies. He is full of words_ for if he do but speak the most trite and common thing_ a man cannot tell what shall be_ because he loves to hear himself talk_ he will say it again_ what shall be after him who can tell him? like Battus in Ovid:,20250223
As one that truly desired to find it. This is a question we should all put. While the most of men are asking_ __Where shall money be found?__ we should ask_ Where may wisdom be found? that we may seek it and find it_ not vain philosophy_ or carnal policy_ but true religion; for that is the only true wisdom_ that is it which best improves our faculties and best secures our spiritual and eternal welfare. This is that which we should cry after and dig for_ Prov. ii. 3_ 4,20250223
As one that utterly despaired of finding it any where but in God_ and any way but by divine revelation: It is not found in this land of the living_ v,20250223
As opposing the stream of antiquity_ a venerable name_ under the shade of which all contending parties strive to shelter themselves: __With us are the gray-headed and very aged men_ v,20250223
As our fruit is_ so will our food be_ Rom. vi. 21_ 22.,20250223
As ravenous beasts_ so ravenous birds_ are fed by the divine Providence. Who but God provides for the raven his food? Man does not; he takes care only of those creatures that are_ or may be_ useful to him. But God has a regard to all the works of his hands_ even the meanest and least valuable. The ravens' young ones are in a special manner necessitous_ and God supplies them_ Ps. cxlvii,20250223
As religion towards God is a branch of universal righteousness (he is not an honest man that is not devout)_ so righteousness towards men is a branch of true religion_ for he is not a godly man that is not honest_ nor can he expect that his devotion should be accepted; for,20250223
As seemingly delightful places. Lebanon is called that goodly mountain_ Deut. iii,20250223
As sinners never think they have sin enough till it brings them to hell_ so saints never think they have grace enough till it brings them to heaven.,20250223
As sitting in the seat of the scornful: __He drinketh up scorning like water___ that is_ __he takes a great deal of liberty to reproach both God and his friends_ takes a pleasure in so doing_ and is very liberal in his reflections.__ Or_ __He is very greedy in receiving and hearkening to the scorns and contempts which others cast upon their brethren_ is well pleased with them and extols them.__ Or_ as some explain it_ __By these foolish expressions of his he makes himself the object of scorn_ lays himself very open to reproach_ and gives occasion to others to laugh at him; while his religion suffers by them_ and the reputation of that is wounded through his side.__ We have need to pray that God will never leave us to ourselves to say or do any thing which may make us a reproach to the foolish_ Ps. xxxix,20250223
As soldiers_ exposed to hardship and in the midst of enemies; we must serve and be under command; and_ when our warfare is accomplished_ we must be disbanded_ dismissed with either shame or honour_ according to what we have done in the body. ,20250223
As some are given to appetite (v. 2) so others to covetousness_ and those Solomon here takes to task. Men cheat themselves as much by setting their hearts on money (though it seems most substantial) as by setting them on dainties. Observe_,20250223
As that which enabled him to pass a judgment upon what they had said. He had observed what they aimed at_ and therefore knew what to say to it. Let us be thoroughly apprized of the sentiments of our brethren before we censure them; for he that answers a matter before he hears it_ or when he has heard it only by halves_ it is folly and shame to him_ and bespeaks him both impertinent and imperious.,20250223
As that which entitled him to a liberty of speech in his turn and empowered him to require their attention. Hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim—This liberty we mutually allow and ask. Those that have heard may speak_ and those that have learned may teach. ,20250223
As that which furnishes us with matter for thanksgiving_ even under the heaviest burden of affliction. Whatever we are deprived of_ we have our immortal souls_ those jewels of more worth than all the world_ continued to us; even those that kill the body cannot hurt them. And if our affliction prevail not to disturb the exercise of their faculties_ but we enjoy the use of our reason and the peace of our consciences_ we have much reason to be thankful_ how pressing soever our calamities otherwise are. ,20250223
As that which he desired to inculcate both upon others and upon himself_ to have it ready_ and to make use of it upon all occasions. We see it daily proved; let it therefore be daily improved: Vanity of vanities_ all is vanity.,20250223
As that which he had fully demonstrated the truth of_ and so made good his undertaking in this sermon_ wherein he had kept closely to his text_ and both his reasons and his application were to the purpose,20250223
As that which might give some advantage to what he wrote_ for where the word of a king is there is power. He thought it no disparagement to him_ as a king_ to be a preacher; but the people would regard him the more as a preacher because he was a king. If men of honour would lay out themselves to do good_ what a great deal of good might they do! Solomon looked as great in the pulpit_ preaching the vanity of the world_ as in his throne of ivory_ judging.,20250223
As that which others would infer from the doctrine he maintained. __If this be true__ (thinks Eliphaz) __which Job says_ that a man may be thus sorely afflicted and yet be a good man_ then farewell all religion_ farewell prayer and the fear of God. If all things come alike to all_ and the best men may have the worst treatment in this world_ every one will be ready to say_ It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it to keep his ordinances? Mal. iii,20250223
As that which was a very great aggravation of his sin. He was a king. God had done much for him_ in raising him to the throne_ and yet he had so ill requited him; his dignity made the bad example and influence of his sin the more dangerous_ and many would follow his pernicious ways; especially as he was king of Jerusalem_ the holy city_ where God's temple was_ and of his own building too_ where the priests_ the Lord's ministers_ were_ and his prophets who had taught him better things. ,20250223
As that which was his own practice. He thought that Job talked of God with such liberty as if he had been his equal_ and that he charged him so vehemently with hard usage of him_ and challenged him so often to a fair trial_ that he had quite thrown off all religious regard to him. This charge was utterly false_ and yet wanted not some colour. We ought not only to take care that we keep up prayer and the fear of God_ but that we never drop any unwary expressions which may give occasion to those who seek occasion to question our sincerity and constancy in religion. Or_ ,20250223
As that which we are intimately acquainted and conversant with (v. 4): __Say unto wisdom_ Thou art my sister_ whom I dearly love and take delight in; and call understanding thy kinswoman_ to whom thou art nearly allied_ and for whom thou hast a pure affection; call her thy friend_ whom thou courtest.__ We must make the word of God familiar to us_ consult it_ and consult its honour_ and take a pleasure in conversing with it,20250223
As that which we are most careful of. We must keep it as our treasure; we must lay up God's commandments with us_ lay them up safely_ that we may not be robbed of them by the wicked one_,20250223
As that which we are most tender of: Keep my law as the apple of thy eye. A little thing offends the eye_ and therefore nature has so well guarded it. We pray_ with David_ that God would keep us as the apple of his eye (Ps. xvii. that our lives and comforts may be precious in his sight; and they shall be so (Zech. ii. 8) if we be in like manner tender of his law and afraid of the least violation of it. Those who reproach strict and circumspect walking_ as needless preciseness_ consider not that the law is to be kept as the apple of the eye_ for indeed it is the apple of our eye; the law is light; the law in the heart is the eye of the soul,20250223
As that which we are proud of and would be ever mindful of (v. 3): __Bind them upon thy fingers; let them be precious to thee; look upon them as an ornament_ as a diamond-ring_ as the signet on thy right hand; wear them continually as thy wedding-ring_ the badge of thy espousals to God. Look upon the word of God as putting an honour upon thee_ as an ensign of thy dignity. Bind them on thy fingers_ that they may be constant memorandums to thee of thy duty_ that thou mayest have them always in view_ as that which is graven upon the palms of thy hands.__ 4. As that which we are fond of and are ever thinking of: Write them upon the table of thy heart_ as the names of the friends we dearly love_ we say_ are written in our hearts. let the word of God dwell richly in us_ and be written there where it will be always at hand to be read. Where sin was written (Jer. xvii. 1) let the word of God be written. It is the matter of a promise (Heb. viii. 10_ I will write my law in their hearts)_ which makes the precept practicable and easy,20250223
As that which we make use of for our defence and armour_ to keep us from the strange woman_ from sin_ that flattering but destroying thing_ that adulteress; particularly from the sin of uncleanness_ v,20250223
As that which will be absolutely needful. Our mouth is continually craving it of us; the necessities both of soul and body are pressing_ and require constant relief_ so that we must either work or starve. Both call for daily bread_ and therefore there must be daily labour; for in the sweat of our face we must eat_ 2 Thess. iii. 10,20250223
As that which will be unspeakably gainful. We know on whose errand we go: He that labours shall reap the fruit of his labour; it shall be for himself; he shall rejoice in his own work and eat the labour of his hands. If we make religion our business_ God will make it our blessedness.,20250223
As the evil spirit often steals good words out of the heart (Matt. xiii. so the good Spirit sometimes steals good words into the heart_ or ever we are aware,20250223
As the longest day will have its night_ so the longest night will have its morning. ,20250223
As the names of his pupils_ whom he instructed_ or who consulted him as an oracle_ having a great opinion of his wisdom and goodness. Probably they wrote from him what he dictated_ as Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah_ and by their means it was preserved_ as they were ready to attest it to be his_ for it was spoken to them; they were two witnesses of it. Or_ 2. As the subject of his discourse. Ithiel signifies God with me_ the application of Immanuel_ God with us. The word calls him God with us; faith appropriates this_ and calls him __God with me_ who loved me_ and gave himself for me_ and into union and communion with whom I am admitted.__ Ucal signifies the Mighty One_ for it is upon one that is mighty that help is laid for us. Many good interpreters therefore apply this to the Messiah_ for to him all the prophecies bear witness_ and why not this then? It is what Agur spoke concerning Ithiel_ even concerning Ithiel (that is the name on which the stress is laid) with us_ Isa. vii. 14.,20250223
As the prevalency of men's lusts is owing to the darkness of their understandings_ so the darkness of their understandings is very much owing to the dominion of their lusts: Men understand not judgment_ discern not between truth and falsehood_ right and wrong; they understand not the law of God as the rule either of their duty or of their doom; and,20250223
As the sluggard's argument for the excuse of himself in his idleness. He folds his hands together_ and abuses and misapplies a good truth for his justification_ as if_ because a little with quietness is better than abundance with strife_ therefore a little with idleness is better than abundance with honest labour: thus wise in his own conceit is he_ Prov. xxvi,20250223
As the spiritual life was begun by the word as the instrument of it_ so by the same word it is still nourished and maintained. We could not live without it; we may by faith live upon it. ,20250223
As therein unkind to his family_ for he entails a curse upon it. This is a crime so heinous that it shall be punished_ not only in his person_ but in his posterity_ for whom he thus treasures up wrath. The sword shall not depart from David's house because he rewarded Uriah with evil for his good services. The Jews stoned Christ for his good works; therefore is his blood upon them and upon their children.,20250223
As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit_ nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. 6 In the morning sow thy seed_ and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper_ either this or that_ or whether they both shall be alike good.,20250223
As to himself_ a sinful condition is a wasteful condition. How many of the good gifts both of nature and Providence does one sinner destroy and make waste of—good sense_ good parts_ good learning_ a good disposition_ a good estate_ good meat_ good drink_ and abundance of God's good creatures_ all made use of in the service of sin_ and so destroyed and lost_ and the end of giving them frustrated and perverted! He who destroys his own soul destroys much good. ,20250223
As to others_ what a great deal of mischief may one wicked man do in a town or country! One sinner_ who makes it his business to debauch others_ may defeat and frustrate the intentions of a great many good laws and a great deal of good preaching_ and draw many into his pernicious ways; one sinner may be the ruin of a town_ as one Achan troubled the whole camp of Israel. The wise man who delivered the city would have had his due respect and recompence for it but that some one sinner hindered it_ and invidiously diminished the service. And many a good project_ well laid for the public welfare_ had been destroyed by some one subtle adversary to it. The wisdom of some would have healed the nation_ but_ through the wickedness of a few_ it would not be healed. See who are a kingdom's friends and enemies_ if one saint does much good_ and one sinner destroys much good.,20250223
As to saints_ it will engage them to proceed and persevere in their righteousness_ and yet will be an admonition to them to take heed of running into extremes: A just man may perish in his righteousness_ but let him not_ by his own imprudence and rash zeal_ pull trouble upon his own head_ and then reflect upon Providence as dealing hardly with him. __Be not righteous overmuch_,20250223
As to sinners_ if it cannot prevail with them to forsake their sins_ yet it may restrain them from growing very exorbitant. It is true there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness (v. 15); but let none say that therefore they may safely be as wicked as they will; no_ be not overmuch wicked (v. 17); do not run to an excess of riot. Many that will not be wrought upon by the fear of God_ and a dread of the torments of hell_ to avoid all sin_ will yet_ if they have ever so little consideration_ avoid those sins that ruin their health and estate_ and expose them to public justice. And Solomon here makes use of these considerations. __The magistrate bears not the sword in vain_ has a quick eye and a heavy hand_ and is a terror to evil-doers; therefore be afraid of coming within his reach_ be not so foolish as to lay thyself open to the law_ why shouldst thou die before thy time?__ Solomon_ in these two cautions_ had probably a special regard to some of his own subjects that were disaffected to his government and were meditating the revolt which they made immediately after his death. Some_ it may be_ quarrelled with the sins of their governor_ and made them their pretence; to them he says_ Be not righteous overmuch. Others were weary of the strictness of the government_ and the temple-service_ and that made them desirous to set up another king; but he frightens both from their seditious practices with the sword of justice_ and others likewise from meddling with those that were given to change.,20250223
As to the body_ and the life that now is_ What profit has a man of all his labour? A man's life consists not in an abundance_ Luke xii,20250223
As to the soul_ and the life that is to come_ we may much more truly say_ What profit has a man of all his labour? All he gets by it will not supply the wants of the soul_ nor satisfy its desires_ will not atone for the sin of the soul_ nor cure its diseases_ nor contervail the loss of it; what profit will they be of to the soul in death_ in judgment_ or in the everlasting state? The fruit of our labour in heavenly things is meat that endures to eternal life_ but the fruit of our labour for the world is only meat that perishes.,20250223
As to their bodies_ the change is altogether the same_ except the different respects that are paid to them by the survivors. Let a man be buried with the burial of an ass (Jer. xxii. 19) and what preëminence then has he above a beast? The touch of the dead body of a man_ by the law of Moses_ contracted a greater ceremonial pollution than the touch of the carcase even of an unclean beast or fowl. And Solomon here observes that all go unto one place; the dead bodies of men and beasts putrefy alike; all are of the dust_ in their original_ for we see all turn to dust again in their corruption. What little reason then have we to be proud of our bodies_ or any bodily accomplishments_ when they must not only be reduced to the earth very shortly_ but must be so in common with the beasts_ and we must mingle our dust with theirs! ,20250223
As to their spirits there is indeed a vast difference_ but not a visible one_ v,20250223
As ungrateful to his friends. He oftentimes is so absurd and insensible of kindnesses done him that he renders evil for good. David met with those that were his adversaries for his love_ Ps. cix,20250223
As unnatural to those about him_ and one that laid not to heart the death of his children and servants_ nor cared how many of them had their skins (as I may say) stripped over their ears_ so long as he slept in a whole skin himself; as if he that was so tender of his children's souls could be careless of their bodies_ and_ like the ostrich_ hardened against his young ones_ as though they were not his,20250223
As very safe and comfortable: It is the way of life_ the way that leads to eternal life_ in which we shall find the joy and satisfaction which will be the life of the soul_ and at the end of which we shall find the perfection of blessedness. Be wise and live. It is the way to escape that misery which we cannot but see ourselves exposed to_ and in danger of. It is to depart from hell beneath_ from the snares of hell_ the temptations of Satan_ and all his wiles_ from the pains of hell_ that everlasting destruction which our sins have deserved,20250223
As very sublime and honourable: It is above. A good man sets his affections on things above_ and deals in those things. His conversation is in heaven; his way leads directly thither; there his treasure is_ above_ out of the reach of enemies_ above the changes of this lower world. A good man is truly noble and great; his desires and designs are high_ and he lives above the common rate of other men. It is above the capacity and out of the sight of foolish men.,20250223
As walking in the course of the ungodly_ and standing in the way of sinners: He goes in company with the workers of iniquity (v. not that in his conversation he did associate with them_ but in his opinion he did favour and countenance them_ and strengthen their hands. If (as it follows_ v. 9_ for the proof of this) it profits a man nothing to delight himself in God_ why should he not lay the reins on the neck of his lusts and herd with the workers of iniquity? He that says_ I have cleansed my hands in vain_ does not only offend against the generation of God's children (Ps. lxxii. 13_ but gratifies his enemies_ and says as they say.,20250223
As we grow in knowledge we grow in all grace_ 2 Pet. iii,20250223
As we read this_ it teaches us a great truth_ that we are not sufficient of ourselves to think or speak any thing of ourselves that is wise and good_ but that all our sufficiency is of God_ who is with the heart and with the mouth_ and works in us both to will and to do_ Phil. ii. 13; Ps. x,20250223
As well worthy of all acceptation_ which he might improve to his great advantage: Hear it_ and know thou it for thy good. It is not enough to hear and know the truth_ but we must improve it_ and be made wiser and better by it_ receive the impressions of it_ and submit to the commanding power of it. Know it for thyself (so the word is)_ with application to thyself_ and thy own case; not only __This is true___ but __this is true concerning me.__ That which we thus hear and know for ourselves we hear and know for our good_ as we are nourished by the meat which we digest. That is indeed a good sermon to us which does us good.,20250223
As wholly selfish_ and minding nothing but his own ease and safety; as if his religion made him sour_ and morose_ and ill-natured. Thus are the ways and people of God often misrepresented by the devil and his agents.,20250223
As wondering what brought him thither. Is Saul among the prophets? Satan among the sons of God? Yes_ for he transforms himself into an angel of light (2 Cor. xi. 13_ and would seem one of them. Note_ It is possible that a man may be a child of the devil and yet be found in the assemblies of the sons of God in this world_ and there may pass undiscovered by men_ and yet be challenged by the all-seeing God. Friend_ how camest thou in hither? Or_ 2. As enquiring what he had been doing before he came thither. The same question was perhaps put to the rest of those that presented themselves before the Lord_ __Whence came you?__ We are accountable to God for all our haunts and all the ways we traverse.,20250223
As wounds (so the text reads it)_ as deep wounds_ deadly wounds_ wounds in the innermost parts of the belly; the venter medius vel infimus—the middle or lower belly_ the thorax or the abdomen_ in either of which wounds are mortal. The words of the tale-bearer wound him of whom they are spoken_ his credit and interest_ and him to whom they are spoken_ his love and charity. They occasion sin to him_ which is a wound to the conscience. Perhaps he seems to slight them_ but they would insensibly_ by alienating his affections from one he ought to love.,20250223
Ask the mariners_ and by them the sea will say_ It is not in me. It can never be got either by trading on the waters or diving into them_ can never be sucked from the abundance of the seas or the treasures hidden in the sand. Where there is a vein for the silver there is no vein for wisdom_ none for grace. Men can more easily break through the difficulties they meet with in getting worldly wealth than through those they meet with in getting heavenly wisdom_ and they will take more pains to learn how to live in this world than how to live for ever in a better world. So blind and foolish has man become that it is in vain to ask him_ Where is the place of wisdom_ and which is the road that leads to it?,20250223
Ask the miners_ and by them the depth will say_ It is not in me_ v,20250223
At death we must bid a final farewell to this world. The body must then be laid where it will lie long_ and the soul adjudged to that state in which it must be for ever. That had need be well done which is to be done but once_ and done for eternity.,20250223
At death: __Thou shalt call my body to the grave_ and my soul to thyself_ and I will answer_ Ready_ Lord_ ready—Coming_ coming; here I am.__ Gracious souls can cheerfully answer death's summons_ and appear to his writ. Their spirits are not forcibly required from them (as Luke xii. but willingly resigned by them_ and the earthly tabernacle not violently pulled down_ but voluntarily laid down_ with this assurance_ __Thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands. Thou hast mercy in store for me_ not only as made by thy providence_ but new-made by thy grace;__ otherwise he that made them will not save them. Note_ Grace in the soul is the work of God's own hands_ and therefore he will not forsake it in this world (Ps. cxxxviii. but will have a desire to it_ to perfect it in the other_ and to crown it with endless glory.,20250223
At other times it is a blessing. It is for his land_ that this may be made fruitful; and_ besides that which is just necessary_ he gives for mercy_ to fatten it and make it more fruitful. See what a necessary dependence we have upon God_ when the very same thing_ according to the proportion in which it is given_ may be either a great judgment or a great mercy_ and without God we cannot have either a shower or a fair gleam.,20250223
At the presence of the Lord the sea flies and the mountains skip_ Ps. cxiv. 3_ 4. See Hab. iii. 6_ &c. A storm furrows the waters_ and does_ as it were_ divide them; and then a calm smites through the waves_ and lays them flat again. See Ps. lxxxix. 9_ 10. Those who think Job lived at_ or after_ the time of Moses_ apply this to the dividing of the Red Sea before the children of Israel_ and the drowning of the Egyptians in it. By his understanding he smiteth through Rahab; so the word is_ and Rahab is often put for Egypt; as Ps. lxxxvii. 4; Isa. li. 9.,20250223
At the resurrection_ __Thou shalt call me out of the grave_ by the voice of the archangel_ and I will answer and come at the call.__ The body is the work of God's hands_ and he will have a desire to that_ having prepared a glory for it. Or_ ,20250223
Atheism and infidelity_ ver. 12-14.,20250223
Austin is mine_ Domine Deus_ quæcunque dixi in his libris de tuo_ agnoscant et tui; et quæ de meo_ et tu ignosce et tui—Lord God_ whatever I have maintained in these books correspondent with what is contained in thine grant that thy people may approve as well as thyself; whatever is but the doctrine of my book forgive thou_ and grant that thy people may forgive it also. I must beg likewise to own_ to the honour of our great Master_ that I have found the work to be its own wages_ and that the more we converse with the word of God the more it is to us as the honey and the honeycomb_ Ps. xix,20250223
Awake_ why sleepest thou? Note_ The experience we have had of Christ's readiness to yield to the importunities of our faith and prayer should encourage us to continue instant in our addresses to him_ to strive more earnestly_ and not to faint. I sought the Lord_ and he heard me_ Ps. xxxiv,20250223
Bad company is a great hindrance to religion. Those that are companions of riotous men_ that choose such for their companions and delight in their conversation_ will certainly be drawn from keeping the law of God and drawn to transgress it_ Ps. cxix. 115,20250223
Bad men are and shall be forgotten_ or spoken of with contempt. When their bodies are putrefying in the grave their names also shall rot. Either they shall not be preserved at all_ but buried in oblivion (no good can be said of them_ and therefore the greatest kindness that can be done them will be to say nothing of them)_ or they shall be loathsome_ and mentioned with detestation_ and that rule of honour_ De mortuis nil nisi bonum—Say nothing to the disadvantage of the dead_ will not protect them. Where the wickedness has been notorious_ and cannot but be mentioned_ it ought to be mentioned with abhorrence.,20250223
Bad men are good for nothing. 1. One can get no good by them: The heart of the wicked is little worth_ and therefore that which comes out of the abundance of his heart cannot be worth much. His principles_ his notions_ his thoughts_ his purposes_ and all the things that fill him_ and affect him_ are worldly and carnal_ and therefore of no value. He that is of the earth speaks of the earth_ and neither understands nor relishes the things of God_ John iii. 31,20250223
Bad men hate their best friends: The blood-thirsty_ all the seed of the old serpent_ who was a murderer from the beginning_ all that inherit his enmity against the seed of the woman_ hate the upright; they seek the ruin of good men because they condemn the wicked world and witness against it. Christ told his disciples that they should be hated of all men. Bloody men do especially hate upright magistrates_ who would restrain and reform them_ and put the laws in execution against them_ and so really do them a kindness,20250223
Be busy_ and that is the true way to be easy. Keep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee. Thou shalt eat the labour of thy hands,20250223
Be it observed_ to the honour of truth_ that sacred thing,20250223
Be it observed_ to the reproach of a vicious young man_ that he hates wisdom; he keeps company with scandalous women_ who will be his ruin_ both in soul and body; he grieves his parents_ and_ like the prodigal son_ devours their living with harlots. Nothing will beggar men sooner than the lusts of uncleanness; and the best preservative from those ruinous lusts is wisdom.,20250223
Be not an excessive eater of flesh. Intemperance must be avoided in meat as well as drink. Be not a luxurious eater of flesh_ not pleased with any thing but what is very nice and delicate_ savoury dishes_ and forced meat. Some take not only a pleasure_ but a pride_ in being curious about their diet_ and_ as they call it_ eating well; as if that were the ornament of a gentleman_ which is really the shame of a Christian_ making a God of the belly. __Be not a wine bibber_ and be not a riotous eater; and therefore_ be not among wine-bibbers nor among riotous eaters; do not give them countenance_ lest thou learn their ways and insensibly fall into those sins_ or at least lose the dread and detestation of them. They covet to have thee among them; for those that are debauched themselves are very desirous to debauch others; therefore do not gratify them_ lest thou endanger thyself.__ He fetches an argument against this sin from the expensiveness of it and its tendency to impoverish men: and if men will not be deterred from it by the ruin it brings on their secular interests_ which lie nearest their hearts_ no marvel that they are not frightened from it by what they are told out of the word of God of the mischief it does them in their spiritual and eternal concerns. The drunkard and the glutton hate to be reformed_ though they are told they shall come to poverty_ nay_ though they are told they shall come to hell. Drunkenness is the cause of drowsiness; it stupefies men_ and makes them inattentive to business_ and then all goes to wreck and ruin: thus men that have lived creditably come to be clothed with rags,20250223
Be not offended; for_,20250223
Be this thy brazen bulwark of defence_,20250223
Be willing to hear every godly discourse_ and let not the parables of understanding escape thee,20250223
Be you so.__,20250223
Because God hath deprived her of wisdom_ neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 18 What time she lifteth up herself on high_ she scorneth the horse and his rider.,20250223
Because Solomon himself_ with all his possessions_ could aim at no more and desire no better (v. 25): __Who can hasten to this more than I? This is that which I was ambitious of: I wished for no more; and those that have but little_ in comparison with what I have_ may attain to this_ to be content with what they have and enjoy the good of it.__ Yet Solomon could not obtain it by his own wisdom_ without the special grace of God_ and therefore directs us to expect it from the hand of God and pray to him for it. ,20250223
Because all events are now directed by an all-seeing and almighty Providence_ v. 24_ 25. He that governs the world is_ ,20250223
Because all events were from eternity designed and determined by an infallible prescience and immutable decree_ v. 26_ 27. When he settled the course of nature he foreordained all the operations of his government. ,20250223
Because he did not die before his troubles_ that he might never have seen them (Because I was not cut off before the darkness_ v. and yet if_ in the height of his prosperity_ he had received a summons to the grave_ he would have thought it hard. This may help to reconcile us to death_ whenever it comes_ that we do not know what evil we may be taken away from. But when trouble comes it is folly to wish we had not lived to see it and it is better to make the best of it. ,20250223
Because he that resolves against all such suretiship keeps upon sure grounds_ which a man may do if he take care not to launch out any further into business than his own credit will carry him_ so that he needs not ask others to be bound for him.,20250223
Because he was left to live so long in his troubles_ and the darkness was not covered from his face by his being hidden in the grave. We should bear the darkness better than thus if we would but remember that to the upright there sometimes arises a marvellous light in the darkness; however_ there is reserved for them a more marvellous light after it.,20250223
Because his high spirit resented what Job had said as if it had been the greatest affront imaginable. Proud men are apt to think themselves slighted more than really they are,20250223
Because his hot spirit was willing to find a pretence to be hard upon Job. Those that incline to be severe upon others will have it thought that others have first been so upon them.,20250223
Because men's iniquity will be their destruction_ v,20250223
Because men's integrity will be their establishment_ v,20250223
Because of the diffuse fragrancy of his love and the fruits of it (v. 3): __Because of the savour of thy good ointment (the agreeableness and acceptableness of thy graces and comforts to all that rightly understand both them and themselves)_ thy name is as ointment poured forth_ thou art so_ and all that whereby thou hast made thyself known; thy very name is precious to all the saints; it is an ointment and perfume which rejoice the heart.__ The unfolding of Christ's name is as the opening of a box of precious ointment_ which the room is filled with the odour of. The preaching of his gospel was the manifesting the savour of his knowledge in every place_ 2 Cor. ii,20250223
Because of the general affection that all holy souls have to him: Therefore do the virgins love thee. It is Christ's love shed abroad in our hearts that draws them out in love to him; all that are pure from the corruptions of sin_ that preserve the chastity of their own spirits_ and are true to the vows by which they have devoted themselves to God_ that not only suffer not their affections to be violated but cannot bear so much as to be solicited by the world and the flesh_ those are the virgins that love Jesus Christ and follow him whithersoever he goes_ Rev. xiv,20250223
Because of the great esteem she has for his love: Thy love is better than wine. Wine makes glad the heart_ revives the drooping spirits_ and exhilarates them_ but gracious souls take more pleasure in loving Christ and being beloved of him_ in the fruits and gifts of his love and in the pledges and assurances of it_ than any man ever took in the most exquisite delights of sense_ and it is more reviving to them than ever the richest cordial was to one ready to faint. Note_ ,20250223
Because of the pleasure of it. There is a great deal of sweetness in conversing and consulting with a cordial friend. It is like ointment and perfume_ which are very grateful to the smell_ and exhilarate the spirits. It rejoices the heart; the burden of care is made lighter by unbosoming ourselves to our friend_ and it is a great satisfaction to us to have his sentiments concerning our affairs. The sweetness of friendship lies not in hearty mirth_ and hearty laughter_ but in hearty counsel_ faithful advice_ sincerely given and without flattery_ by counsel of the soul (so the word is)_ counsel which reaches the case_ and comes to the heart_ counsel about soul-concerns_ Ps. lxvi,20250223
Because of the profit and advantage of it_ especially in a day of calamity. We are here advised not to go into a brother's house_ not to expect relief from a kinsman merely for kindred-sake_ for the obligation of that commonly goes little further than calling cousin and fails when it comes to the trial of a real kindness_ but rather to apply ourselves to our neighbours_ who are at hand_ and will be ready to help us at an exigence. It is wisdom to oblige them by being neighbourly_ and we shall have the benefit of it in distress_ by finding them so to us_ ch. xviii. 24.,20250223
Because otherwise we affront God; we play the fool with him_ as if we designed to put a trick upon him; and God has no pleasure in fools. More is implied than is expressed; the meaning is_ He greatly abhors such fools and such foolish dealings. Has he need of fools? No; Be not deceived_ God is not mocked_ but will surely and severely reckon with those that thus play fast and loose with him. ,20250223
Because otherwise we wrong ourselves_ we lose the benefit of the making of the vow_ nay_ we incur the penalty for the breach of it; so that it would have been better a great deal not to have vowed_ more safe and more to our advantage_ than to vow and not to pay. Not to have vowed would have been but an omission_ but to vow and not pay incurs the guilt of treachery and perjury; it is lying to God_ Acts v. 4.,20250223
Because riches are a blessing or a curse to a man according as he has or has not a heart to make good use of them. ,20250223
Because there is danger of bringing ourselves into trouble by it_ and our families too when we are gone: He that is surety for a stranger_ for any one that asks him and promises him to be bound for him another time_ for one whose person perhaps he knows_ and thinks he knows his circumstances_ but is mistaken_ he shall smart for it. Contritione conteretur—he shall be certainly and sadly crushed and broken by it_ and perhaps become a bankrupt. Our Lord Jesus was surety for us when we were strangers_ nay_ enemies_ and he smarted for it; it pleased the Lord to bruise him. ,20250223
Before death: he wastes away; he is continually wasting_ dying daily_ spending upon the quick stock of life. Sickness and old age are wasting things to the flesh_ the strength_ the beauty.,20250223
Before old age comes_ which_ if death prevent not_ will come_ and they will be years of which we shall say_ We have no pleasure in them_—when we shall not relish the delights of sense_ as Barzillai,20250223
Before the habitable parts of the world_ which men cultivate_ and reap the profits of (v. the fields in the valleys and plains_ to which the mountains are as a wall_ which are the highest part of the dust of the world; the first part of the dust (so some)_ the atoms which compose the several parts of the world; the chief or principal part of the dust_ so it may be read_ and understood of man_ who was made of the dust of the ground and is dust_ but is the principal part of the dust_ dust enlivened_ dust refined. The eternal Word had a being before man was made_ for in him was the life of men.,20250223
Before the sea was (v. when there were no depths in which the waters were gathered together_ no fountains from which those waters might arise_ none of that deep on which the Spirit of God moved for the production of the visible creation_ Gen. i,20250223
Before we go to pray it is good to consider what we need_ and what the things are which we have to ask of God.—What does our case require? What do our hearts desire? What would we that God should do for us?—that we may not have to seek for our petition and request when we should be presenting it. He begs_ Deny me not before I die. In praying_ we should think of dying_ and pray accordingly. __Lord_ give me pardon_ and peace_ and grace_ before I die_ before I go hence and be no more; for_ if I be not renewed and sanctified before I die_ the work will not be done after; if I do not prevail in prayer before I die_ prayers afterwards will not prevail_ no_ not Lord_ Lord. There is none of this wisdom or working in the grave. Deny me not thy grace_ for_ if thou do_ I die_ I perish; if thou be silent to me_ I am like those that go down to the pit_ Ps. xxviii. 1. Deny me not before I die; as long as I continue in the land of the living_ let me continue under the conduct of thy grace and good providence.__,20250223
Behold him then. Look with pleasure upon Christ in his glory. Look upon him with an eye of faith_ with a fixed eye. Here is a sight worth seeing; behold_ and admire him_ behold_ and love him; look upon him_ and know him again. ,20250223
Behold_ I stand at the door_ and knock. He calls sinners into covenant with him and saints into communion with him. Those whom he loves he will not let alone in their carelessness_ but will find some way or other to awaken them_ to rebuke and chasten them. When we are unmindful of Christ he thinks of us_ and provides that our faith fail not. Peter denied Christ_ but the Lord turned and looked upon him_ and so brought him to himself again. Observe how moving the call is: Open to me_ my sister_ my love. 1. He sues for entrance who may demand it; he knocks who could easily knock the door down,20250223
Behold_ as wild asses in the desert_ go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. 6 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. 7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing_ that they have no covering in the cold. 8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains_ and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast_ and take a pledge of the poor. 10 They cause him to go naked without clothing_ and they take away the sheaf from the hungry,20250223
Behold_ he comes. This may very well be applied to the prospect with the Old-Testament saints had of Christ's coming in the flesh. Abraham saw his day at a distance_ and was glad. The nearer the time came the clearer discoveries were made of it; and those that waited for the consolation of Israel with an eye of faith saw him come_ and triumphed in the sight: Behold_ he comes; for they had heard him say (Ps. xl.,20250223
Being kept from sin_ they are kept from the evil of every trouble.,20250223
Being poor_ he was slighted by the city_ though he was wise and had been an instrument to save them all from ruin: No man remembered that same poor man; his good services were not taken notice of_ no recompence was made him_ no marks of honour were put upon him_ but he lived in as much poverty and obscurity as he had done before. Riches were not to this man of understanding_ nor favour to this man of skill. Many who have well-merited of their prince and country have been ill-paid; such an ungrateful world do we live in. It is well that useful men have a God to trust to_ who will be their bountiful rewarder; for_ among men_ great services are often envied and rewarded with evil for good.,20250223
Being taken well_ it will do good_ and answer the intention. A wise man will be made wiser by the reproofs and instructions that are given him; he will increase in learning_ will grow in knowledge_ and so grow in grace. None must think themselves too wise to learn_ nor so good that they need not be better and therefore need not be taught. We must still press forward_ and follow on to know till we come to the perfect man. Give to a wise man (so it is in the original)_ give him advice_ give him reproof_ give him comfort_ and he will be yet wiser; give him occasion (so the LXX.)_ occasion to show his wisdom_ and he will show it_ and the acts of wisdom will strengthen the habits.,20250223
Being wise_ he served the city_ though he was poor. In their distress they found him out (Judg. xi. 7) and begged his advice and assistance; and he by his wisdom delivered the city_ either by prudent instructions given to the besieged_ directing them to some unthought-of stratagem for their own security_ or by a prudent treaty with the besiegers_ as the woman at Abel_ 2 Sam. xx,20250223
Benefits of Wisdom.,20250223
Better is a handful with quietness than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit_ may be taken either,20250223
Better is it that thou shouldest not vow_ than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. 6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel_ that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice_ and destroy the work of thine hands? 7 For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God. 8 If thou seest the oppression of the poor_ and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province_ marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.,20250223
Bildad (it is probable) from Shuah_ Abraham's son by Keturah_ Gen. xxv,20250223
Bildad began with a rebuke to Job for talking so much_ ch. viii,20250223
Bildad had very disingenuously perverted Job's complaints by making them the description of the miserable condition of a wicked man; and yet he repeats them here_ to move their pity_ and to work upon their good nature_ if they had any left in them.,20250223
Bildad here describes the destruction itself which wicked people are reserved for in the other world_ and which_ in some degree_ often seizes them in this world. Come_ and see what a miserable condition the sinner is in when his day comes to fall.,20250223
Bildad here discourses very well on the sad catastrophe of hypocrites and evil-doers and the fatal period of all their hopes and joys. He will not be so bold as to say with Eliphaz that none that were righteous were ever cut off thus (ch. iv. 7); yet he takes it for granted that God_ in the course of his providence_ does ordinarily bring wicked men_ who seemed pious and were prosperous_ to shame and ruin in this world_ and that_ by making their prosperity short_ he discovers their piety to be counterfeit. Whether this will certainly prove that all who are thus ruined must be concluded to have been hypocrites he will not say_ but rather suspect_ and thinks the application is easy.,20250223
Bildad here makes a very short reply to Job's last discourse_ as one that began to be tired of the cause. He drops the main question concerning the prosperity of wicked men_ as being unable to answer the proofs Job had produced in the foregoing chapter: but_ because he thought Job had made too bold with the divine majesty in his appeals to the divine tribunal (ch. xxiii.)_ he in a few words shows the infinite distance there is between God and man_ teaching us_,20250223
Bildad here shoots his arrows_ even bitter words_ against poor Job_ little thinking that_ though he was a wise and good man_ in this instance he was serving Satan's design in adding to Job's affliction.,20250223
Bildad here_ in the close of his discourse_ sums up what he has to say in a few words_ setting before Job life and death_ the blessing and the curse_ assuring him that as he was so he should fare_ and therefore they might conclude that as he fared so he was. 1. On the one hand_ if he were a perfect upright man_ God would not cast him away_ v,20250223
Bildad is to be commended here for two things:—1. For speaking no more on the subject about which Job and he differed. Perhaps he began to think Job was in the right_ and then it was justice to say no more concerning it_ as one that contended for truth_ not for victory_ and therefore_ for the finding of truth_ would be content to lose the victory; or_ if he still thought himself in the right_ yet he knew when he had said enough_ and would not wrangle endlessly for the last word. Perhaps indeed one reason why he and the rest of them let fall this debate was because they perceived that Job and they did not differ so much in opinion as they thought: they owned that wicked people might prosper a while_ and Job owned they would be destroyed at last; how little then was the difference! If disputants would understand one another better_ perhaps they would find themselves nearer one another than they imagined,20250223
Bildad reproves Job for what he had said (v. checks his passion_ but perhaps (as is too common) with greater passion. We thought Job spoke a great deal of good sense and much to the purpose_ and that he had reason and right on his side; but Bildad_ like an eager angry disputant_ turns it all off with this_ How long wilt thou speak these things? taking it for granted that Eliphaz had said enough to silence him_ and that therefore all he said was impertinent. Thus (as Caryl observes) reproofs are often grounded upon mistakes. Men's meaning is not taken aright_ and then they are gravely rebuked as if they were evil-doers. Bildad compares Job's discourse to a strong wind. Job had excused himself with this_ that his speeches were but as wind (ch. vi. and therefore they should not make such ado about them: __Yea_ but__ (says Bildad) __they are as strong wind_ blustering and threatening_ boisterous and dangerous_ and therefore we are concerned to fence against them.__,20250223
Bildad was a little more rough upon Job_ ch. viii,20250223
Blessed be God_ there is nothing which we have to do which is not plain and easy; the word is nigh us (Prov. viii. 9); but there is a great deal which we would wish to know which is far off_ and exceedingly deep_ among the secret things which belong not to us. And probably it is a culpable ignorance and error that Solomon here laments_ that his pleasures_ and the many amusements of his court_ had blinded his eyes and cast a mist before them_ so that he could not attain to true wisdom as he designed.,20250223
Both Job and his friends took the same way that disputants commonly take_ which is to undervalue one another's sense_ and wisdom_ and management. The longer the saw of contention is drawn the hotter it grows; and the beginning of this sort of strife is as the letting forth of water; therefore leave it off before it be meddled with. Eliphaz had represented Job's discourses as idle_ and unprofitable_ and nothing to the purpose; and Job here gives his the same character. Those who are free in passing such censures must expect to have them retorted; it is easy_ it is endless: but cui bono?—what good does it do? It will stir up men's passions_ but will never convince their judgments_ nor set truth in a clear light. Job here reproves Eliphaz,20250223
Both the just and the wicked_ when their days are fulfilled_ must die. Between their bodies in the grave thee is no visible difference; between the souls of the one and the other_ in the world of spirits_ thee is a vast difference_ and so there is_ or ought to be_ between their memories_ which survive them.,20250223
Both the parts of this verse repeat what has been often said_ but_ on comparing them together_ the sense of them will be enlarged from each other. 1. Be it observed_ to the honour of a virtuous young man_ that he loves wisdom_ he is a philosopher (for that signifies a lover of wisdom)_ for religion is the best philosophy; he avoids bad company_ and especially the company of lewd women. Hereby he rejoices his parents_ and has the satisfaction of being a comfort to them_ and increases his estate_ and is likely to live comfortably,20250223
Both those of the old world and those of Sodom had great plenty of all the delights of sense; for they ate_ they drank_ they bought_ they sold_ &c. (Luke xvii. so that they had no reason to ask what the Almighty could do for them_ for they lived upon his bounty_ no reason to bid him depart from them who had been so kind to them. Many have their houses full of goods but their hearts empty of grace_ and thereby are marked for ruin,20250223
Bounty and liberality. We must not only pity the poor_ but give_ according to their necessity and our ability_ Jam. ii. 15_ 16. That which he has given. Margin_ His deed. It is charity to do for the poor_ as well as to give; and thus_ if they have their limbs and senses_ they may be charitable to one another.,20250223
Bread is not always to the wise; yet he would not therefore be thought either to disparage_ or to discourage_ wisdom_ no_ he still retains his principle_ that wisdom excels folly as much as light excels darkness (ch. ii. and we ought to love and embrace it_ and be governed by it_ for the sake of its own intrinsic worth_ and the capacity it gives us of being serviceable to others_ though we ourselves should not get wealth and preferment by it. This wisdom_ that is_ this which he here describes_ wisdom which enables a man to serve his country out of pure affection to its interests_ when he himself gains no advantage by it_ no_ not so much as thanks for his pains_ or the reputation of it_ this is the wisdom which_ Solomon says_ seemed great unto him_ v,20250223
Brevity and Frailty of Human Life. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Bright thin clouds_ clouds without water; and these he scattereth; they are dispersed of themselves_ and not dissolved into rain_ but what becomes of them we know not. The bright cloud_ in the evening_ when the sky is red_ is scattered_ and proves an earnest of a fair day_ Matt. xvi,20250223
Business is a thing that wise men have pleasure in. They are in their element when they are in their business_ and complain if they be out of business. They may sometimes be tired with their business_ but they are not weary of it_ nor willing to leave it off. Here therefore one would expect to have found the good that men should do_ but Solomon tried this too; after a contemplative life and a voluptuous life_ he betook himself to an active life_ and found no more satisfaction in it than in the other; still it is all vanity and vexation of spirit_ of which he gives an account in these verses_ where observe_,20250223
But I must leave all to the man that shall be after me_ to the generation that comes up in the room of that which is passing away. As there were many before us_ who built the houses that we live in_ and into whose purchases and labours we have entered_ so there shall be many after us_ who shall live in the houses that we build_ and enjoy the fruit of our purchases and labours. Never was land lost for want of an heir. To a gracious soul this is no uneasiness at all; why should we grudge others their turn in the enjoyments of this world_ and not rather be pleased that_ when we are gone_ those that come after us shall fare the better for our wisdom and industry? But to a worldly mind_ that seeks for its own happiness in the creature_ it is a great vexation to think of leaving the beloved pelf behind_ at this uncertainty. ,20250223
But I rather understand this more generally of the turn now given,20250223
But I would strengthen you with my mouth_ and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.,20250223
But Satan grounds upon this an accusation of Job_ slyly representing him,20250223
But Solomon tells us what the reckoning will be_ ver,20250223
But Zophar falls upon him without mercy_ and gives him very bad language: Should a man full of talk be justified? And should thy lies make men hold their peace? Is this the way to comfort Job? No_ nor to convince him neither. Does this become one that appears as an advocate for God and his justice? Tantæne animis coelestibus iræ?—In heavenly breasts can such resentment dwell? Those that engage in controversy will find it very hard to keep their temper. All the wisdom_ caution_ and resolution they have will be little enough to prevent their breaking out into such indecencies as we here find Zophar guilty of.,20250223
But a witness that will be bribed_ and biassed_ and browbeaten_ will utter lies (and not stick nor startle at it)_ with as much readiness and assurance as if what he said were all true.,20250223
But as a depending creature_ that is subject to the direction and dominion of his Maker. If men devise their way_ so as to make God's glory their end and his will their rule_ they may expect that he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace_ so that they shall not miss their way nor come short of their end. But let men devise their worldly affairs ever so politely_ and with ever so great a probability of success_ yet God has the ordering of the event_ and sometimes directs their steps to that which they least intended. The design of this is to teach us to say_ If the Lord will_ we shall live and do this or that (Jam. iv. 14_ and to have our eye to God_ not only in the great turns of our lives_ but in every step we take. Lord_ direct my way_ 1 Thess. iii. 11.,20250223
But he does not awake for thee; therefore thou art not upright. __Well___ says God_ __though your argument be not conclusive_ I will even by that demonstrate the integrity of my servant Job; his latter end shall greatly increase_ and by that it shall appear_ since you will have it so_ that it was not for any injustice in his hands that he suffered the loss of all things.__ Now it appeared that Job had reason to bless God for taking away (as he did_ ch. i. since it made so good a return.,20250223
But he is so far from this that he deals not with us according to the desert_ no_ not of our manifest sins_ which are not found by secret search_ Jer. ii.34. This therefore was the language of Job's melancholy; his sober thoughts never represented God thus as a hard Master. ,20250223
But he should have considered that he and his fellows had provoked him to say that which now they took advantage of; and that was not fair. Those are most effectually condemned that are condemned by themselves_ Tit. iii. 11; Luke xix,20250223
But he that knows his own heart knows so much more evil of himself than he does of any other that he cries out_ __Surely I cannot but think that I am more brutish than any man; surely no man has such a corrupt deceitful heart as I have. I have acted as one that has not the understanding of Adam_ as one that is wretchedly degenerated from the knowledge and righteousness in which man was at first created; nay_ I have not the common sense and reason of a man_ else I should not have done as I have done.__ Agur_ when he was applied to by others as wiser than most_ acknowledged himself more foolish than any. Whatever high opinion others may have of us_ it becomes us to have low thoughts of ourselves,20250223
But hence he infers that God is not affected_ either one way or other_ by any thing that we do. ,20250223
But his case is less dangerous of the two_ and_ though he destroys himself_ he does not create so much sorrow to others as he that winks with his eyes. The dog that bites is not always the dog that barks.,20250223
But how are we to understand this? We are not to think it is unlawful in any case to become surety_ or bail_ for another; it may be a piece of justice or charity; he that has friends may see cause in this instance to show himself friendly_ and it may be no piece of imprudence. Paul became bound for Onesimus_ Philem,20250223
But how then are any young ones brought forth_ and whence is it that the species has not perished? We must suppose either that God_ by a special providence_ with the heat of the sun and the sand (so some think)_ hatches the neglected eggs of the ostrich_ as he feeds the neglected young ones of the raven_ or that_ though the ostrich often leaves her eggs thus_ yet not always. ,20250223
But if they keep their temper_ notwithstanding the spiteful insinuations of those about them_ afterwards it shall be no grief of heart to them_ but shall turn very much to their praise.,20250223
But if_ O man! thy vital streams desert,20250223
But it is hard to find those that really are kind and liberal_ that have done and will do more than either they speak of or care to hear spoken of_ that will be true friends in a strait; such a one as one may trust to is like a black swan.,20250223
But it is piety only that will secure men's true happiness: Those that handle a matter wisely_ if they are proud and lean to their own understanding_ though they may find some good_ yet they will have no great satisfaction in it; but he that trusts in the Lord_ and not in his own wisdom_ happy is he_ and shall speed better at last. Some read the former part of the verse so as to expound it of piety_ which is indeed true wisdom: He that attends to the word (the word of God_ ch. xiii. 13) shall find good in it and good by it. And whoso trusts in the Lord_ in his word which he attends to_ is happy.,20250223
But it is to be found only with some few_ with the ancient_ and those who are blessed with length of days_ who get it by long experience and constant experience; and_ when they have got the wisdom_ they have lost their strength and are unable to execute the results of their wisdom. But now with God there are both wisdom and strength_ wisdom to design the best and strength to accomplish what is designed. He does not get counsel or understanding_ as we do_ by observation_ but he has it essentially and eternally in himself_ v,20250223
But man has no such prospect of a return to life. The vegetable life is a cheap and easy thing: the scent of water will recover it. The animal life_ in some insects and fowls_ is so: the heat of the sun retrieves it. But the rational soul_ when once retired_ is too great_ too noble_ a thing to be recalled by any of the powers of nature; it is out of the reach of sun or rain_ and cannot be restored but by the immediate operations of Omnipotence itself; for (v. 10) man dieth and wasteth_ away_ yea_ man giveth up the ghost_ and where is he? Two words are here used for man:—Geber_ a mighty man_ though mighty_ dies; Adam_ a man of the earth_ because earthy_ gives up the ghost. Note_ Man is a dying creature. He is here described by what occurs_ ,20250223
But many that groan under great oppressions never mind God_ nor take notice of his hand in their troubles; if they did_ they would bear their troubles more patiently and be more benefited by them. Of the many that are afflicted and oppressed_ few get the good they might get by their affliction. It should drive them to God_ but how seldom is this the case! It is lamentable to see so little religion among the poor and miserable part of mankind. Every one complains of his troubles; but none saith_ Where is God my Maker? that is_ none repent of their sins_ none return to him that smites them_ none seek the face and favour of God_ and that comfort in him which would balance their outward afflictions. They are wholly taken up with the wretchedness of their condition_ as if that would excuse them in living without God in the world which should engage them to cleave the more closely to him. Observe_ ,20250223
But most read it otherwise: The preparation of the heart is in man (he may contrive and design this and the other) but the answer of the tongue_ not only the delivering of what he designed to speak_ but the issue and success of what he designed to do_ is of the Lord. That is_ in short,20250223
But no desert can set men out of the reach of God's eye and hand,20250223
But now it is come upon thee_ and thou faintest; it toucheth thee_ and thou art troubled. 6 Is not this thy fear_ thy confidence_ thy hope_ and the uprightness of thy ways?,20250223
But oh that God would speak_ and open his lips against thee,20250223
But put forth thine hand now_ and touch his bone and his flesh_ and he will curse thee to thy face. 6 And the Lord said unto Satan_ Behold_ he is in thine hand; but save his life.,20250223
But that it is not so to God will appear by this_ that the dust of the bodies of the saints_ though scattered_ though mingled with other dust_ will none of it be lost_ for God's eye is upon every grain of it and it shall be forth-coming in the great day.,20250223
But that may as well refer to the proud waves of the sea. We conclude therefore that we are here got back to the patriarchal age_ and_ besides its authority_ we receive this book with veneration for its antiquity.,20250223
But the returning water will restore,20250223
But then it is ill applied to Job; he did not thus perish_ nor was he cut off: a man is never undone till he is in hell. But_ if we understand it of any temporal calamity_ his principle is not true. The righteous perish (Isa. lvii. 1): there is one event both to the righteous and to the wicked (Eccl. ix. both in life and death; the great and certain difference is after death. Even before Job's time (as early as it was) there were instances sufficient to contradict this principle. Did not righteous Abel perish being innocent? and was he not cut off in the beginning of his days? Was not righteous Lot burnt out of house and harbour_ and forced to retire to a melancholy cave? Was not righteous Jacob a Syrian ready to perish? Deut. xxvi,20250223
But there is a filial fear of God_ springing from great and high thoughts of him_ which is the life and soul of all religion. And_ wherever this reigns in the heart_ it will appear by a constant care to depart from evil_ Prov. xvi,20250223
But there is a spirit in man; only he expresses it a little more modestly_ that one man has understanding as well as another_ and no man can pretend to have the monopoly of reason or to engross all the trade of it. Had he meant I have revelation as well as you (as some understand it)_ he must have proved it; but_ if he meant only I have reason as well as you_ they cannot deny it_ for it is every man's honour_ and it is no presumption to claim it_ nor could they gainsay his inference from it (v. 10): Therefore hearken to me. Learn here_ ,20250223
But they did not judge fairly concerning Job: he was really righteous before God_ and not righteous in his own eyes only; so that it was only to save their own credit that they made this the reason of their silence_ as peevish disputants commonly do when they find themselves run a-ground and are not willing to own themselves unable to make their part good.,20250223
But this is not all.,20250223
But those are very proud_ and very ignorant both of God and themselves_ who_ to clear themselves_ will condemn God; and the day is coming when_ if the mistake be not rectified in time by repentance_ the eternal judgment will be both the confutation of the plea and the confusion of the prisoner_ for the heavens shall declare God's righteousness and all the world shall become guilty before him.,20250223
But though they have forgiven him_ though they will make no reprisals_ divine justice will_ and often makes the wicked to avenge the quarrel of the righteous_ and squeezes and crushes one bad man by the hand of another upon him. Thus_ when he is plucked on all sides_ he shall not save of that which he desired (v. not only he shall not save it all_ but he shall save nothing of it. There shall none of his meat (which he coveted so much_ and fed upon with so much pleasure) be left_ v,20250223
But to be forced to restore_ as Judas was_ merely by the horrors of a despairing conscience_ has none of that benefit and comfort attending it_ for he threw down the pieces of silver and went and hanged himself. ,20250223
But to resolve that our hearts shall not reproach us while we still hold fast our integrity is to baffle the designs of the evil spirit (who tempts good Christians to question their adoption_ If thou be the Son of God) and to concur with the operations of the good Spirit_ who witnesses to their adoption.,20250223
But we may suppose in those cases concerning which the law had not made provision the judges afterwards settled the penalties in proportion to the crimes_ according to the equity of the law. Now_ if he that stole an ox out of a man's field must restore five-fold_ it was reasonable that he that stole a man's goods out of his house should restore seven-fold; for there was no law to put him to death_ as with us_ for burglary and robbery on the highway_ and of this worst kind of theft Solomon here speaks; the greatest punishment was that a man might be forced to give all the substance of his house to satisfy the law and his blood was not attainted. But_ ,20250223
But we should keep such a strict and jealous eye as this upon ourselves and our own steps_ both for the discovery of sin past and the prevention of it for the future. It is good for us all to ponder the path of our feet.,20250223
But what reason have men to expect relief_ who are capable of enquiring after God as their Maker and yet cry to him no otherwise than as brutes do?,20250223
But while he prospers he passes for a wise man_ and God lays not folly to him until he saith_ Thou fool_ this night thy soul shall be required of thee_ Luke xii. 20.,20250223
But_ 2. I rather take it as Solomon's advice to keep the mean between that travail which will make a man envied and that slothfulness which will make a man eat his own flesh. Let us by honest industry lay hold on the handful_ that we may not want necessaries_ but not grasp at both the hands full_ which will but create us vexation of spirit. Moderate pains and moderate gains will do best. A man may have but a handful of the world_ and yet may enjoy it and himself with a great deal of quietness_ with content of mind_ peace of conscience_ and the love and good-will of his neighbours_ while many that have both their hands full_ have more than heart could wish_ have a great deal of travail and vexation with it. Those that cannot live on a little_ it is to be feared_ would not live as they should if they had ever so much.,20250223
But_ 2. It is a matter of comfort that God has the devil in a chain_ in a great chain_ Rev. xx. 1. He could not afflict Job without leave from God first asked and obtained_ and then no further than he had leave: __Only upon himself put not forth thy hand; meddle not with his body_ but only with his estate.__ It is a limited power that the devil has; he has no power to debauch men but what they give him themselves_ nor power to afflict men but what is given him from above.,20250223
But_ alas! the sinner's malice is as impotent as it is impudent; what can he do? He strengthens himself (he would be valiant_ so some read it) against the Almighty. He thinks with his exorbitant despotic power to change times and laws (Dan. vii. and_ in spite of Providence_ to carry the day for rapine and wrong_ clear of the check of conscience. Note_ It is the prodigious madness of presumptuous sinners that they enter the lists with Omnipotence. Woe unto him that strives with his Maker. That is generally taken for a further description of the sinner's daring presumption (v. 26): He runs upon him_ upon God himself_ in a direct opposition to him_ to his precepts and providences_ even upon his neck_ as a desperate combatant_ when he finds himself an unequal match for his adversary_ flies in his face_ though_ at the same time_ he falls on his sword's point_ or the sharp spike of his buckler. Sinners_ in general_ run from God; but the presumptuous sinner_ who sins with a high hand_ runs upon him_ fights against him_ and bids defiance to him; and it is easy to foretel what will be the issue. ,20250223
But_ because we may suppose the innocent not to need deliverance (it was guilty Sodom that wanted the benefit of Abraham's intercession)_ I incline to the marginal reading_ The innocent shall deliver the island_ by their advice (Eccl. ix. 14_ 15) and by their prayers and their interest in heaven_ Acts,20250223
But_ if a great and good man was thus reverenced_ how is the great and good God to be feared! 2. The princes and nobles paid great deference to him_ v. 9_,20250223
But_ if men be unjust_ the thing will speak itself_ her own works will praise her in the gates_ openly before all the people. ,20250223
But_ now that he was utterly deprived of all his comforts_ he must be a stock or a stone_ and not have the sense of an ox or a wild ass_ if he did not give some vent to his grief. He was forced to eat unsavoury meats_ and was so poor that he had not a grain of salt wherewith to season them_ nor to give a little taste to the white of an egg_ which was now the choicest dish he had at his table_ v,20250223
But_ on this side hell_ there can be no reason for so vain and ungrateful a wish. It was Job's folly and weakness to curse his day. We must say of it_ This was his infirmity; but good men have sometimes failed in the exercise of those graces which they have been most eminent for_ that we may understand that when they are said to be perfect it is meant that they were upright_ not that they were sinless. Lastly_ Let us observe it_ to the honour of the spiritual life above the natural_ that though many have cursed the day of their first birth_ never any cursed the day of their new-birth_ nor wished they never had had grace_ and the Spirit of grace_ given them. Those are the most excellent gifts_ above life and being itself_ and which will never be a burden.,20250223
But_ one would think_ when all forsook him_ the wife of his bosom should have been tender of him: no_ because he would not curse God and die_ as she persuaded him_ his breath was strange to her too; she did not care for coming near him_ nor took any notice of what he said_ v,20250223
But_ when he so orders it_ the clothes are warm upon us_ which_ in the extremity of cold weather_ would not serve to keep us warm. ,20250223
By an induction of particulars; and here he begins with that which bids fairest of all to be the happiness of a reasonable creature_ and that is knowledge and learning; if this be vanity_ every thing else must needs be so. Now as to this_,20250223
By conniving at men's crimes_ and protecting and countenancing them in oppression and violence_ because of their dignity_ or wealth_ or some personal kindness they have for them. Whatever excuses men may make for it_ certainly it is not good thus to accept the person of the wicked; it is an offence to God_ an affront to justice_ a wrong to mankind_ and a real service done to the kingdom of sin and Satan. The merits of the cause must be regarded_ not the person,20250223
By day_ when they employ themselves abroad: __Thou shalt dig in safety_ thou and thy servants for thee_ and not be again set upon by the plunderers_ who fell upon thy servants at plough___ ch. i. 14_ 15. It is no part of the promised prosperity that he should live in idleness_ but that he should have a calling and follow it_ and_ when he was about the business of it_ should be under the divine protection. Thou shalt dig and be safe_ not rob and be safe_ revel and be safe. The way of duty is the way of safety. ,20250223
By discretion here we must understand religion and grace_ a true taste and relish (so the word signifies) of the honours and pleasures that attend an unspotted virtue; so that a woman without discretion is a woman of a loose and dissolute conversation; and then observe,20250223
By employing ourselves in adoring the depth of those divine counsels of which we cannot find the bottom we shall very much tranquilize our minds under the afflicting hand of God. ,20250223
By giving a cause against justice and equity_ because the person is poor and low in the world_ or not of the same party or persuasion_ or a stranger of another country. This is overthrowing the righteous in judgment_ who ought to be supported_ and whom God will make to stand.,20250223
By her craft and management. She is subtle of heart_ mistress of all the arts of wheedling_ and knowing how by all her caresses to serve her own base purposes,20250223
By her dress. She had the attire of a harlot (v. gaudy and flaunting_ to set her off as a beauty; perhaps she was painted as Jezebel_ and went with her neck and breasts bare_ loose_ and en deshabille. The purity of the heart will show itself in the modesty of the dress_ which becomes women professing godliness,20250223
By her temper and carriage. She is loud and stubborn_ talkative and self-willed_ noisy and troublesome_ wilful and headstrong_ all tongue_ and will have her saying_ right or wrong_ impatient of check and control_ and cannot bear to be counselled_ much less reproved_ by husband or parents_ ministers or friends. She is a daughter of Belial_ that will endure no yoke.,20250223
By his cattle—sheep and camels_ oxen and asses. The numbers of each are here set down_ probably not the exact number_ but thereabout_ a very few under or over. The sheep are put first_ because of most use in the family_ as Solomon observes (Prov. xxvii. 23_ 26_ 27): Lambs for thy clothing_ and milk for the food of thy household. Job_ it is likely_ had silver and gold as well as Abraham (Gen. xiii. 2); but then men valued their own and their neighbours' estates by that which was for service and present use more than by that which was for show and state_ and fit only to be hoarded. As soon as God had made man_ and provided for his maintenance by the herbs and fruits_ he made him rich and great by giving him dominion over the creatures_ Gen. i,20250223
By his own experience; he tried them all_ and found them vanity,20250223
By his servants. He had a very good household or husbandry_ many that were employed for him and maintained by him; and thus he both had honour and did good; yet thus he was involved in a great deal of care and put to a great deal of charge. See the vanity of this world; as goods are increased those must be increased that tend them and occupy them_ and those will be increased that eat them; and what good has the owner thereof save the beholding of them with his eyes? Eccles. v,20250223
By his word. He speaks and it is done_ easily and effectually. The Spirit of God_ in the word_ consumes sinners; with that he slays them_ Hos. vi,20250223
By his wrath. His anger is the ruin of sinners_ who are therefore called vessels of wrath_ and his breath is said to kindle Tophet_ Isa. xxx,20250223
By its arguments it is a light_ which our understandings must subscribe to; it is a lamp to our eyes for discovery_ and so to our feet for direction. The word of God reveals to us truths of eternal certainty_ and is built upon the highest reason. Scripture-light is the sure light. ,20250223
By its authority it is a law_ which our wills must submit to. As never such a light shone out of the schools of the philosophers_ so never such a law issued from the throne of any prince_ so well framed_ and so binding. It is such a law as is a lamp and a light_ for it carries with it the evidence of its own goodness.,20250223
By mighty storms and tempests he shakes the mountains_ which are here called the pillars of heaven (v. and even divides the sea_ and smites through its proud waves_ v,20250223
By night_ when they repose themselves at home: Thou shalt take thy rest (and the sleep of the labouring man is sweet) in safety_ notwithstanding the dangers of the darkness. The pillar of cloud by day shall be a pillar of fire by night: __Thou shalt lie down (v. not forced to wander where there is no place to lay thy head on_ nor forced to watch and sit up in expectation of assaults; but thou shalt go to bed at bedtime_ and not only shall non hurt thee_ but none shall make thee afraid nor so much as give thee an alarm.__ Note_ It is a great mercy to have quiet nights and undisturbed sleeps; those say so that are within the hearing of the noise of war. And the way to be quiet is to seek unto God and keep ourselves in his love. Nothing needs make those afraid who return to God as their rest and take him for their habitation.,20250223
By prayer,20250223
By sickness_ perhaps a few days' sickness_ his flesh_ which was fat_ and fair_ is consumed away_ that it cannot be seen; it is strangely wasted and gone: and his bones_ which were buried in flesh_ now stick out; you may count his ribs_ may tell all his bones. The soul that is well nourished with the bread of life sickness will not make lean_ but it soon makes a change in the body.,20250223
By the breasts of the church's consolations those are nourished who are born from its belly (Isa. xlvi. and by the navel received nourishment in the womb. This comparison we had before_ ch. iv,20250223
By the good government of his tongue. ,20250223
By the law of the wise and righteous_ here_ we may understand either the principles and rules by which they govern themselves or (which comes all to one) the instructions which they give to others_ which ought to be as a law to all about them; and if they be so,20250223
By the ministry. To make the words of the wise more profitable to us_ it is appointed that they should be impressed and fastened by the masters of assemblies. Solemn assemblies for religious worship are an ancient divine institution_ intended for the honour of God and the edification of his church_ and are not only serviceable_ but necessary_ to those ends. There must be masters of these assemblies_ who are Christ's ministers_ and as such are to preside in them_ to be God's mouth to the people and theirs to God. Their business is to fasten the words of the wise_ and drive them as nails to the head_ in order to which the word of God is likewise as a hammer_ Jer. xxiii. 29.,20250223
By the scriptures_ as the standing rule_ the words of the wise_ that is_ of the prophets_ who are called wise men_ Matt. xxiii.,20250223
By these God speaks to the children of men_ and reasons with them. The spirit of a man is the candle of the Lord; and_ wherever men go_ they may hear a voice behind them_ saying_ This is the way; and the voice of conscience is the voice of God_ and not always a still small voice_ but sometimes it cries.,20250223
By this it appears that_ however the scribes and Pharisees had corrupted the law_ not only the commandment of loving our brethren_ but even that of loving our enemies_ was not only a new_ but also an old commandment_ an Old-Testament commandment_ though our Saviour has given it to us with the new enforcement of his own great example in loving us when we were enemies. Observe,20250223
By those that are contrary the one to the other. Some are poor and forced to borrow; others are rich_ have a great deal of the mammon of unrighteousness (deceitful riches they are called)_ and they are creditors_ or usurers_ as it is in the margin. Some are poor_ and honest_ and laborious; others are rich_ slothful_ and deceitful. They meet together in the business of this world_ and have dealings with one another_ and the Lord enlightens both their eyes; he causes his sun to shine upon both and gives them both the comforts of this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace. He enlightens the eyes of the poor by giving them patience_ and of the deceitful by giving them repentance_ as Zaccheus,20250223
By those that we think could best be spared. The poor and the deceitful we are ready to look upon as blemishes of Providence_ but God makes even them to display the beauty of Providence; he has wise ends not only in leaving the poor always with us_ but in permitting the deceived and the deceiver_ for both are his (Job xii. 16) and turn to his praise.,20250223
By visiting the sons and daughters of affliction we may contribute to the improvement_,20250223
By way of admonition: The living will lay it to his heart. Will they? It were well if they would. Those that are spiritually alive will lay it to heart_ and_ as for all the survivors_ one would think they should; it is their own fault if they do not_ for nothing is more easy and natural than by the death of others to be put in mind of our own. Some perhaps will lay that to heart_ and consider their latter end_ who would not lay a good sermon to heart.,20250223
By way of caution to us all to take heed of deceiving ourselves in the great concerns of our souls by resting in that which seems right and is not really so_ and_ for the preventing of a self-delusion_ to be impartial in self-examination and keep up a jealousy over ourselves,20250223
By way of information: That is the end of all men. It is the end of man as to this world_ a final period to his state here; he shall return no more to his house. It is the end of all men; all have sinned and therefore death passes upon all. We must thus be left by our friends_ as the mourners are_ and thus leave_ as the dead do. What is the lot of others will be ours; the cup is going round_ and it will come to our turn to pledge it shortly. ,20250223
By way of motive and inducement thus to labour for wisdom_ and submit to the guidance of it_ consider_ ,20250223
By way of precept and exhortation. David_ in teaching his son_ though he was a child of great capacity and quick apprehension_ yet to show that he was in good earnest_ and to affect his child the more with what he said_ expressed himself with great warmth and importunity_ and inculcated the same thing again and again. So children must be taught. Deut. vi. 7_ Thou shalt whet them diligently upon thy children. David_ though he was a man of public business_ and had tutors for his son_ took all this pains with him himself.,20250223
By way of reproof_ v. 9-11. In these verses,20250223
By way of terror to those whose way is not right_ is not as it should be_ however it may seem to themselves or others; the end of it will certainly be death; to that it has a direct and certain tendency.,20250223
By what rules we may try ourselves whether we have this wisdom or no. This tree will be known by its fruits; if we be truly wise_ it will appear by our care to avoid all evil company and evil practices.,20250223

Call thou_ and I will answer. __Now make thy words good.__,20250223
Can any man_ with all his wisdom_ undertake to number the clouds_ or (as it may be read) to declare and describe the nature of them? Though they are near us_ in our own atmosphere_ yet we know little more of them than of the stars which are at so great a distance. And when the clouds have poured down rain in abundance_ so that the dust grows into solid mire and the clods cleave fast together (v. who can stay the bottles of heaven? Who can stop them_ that it may not always rain? The power and goodness of God are herein to be acknowledged_ that he gives the earth rain enough_ but does not surfeit it_ softens it_ but does not drown it_ makes it fit for the plough_ but not unfit for the seed. As we cannot command a shower of rain_ so we cannot command a fair day_ without God; so necessary_ so constant_ is our dependence upon him.,20250223
Can we put the sea into an egg-shell? We cannot trace the steps he takes in his providence. His way is in the sea. ,20250223
Carefully to keep up good thoughts of God in our minds_ for hard thoughts of him are the inlets of much mischief. ,20250223
Carelessness and want of common prudence_ on the other. He that is a fool in his business_ that either minds it not or goes awkwardly about it_ that has no contrivance and consideration_ no only loses his reputation and interest_ but becomes a servant to the wise in heart. He is impoverished_ and forced to work for his living; while those that manage wisely raise themselves_ and come to have dominion over him_ and others like him. It is rational_ and very fit_ that the fool should be servant to the wise in heart_ and upon that account_ among others_ we are bound to submit our wills to the will of God_ and to be subject to him_ because we are fools and he is infinitely wise.,20250223
Carelessness of her young. It is well that this is peculiar to herself_ for it is a very bad character. Observe_ ,20250223

Cave derives it from Jaab—to love_ or desire_ intimating how welcome his birth was to his parents_ and how much he was the desire of their eyes; and yet there was a time when he cursed the day of his birth. Who can tell what the day may prove which yet begins with a bright morning?,20250223
Certain Punishments of the Wicked; Divine Sovereignty. (b. c. 1520.),20250223

Children are here exhorted to be wise and good,20250223
Children will be a joy to their parents if they be righteous and wise. Righteousness is true wisdom; those who do good so well for themselves. Those are completely such as they should be who are not only wise (that is_ knowing and learned)_ but righteous (that is_ honest and good)_ and not only righteous (that is_ conscientious and well-meaning)_ but wise (that is_ prudent and discreet) in the management of themselves. If such the children be_ especially all the children_ the father and mother will be glad_ and think nothing too much that they have done_ or do_ for them; they will please themselves in them_ and give God thanks for them; particularly she that bore them with pain_ and nursed them with pains_ will rejoice in them_ and reckon herself well requited_ and the sorrow more than forgotten_ because a wise and good man is the product of it_ who is a blessing to the world he was born into.,20250223
Christ and his spouse are here parting for a while; she must stay below in the gardens on earth_ where she has work to do for him; he must remove to the mountains of spices in heaven_ where he has business to attend for her_ as an advocate with the Father. Now observe with what mutual endearments they part.,20250223
Christ and his spouse having sufficiently confirmed their love to each other_ and agreed it to be on both sides strong as death and inviolable_ they are here_ in these verses_ like a loving husband and his wife_ consulting together about their affairs_ and considering what they should do. Yoke-fellows_ having laid their hearts together_ lay their heads together_ to contrive about their relations and about their estates; and_ accordingly_ this happy pair are here advising with one another about a sister_ and a vineyard.,20250223
Christ and sin are rivals for the soul of man_ and here we are told how they both make their court to it_ to have the innermost and uppermost place in it. The design of this representation is to set before us life and death_ good and evil; and there needs no more than a fair stating of the case to determine us which of those to choose_ and surrender our hearts to. They are both brought in making entertainment for the soul_ and inviting it to accept of the entertainment; concerning both we are told what the issue will be; and_ the matter being thus laid before us_ let us consider_ take advice_ and speak our minds. And we are therefore concerned to put a value upon our own souls_ because we see there is such striving for them.,20250223
Christ broke the five loaves and gave to his disciples_ that they might distribute to the multitude. He sits there to receive petitions_ as Ahasuerus admitted Esther's petition at the banquet of wine. He has promised to be present with his people in his ordinances always. Then believers do him all the honour they can_ and study how to express their esteem of him and gratitude to him_ as Mary did when she anointed his head with the ointment of spikenard that was very costly_ one pound of it worth three hundred pence_ and so fragrant that the house was filled with the pleasing odour of it (John xii. which story seems as if it were designed to refer to this passage_ for Christ was then sitting at table. When good Christians_ in any religious duty_ especially in the ordinance of the Lord's supper_ where the King is pleased_ as it were_ to sit with us at his own table_ have their graces exercised_ their hearts broken by repentance_ healed by faith_ and inflamed with holy love and desires toward Christ_ with joyful expectations of the glory to be revealed_ then the spikenard sends forth the smell thereof. Christ is pleased to reckon himself honoured by it_ and to accept of it as an instance of respect to him_ as it was in the wise men of the east_ who paid their homage to the new-born King of the Jews by presenting to him frankincense and myrrh. The graces of God's Spirit in the hearts of believers are exceedingly precious in themselves and pleasing to Christ_ and his presence in ordinances draws them out into act and exercise. If he withdraw_ graces wither and languish_ as plants in the absence of the sun; if he approach_ the face of the soul is renewed_ as of the earth in the spring; and then it is time to bestir ourselves_ that we may not lose the gleam_ not lose the gale; for nothing is done acceptably but what grace does_ Heb. xii. 28.,20250223
Christ called to them_ to warn them of their danger; he stretched out his hand to offer them mercy_ nay_ to help them out of their miserable condition_ stretched out his hand for them to take hold of_ but they refused and no man regarded; some were careless and never heeded it_ nor took notice of what was said to them; others were wilful_ and_ though they could not avoid hearing the will of Christ_ yet they gave him a flat denial_ they refused_,20250223
Christ commends the church's beauty_ ver. 15.,20250223
Christ has made it to appear how much his desire is towards us_ and we are very ungrateful if ours be not towards him. Note_ Communion with Christ is that which all that are sanctified earnestly breathe after; and the clearer discoveries he makes to them of his love the more earnestly do they desire it. Sensual pleasures pall the carnal appetite_ and soon give it surfeit_ but spiritual delights whet the desires_ the language of which is_ Nothing more than God_ but still more and more of him. Christ had said_ I will go up to the palm-tree. Come_ saith she_ Let us go. The promises Christ has made us of communion with him are not to supersede_ but quicken and encourage_ our prayers for that communion,20250223
Christ has told us that none come to him but such as the Father draws_ John vi,20250223
Christ having now returned to his spouse_ and the breach being entirely made up_ and the falling out of these lovers being the renewing of love_ Christ here gives an account both of the distance and of the reconciliation.,20250223
Christ himself is Wisdom_ is Wisdoms_ for in him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge_ and he is the centre of all divine revelation_ not only the essential Wisdom_ but the eternal Word_ by whom God speaks to us and to whom he has committed all judgment; he it is therefore who here both pleads with sinners and passes sentence on them. He calls himself Wisdom_ Luke vii. 35.,20250223
Christ is not now like ointment sealed up_ as it had been long (Ask not after my name_ for it is secret)_ but like ointment poured forth_ which denotes both the freeness and fulness of the communications of his grace by the gospel. ,20250223
Christ is not only beloved by all believing souls_ but is their well-beloved_ their best-beloved_ their only beloved; he has that place in their hearts which no rival can be admitted to_ the innermost and uppermost place. Observe_ ,20250223
Christ is now found of those that sought him_ and very highly applauds the beauty of his spouse_ as one extremely smitten with it (ver. 4-7)_ preferring her before all others (ver. 8_ recommending her to the love and esteem of all her neighbours (ver. and_ lastly_ acknowledging the impressions which her beauty had made upon him and the great delight he took in it_ ver. 11-13.,20250223
Christ is pleased to borrow these expressions of a passionate lover only to express the tenderness of a compassionate Redeemer_ and the delight he takes in his redeemed and in the workings of his own grace in them.,20250223
Christ justly rebukes our delays with his denials_ and suspends the communications of comfort from those that are remiss and drowsy in their duty. (2.),20250223
Christ reproved and counselled them_ not only reproved them for what they did amiss_ but counselled them to do better (those are reproofs of instruction and evidences of love and good-will)_ but they set at nought all his counsel as not worth heeding_ and would none of his reproof_ as if it were below them to be reproved by him and as if they had never done any thing that deserved reproof_ v,20250223
Christ speaks both concerning himself and concerning his church_ ver. 1_ 2.,20250223
Christ the Rose of Sharon.,20250223
Christ will take her with himself from among their dens.,20250223
Christ would not suffer the unclean spirits to say that they knew him to be the Son of God. See Acts xvi. 17_ 18,20250223
Christ's church is his vineyard_ a pleasant and peculiar place_ privileged with many honours; he delights to walk in it_ as a man in his vineyard_ and is pleased with its fruits,20250223
Christ's departures are matter of great grief and lamentation to believers. The royal psalmist never complains of any thing with such sorrowful accents as God's hiding his face from him_ and casting him off_ and forsaking him. The spouse here is ready to tear her hair_ and rend her clothes_ and wring her hands_ crying_ He is gone_ he is gone; and that which cuts her to the heart is that she may thank herself_ she provoked him to withdraw. If Christ departs_ it is because he takes something unkindly.,20250223
Christ's desire was strongly towards his chosen remnant_ when he came from heaven to earth to seek and save them; and when_ in pursuance of his undertaking_ he was even straitened till the baptism of blood he was to pass through for them was accomplished_ Luke xii,20250223
Christ's friends should keep a good correspondence one with another_ and_ as dear companions_ speak often to one another (Mal. iii. 16) and hearken to one another's voice; they should edify_ encourage_ and respect one another. They are companions in the kingdom and patience of Christ_ and therefore_ as fellow-travellers_ should keep up mutual freedom_ and not be shy of_ nor strange to_ one another. The communion of saints is an article of our covenant_ as well as an article of our creed_ to exhort one another daily_ and be glad to be exhorted by another. Hearken to the voice of the church_ as far as it agrees with the voice of Christ; his companions will do so,20250223
Christ's gracious acceptance of the invitation which his church had given him_ and the kind visit which he made to her_ ver. 1.,20250223
Christ's head bespeaks his sovereign dominion over all and his vital influence upon his church and all its members. This is as gold_ gold; the former word in the original signifies shining gold_ the latter strong solid gold; Christ's sovereignty is both beautiful and powerful. Nebuchadnezzar's monarchy is compared to a head of gold (Dan. ii. because it excelled all the other monarchies_ and so does Christ's government. ,20250223
Christ's love is in itself_ and in the account of all the saints_ more valuable and desirable than the best entertainments this world can give. ,20250223
Christ's people are_ and ought to be_ a willing people,20250223
Christ_ as God_ has strength and wisdom; wisdom and might are his; as Redeemer_ he is the wisdom of God and the power of God. To all that are his he is made of God both strength and wisdom; in him they are laid up for us_ that we may both know and do our duty. He is the wonderful counsellor and gives that grace which alone is sound wisdom. He is understanding itself_ and has strength for all those that strengthen themselves in him. True religion gives men the best counsel in all difficult cases_ and helps to make their way plain. Wherever it is_ it is understanding_ it has strength; it will be all that to us that we need_ both for services and sufferings. Where the word of God dwells richly it makes a man perfect and furnishes him thoroughly for every good word and work. Kings_ princes_ and judges_ have of all men most need of wisdom and strength_ of counsel and courage_ for the faithful discharge of the trusts reposed in them_ and that they may be blessings to the people over whom they are set. And therefore Wisdom says_ By me kings reign (v. 15_ that is,20250223

Christ_ under the name of Wisdom_ invites us to accept of his entertainment_ and so to enter into acquaintance and communion with him_ ver. 1-6. And having foretold the different success of his invitation (ver. 7-9) he shows_ in short_ what he requires from us (ver. 10) and what he designs for us (ver. and then leaves it to our choice what we will do_ ver. 12.,20250223

Civil government is a divine institution_ and those that are entrusted with the administration of it have their commission from Christ; it is a branch of his kingly office that by him kings reign; from him to whom all judgment is committed their power is derived. They reign by him_ and therefore ought to reign for him,20250223
Come not night the door of her house. Perhaps he did not know it was the way to an infamous house_ but_ however_ it was a way that he had no business in; and when we have nothing to do the devil will quickly find us something to do.

Coming to comfort him_ they sat down with him upon the ground_ for so he received visits; and they_ not in compliment to him_ but in true compassion_ put themselves into the same humble and uneasy place and posture. They had many a time_ it is likely_ sat with him on his couches and at his table_ in his prosperity_ and were therefore willing to share with him in his grief and poverty because they had shared with him in his joy and plenty. It was not a modish short visit that they made him_ just to look upon him and be gone; but_ as those that could have had no enjoyment of themselves if they had returned to their place while their friend was in so much misery_ they resolved to stay with him till they saw him mend or end_ and therefore took lodgings near him_ though he was not now able to entertain them as he had done_ and they must therefore bear their own charges. Every day_ for seven days together_ at the house in which he admitted company_ they came and sat with him_ as his companions in tribulation_ and exceptions from that rule_ Nullus ad amissas ibit amicus opes—Those who have lost their wealth are not to expect the visits of their friends. They sat with him_ but none spoke a word to him_ only they all attended to the particular narratives he gave of his troubles. They were silent_ as men astonished and amazed. Curæ leves loquuntur_ ingentes stupent—Our lighter griefs have a voice; those which are more oppressive are mute.,20250223
Coming to mourn with him_ they vented their undissembled grief in all the then usual expressions of that passion. They wept aloud; the sight of them (as is usual) revived Job's grief_ and set him a weeping afresh_ which fetched floods of tears from their eyes. They rent their clothes_ and sprinkled dust upon their heads_ as men that would strip themselves_ and abase themselves_ with their friend that was stripped and abased. ,20250223

Compassion is a debt owing to those that are in affliction. The least which those that are at ease can do for those that are pained and in anguish is to pity them_—to manifest the sincerity of a tender concern for them_ and to sympathize with them_—to take cognizance of their case_ enquire into their grievances_ hear their complaints_ and mingle their tears with theirs_—to comfort them_ and to do all they can to help and relieve them: this well becomes the members of the same body_ who should feel for the grievances of their fellow-members_ not knowing how soon the same may be their own,20250223

Concerning Job we are here told_ I. That he was a man; therefore subject to like passions as we are. He was Ish_ a worthy man_ a man of note and eminency_ a magistrate_ a man in authority. The country he lived in was the land of Uz_ in the eastern part of Arabia_ which lay towards Chaldea_ near Euphrates_ probably not far from Ur of the Chaldees_ whence Abraham was called. When God called one good man out of that country_ yet he left not himself without witness_ but raised up another in it to be a preacher of righteousness. God has his remnant in all places_ sealed ones out of every nation_ as well as out of every tribe of Israel_ Rev. vii It was the privilege of the land of Uz to have so good a man as Job in it; now it was Arabia the Happy indeed: and it was the praise of Job that he was eminently good in so bad a place; the worse others were round about him the better he was. His name Job_ or Jjob_ some say_ signifies one hated and counted as an enemy. Others make it to signify one that grieves or groans; thus the sorrow he carried in his name might be a check to his joy in his prosperity. Dr.,20250223

Confidence in an unfaithful man (so we read it)_ in a man whom we thought trusty and therefore depended on_ but who proves otherwise; it proves not only unserviceable_ but painful and vexatious_ like a broken tooth_ or a foot out of joint_ which_ when we put any stress upon it_ not only fails us_ but makes us feel from it_ especially in time of trouble_ when we most expect help from it; it is like a broken reed_ Isa. xxxvi,20250223

Consider how false the charms are.

Proteus-like_ she puts on many shapes_ that she may keep in with those whom she has a design upon. And what does she aim at with all this art and management? Nothing but to keep them from pondering the path of life_ for she knows that_ if they once come to do that_ she shall certainly lose them.

Constantly_ and with an attentive ear. We must hear Wisdom so as to watch daily at her gates_ as beggars to receive an alms_ as clients and patients to receive advice_ and to wait as servants_ with humility_ and patience_ and ready observance_ at the posts of her doors. See here what a good house Wisdom keeps_ for every day is dole-day; what a good school_ for every day is lecture-day. While we have God's works before our eyes_ and his word in our hand_ we may be every day hearing Wisdom_ and learning instruction from her. See here what a dutiful and diligent attendance is required of all Christ's disciples; they must watch at the gates. ,20250223
Contention is as a fire; it heats the spirit_ burns up all that is good_ and puts families and societies into a flame. Now here we are told how that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning_ that we may avoid the occasions of strife and so prevent the mischievous consequences of it. If then we would keep the peace,20250223
Contentions commonly happen among the mighty_ that are jealous for their honour and right and stand upon the punctilios of both_ that are confident of their being able to make their part good and therefore will hardly condescend to the necessary terms of an accommodation; whereas those that are poor are forced to be peaceable_ and sit down losers,20250223
Continuing and constant (v. 13): They spend their days_ all their days_ in wealth_ and never know what it is to want—in mirth_ and never know what sadness means; and at last_ without any previous alarms to frighten them_ without any anguish or agony_ in a moment they go down to the grave_ and there are no bands in their death. If there were not another life after this_ it were most desirable to die by the quickest shortest strokes of death. Since we must go down to the grave_ if that were the furthest of our journey_ we should wish to go down in a moment_ to swallow the bitter pill_ and not chew it.,20250223

Corruption appearing in the actings of it: I sleep. The wise virgins slumbered. She was on her bed (ch. iii. 1)_ but now she sleeps. Spiritual distempers_ if not striven against at first_ are apt to grow upon us and to get ground. She slept_ that is_ pious affections cooled_ she neglected her duty and grew remiss in it_ she indulged herself in her ease_ was secure and off her watch. This is sometimes the bad effect of more than ordinary enlargements—a good cause. St. Paul himself was in danger of being puffed up with abundant revelations_ and of saying_ Soul_ take thy ease_ which made a thorn in the flesh necessary for him_ to keep him from sleeping. Christ's disciples_ when he had come into his garden_ the garden of his agony_ were heavy with sleep_ and could not watch with him. True Christians are not always alike lively and vigorous in religion,20250223
Counsel to Magistrates.,20250223
Covenant-breaking. It is a snare to a man_ after he has made vows to God_ to enquire how he may evade them or get dispensed with_ and to contrive excuses for the violating of them. If the matter of them was doubtful_ and the expressions were ambiguous_ that was his fault; he should have made them with more caution and consideration_ for it will involve his conscience (if it be tender) in great perplexities_ if he be to enquire concerning them afterwards (Eccl. v. 6); for_ when we have opened our mouth to the Lord_ it is too late to think of going back_ Acts v. 4.,20250223
Covetous men think it is their wisdom_ imagining that if they be rich to such a degree they shall be completely happy. Cease from that wisdom_ for it is a mistake; a man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses_ Luke xii,20250223
Cruelty and blood-thirstiness. The devil was_ from the beginning_ a liar and a murderer (John viii. and therefore_ as a lying tongue_ so hands that shed innocent blood are hateful to God_ because they have in them the devil's image and do him service,20250223
Cruelty to the poor is great wickedness and cries aloud for vengeance. Those who show no mercy to such as lie at their mercy shall themselves have judgment without mercy. Another instance of their barbarous treatment of those they have advantage against is that they take from them even their necessary food and raiment; they squeeze them so with their extortion that they cause them to go naked without clothing (v. 10) and so catch their death. And if a poor hungry family has gleaned a sheaf of corn_ to make a little cake of_ that they may eat it and die_ even that they take away from them_ being well pleased to see them perish for want_ while they themselves are fed to the full,20250223

Death Anticipated. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Death is a grand secret. 1. We know not beforehand when_ and how_ and by what means_ we or others shall be brought to death_ by what road we must go the way whence we shall not return_ what disease or what disaster will be the door to let us into the house appointed for all living. Man knows not his time,20250223
Death is an enemy that we must all enter the lists with_ sooner or later: There is no discharge in that war_ no dismission from it_ either of the men of business or of the faint-hearted_ as there was among the Jews_ Deut. xx. 5_ 8. While we live we are struggling with death_ and we shall never put off the harness till we put off the body_ never obtain a discharge till death has obtained the mastery; the youngest is not released as a fresh-water soldier_ nor the oldest as miles emeritus—a soldier whose merits have entitled him to a discharge. Death is a battle that must be fought_ There is no sending to that war (so some read it)_ no substituting another to muster for us_ no champion admitted to fight for us; we must ourselves engage_ and are concerned to provide accordingly_ as for a battle. ,20250223
Death itself shall dwell in his tabernacle_ and_ having expelled him_ shall take possession of his house_ to the terror and destruction of all that he leaves behind. Even the dwelling shall be ruined for the sake of its owner: Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation_ rained upon it as upon Sodom_ to the destruction of which this seems to have reference. Some think he here upbraids Job with the burning of his sheep and servants with fire from heaven. The reason is here given why his tabernacle is thus marked for ruin: Because it is none of his; that is_ it was unjustly got_ and kept_ from the rightful owner_ and therefore let him not expect either the comfort or the continuance of it. His children shall perish_ either with him or after him_ v,20250223
Death strips us of all our enjoyments; clothing can neither warm nor adorn a dead body. This consideration silenced Job under all his losses. ,20250223
Death will be an occasion of sorrow to our friends that love us. When man goes to his long home the mourners go about the streets—the real mourners_ and those_ as now with us_ distinguished by their habits as they go along the streets_—the mourners for ceremony_ that were hired to weep for the dead_ both to express and to excite the real mourning. When we die we not only remove to a melancholy house before us_ but we leave a melancholy house behind us. Tears are a tribute due to the dead_ and this_ among other circumstances_ makes it a serious thing to die. But in vain do we go to the house of mourning_ and see the mourners go about the streets_ if it do not help to make us serious and pious mourners in the closet. ,20250223
Death will dissolve the frame of nature and take down the earthly house of this tabernacle_ which is elegantly described_,20250223
Death will fix us in an unchangeable state: Man shall then go to his long home_ and all these infirmities and decays of age are harbingers of and advances towards that awful remove. At death man goes from this world and all the employments and enjoyments of it. He has gone for good and all_ as to his present state. He has gone home_ for here he was a stranger and pilgrim; both soul and body go to the place whence they came_ v,20250223
Death will resolve us into our first principles_ v,20250223
Death_ and all its terrors_ will not frighten a believer from loving Christ: Many waters_ though they will quench fire_ cannot quench this love_ no_ nor the floods drown it_ v.,20250223
Defer not to pay it. If it be in the power of thy hands to pay it to-day_ leave it not till to-morrow; do not beg a day_ nor put it off to a more convenient season. By delay the sense of the obligation slackens and cools_ and is in danger of wearing off; we thereby discover a loathness and backwardness to perform our vow; and qui non est hodie cras minus aptus erit—he who is not inclined to-day will be averse to-morrow. The longer it is put off the more difficult it will be to bring ourselves to it; death may not only prevent the payment_ but fetch thee to judgment_ under the guilt of a broken vow_ Ps. lxxvi. 11.,20250223

Did I say_ Bring unto me or give me a reward of your substance? Yet what they brought he thankfully accepted_ and did not upbraid them with their former unkindnesses_ nor ask them why they did not do this sooner. He was neither so covetous and griping as to ask their charity_ nor so proud and ill-natured as to refuse it when they offered it; and_ being in so good a temper_ God gave him that which was far better than their money and ear-rings_ and that was his blessing_ v,20250223
Did he look down upon his present troubles? He saw God giving them their commission_ and their orders to attack him. They are his troops_ that act by his direction_ which encamp against me_ v,20250223
Did he look forward for deliverance? He saw the hand of God cutting off all hopes of that (v. 8): __He hath fenced up my way_ that I cannot pass. I have now no way left to help myself_ either to extricate myself out of my troubles or to ease myself under them. Would I make any motion_ take any steps towards deliverance? I find my way hedged up; I cannot do what I would; nay_ if I would please myself with the prospect of a deliverance hereafter_ I cannot do it; it is not only out of my reach_ but out of my sight: God hath set darkness in my paths_ and there is none to tell me how long___ Ps.,20250223
Did victory and success attend the strong? No; there was found in this little city_ among the few men that were in it_ one poor wise man—a wise man_ and yet poor_ and not preferred to any place of profit or power in the city; places of trust were not given to men according to their merit_ and meetness for them_ else such a wise man as this would not have been a poor man. Now,20250223
Direction is given to use them accordingly. Princes_ instead of giving honour to a fool (v. 1)_ must put disgrace upon him—instead of putting power into his hand_ must exercise power over him. A horse unbroken needs a whip for correction_ and an ass a bridle for direction and to check him when he would turn out of the way; so a vicious man_ who will not be under the guidance and restraint of religion and reason_ ought to be whipped and bridled_ to be rebuked severely_ and made to smart for what he has done amiss_ and to be restrained from offending any more.,20250223

Divine Justice and Power; God's Dominion over the Proud. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Divine revelation is the word and wisdom of God_ and that pure religion and undefiled which is built upon it; and of that Solomon here speaks_ recommending it to us as faithful_ and well worthy of all acceptation_ ver. 1-21. God_ by it_ instructs_ and governs_ and blesses_ the children of men.,20250223
Divine revelation is wisdom; all its dictates_ all its laws_ are wise as wisdom itself. God does_ by the written word_ by the law of Moses_ which sets before us the blessing and the curse_ by the priests' lips which keep knowledge_ by his servants the prophets_ and all the ministers of this word_ declare his mind to sinners_ and give them warning as plainly as that which is proclaimed in the streets or courts of judicature by the criers. God_ in his word_ not only opens the case_ but argues it with the children of men. Come_ now_ and let us reason together_ Isa. i. 18,20250223
Do not say that it is a pity to correct them_ and that_ because they cry and beg to be forgiven_ you cannot find in your heart to do it. If the point can be gained without correction_ well and good; but if you find_ as it often proves_ that your forgiving them once_ upon a dissembled repentance and promise of amendment_ does but embolden them to offend again_ especially if it be a thing that is in itself sinful (as lying_ swearing_ ribaldry_ stealing_ or the like)_ in such a case put on resolution_ and let not thy soul spare for his crying. It is better that he should cry under thy rod than under the sword of the magistrate_ or_ which is more fearful_ that of divine vengeance.,20250223
Do not think with them_ for their heart studies destruction to others_ but it will prove destruction to themselves. Do not speak like them_ for their lips talk of their mischief. All they say has an ill tendency_ to dishonour God_ reproach religion_ or wrong their neighbour; but it will be mischief to themselves at last. It is therefore thy wisdom to have nothing to do with them. Nor hast thou any reason to look upon them with envy_ but with pity rather_ or a just indignation at their wicked practices.__,20250223
Does God thunder thus marvellously with his voice? We must then conclude that his other works are great_ and such as we cannot comprehend. From this one instance we may argue to all_ that_ in the dispensations of his providence_ there is that which is too great_ too strong_ for us to oppose or strive against_ and too high_ too deep_ for us to arraign or quarrel with.,20250223

Doth not the ear try words_ as the mouth tastes meat? may be taken either as the conclusion to the foregoing discourse or the preface to what follows. The mind of man has as good a faculty of discerning between truth and error_ when duly stated_ as the palate has of discerning between what is sweet and what is bitter. Job therefore demands from his friends a liberty to judge for himself of what they had said_ and desires them to use the same liberty in judging of what he had said; nay_ he seems to appeal to any man's impartial judgment in this controversy; let the ear try the words on both sides_ and it would be found that he was in the right. Note_ The ear must try words before it receives them so as to subscribe to them. As by the taste we judge what food is wholesome to the body and what not_ so by the spirit of discerning we must judge what doctrine is sound_ and savoury_ and wholesome_ and what not_ 1 Cor. x. 15; xi. 13.,20250223

E C C L E S I A S T E S,20250223
Eat_ O friends! Those only that are Christ's friends are welcome to his table; his enemies_ that will not have him to reign over them_ have no part nor lot in the matter. Drink_ yea_ drink abundantly. Christ_ in his gospel_ has made plentiful provision for poor souls. He fills the hungry with good things; there is enough for all_ there is enough for each; we are not straitened in him or in his grace_ let us not therefore be straitened in our own bosoms. Open the mouth widely_ and Christ will fill it. Be not drunk with wine_ but be filled with the Spirit_ Eph. v,20250223
Elihu differed in opinion from them_ and yet he calls them wise and knowing men. Peevish disputants think all fools that are not of their mind; but it is a piece of justice which we owe to those who are wise to acknowledge it_ though our sentiments do not agree with theirs,20250223
Elihu here addresses himself closely to Job_ desiring him to apply what he had hitherto said to himself. He begs that he would hearken to this discourse (v. that he would pause awhile: Stand still_ and consider the wondrous works of God. What we hear is not likely to profit us unless we consider it_ and we are not likely to consider things fully unless we stand still and compose ourselves to the consideration of them. The works of God_ being wondrous_ both deserve and need our consideration_ and the due consideration of them will help to reconcile us to all his providences. Elihu_ for the humbling of Job_ shows him_,20250223
Elihu here addresses himself more directly to Job. He had spoken to the rest (v. 10) as men of understanding; now_ speaking to Job; he puts an if upon his understanding: If thou hast understanding_ hear this and observe it_ v. 16.,20250223

Elihu here goes on to extol the wonderful power of God in the meteors and all the changes of the weather: if_ in those changes_ we submit to the will of God_ take the weather as it is and make the best of it_ why should we not do so in other changes of our condition? Here he observes the hand of God_,20250223
Elihu here returns an answer to another word that Job had said_ which_ he thought_ reflected much upon the justice and goodness of God_ and therefore ought not to pass without a remark. Observe_,20250223
Elihu humbly addresses himself to the auditors_ and endeavours_ like an orator_ to gain their good-will and their favourable attention. 1. He calls them wise men_ and men that had knowledge_ v,20250223
Elihu is here endeavouring to possess Job with great and high thoughts of God_ and so to persuade him into a cheerful submission to his providence.,20250223
Elihu's modesty appeared in the patient attention he gave to what his seniors said_ v. 11_ 12. He waited for their words as one that expected much from them_ agreeably to the opinion he had of these grave men. He gave ear to their reasons_ that he might take their meaning_ and fully understand what was the drift of their discourse and what the force of their arguments. He attended to them with diligence and care_ and this_ ,20250223
Elihu_ being to speak on God's behalf_ and particularly to ascribe righteousness to his Maker_ here shows that the disposals of divine Providence are all_ not only according to the eternal counsels of his will_ but according to the eternal rules of equity. God acts as a righteous governor_ for_,20250223
Elihu_ having largely reproved Job for some of his unadvised speeches_ which Job had nothing to say in the vindication of_ here comes more generally to set him to rights in his notions of God's dealings with him. His other friends had stood to it that_ because he was a wicked man_ therefore his afflictions were so great and so long. But Elihu only maintained that the affliction was sent for his trial_ and that therefore it was lengthened out because Job was not_ as yet_ thoroughly humbled under it_ nor had duly accommodated himself to it. He urges many reasons_ taken from the wisdom and righteousness of God_ his care of his people_ and especially his greatness and almighty power_ with which_ in this and the following chapter_ he persuades him to submit to the hand of God. Here we have_,20250223
Elihu_ it is likely_ paused awhile_ to see if Job had any thing to say against his discourse in the foregoing chapter; but he sitting silent_ and it is likely intimating his desire that he would go on_ he here proceeds. And_,20250223
Eliphaz and his companions had condemned Job_ in general_ as a wicked man and a hypocrite; but none of them had descended to particulars_ nor drawn up any articles of impeachment against him_ until Eliphaz did so here_ where he positively and expressly charges him with many high crimes and misdemeanours_ which_ if he had really been guilty of them_ might well have justified them in their harsh censures of him. __Come___ says Eliphaz_ __we have been too long beating about the bush_ too tender of Job and afraid of grieving him_ which has but confirmed him in his self-justification. It is high time to deal plainly with him. We have condemned him by parables_ but that does not answer the end; he is not prevailed with to condemn himself. We must therefore plainly tell him_ Thou art the man_ the tyrant_ the oppressor_ the atheist_ we have been speaking of all this while. Is not thy wickedness great? Certainly it is_ or else thy troubles would not be so great. I appeal to thyself_ and thy own conscience; are not thy iniquities infinite_ both in number and heinousness?__ Strictly taken_ nothing is infinite but God; but he means this_ that his sins were more than could be counted and more heinous than could be conceived. Sin_ being committed against Infinite Majesty_ has in it a kind of infinite malignity. But when Eliphaz charges Job thus highly_ and ventures to descend to particulars too_ laying to his charge that which he knew not_ we may take occasion hence,20250223
Eliphaz checks him for his complaints of God_ and of his dealings with him_ as if he thought God had done him wrong_ ver. 2-4.,20250223
Eliphaz concluded his discourse with an air of assurance; very confident he was that what he had said was so plain and so pertinent that nothing could be objected in answer to it. But_ though he that is first in his own cause seems just_ yet his neighbour comes and searches him. Job is not convinced by all he had said_ but still justifies himself in his complaints and condemns him for the weakness of his arguing.,20250223
Eliphaz foresaw their ruin with an eye of faith. Those who looked only at present things blessed their habitation_ and thought them happy_ blessed it long_ and wished themselves in their condition. But Eliphaz cursed it_ suddenly cursed it_ as soon as he saw them begin to take root_ that is_ he plainly foresaw and foretold their ruin; not that he prayed for it (I have not desired the woeful day)_ but he prognosticated it. He went into the sanctuary_ and there understood their end and heard their doom read (Ps. lxxiii. 17_ that the prosperity of fools will destroy them_ Prov.,20250223
Eliphaz had been very severe in his censures of Job; and his companions_ though as yet they had said little_ yet had intimated their concurrence with him. Their unkindness therein poor Job here complains of_ as an aggravation of his calamity and a further excuse of his desire to die; for what satisfaction could he ever expect in this world when those that should have been his comforters thus proved his tormentors?,20250223
Eliphaz had charged him with hypocrisy in religion_ but he specifies prayer_ the great act of religion_ and professes that in that he was pure_ though not from all infirmity_ yet from reigning and allowed guile: it was not like the prayers of the Pharisees_ who looked no further than to be seen of men_ and to serve a turn.,20250223
Eliphaz had particularly charged Job with unmercifulness to the poor (ch. xxii. 6_ &c.): Thou hast withholden bread from the hungry_ stripped the naked of their clothing_ and sent widows away empty. One would think he could not have been so very positive and express in his charge unless there had been some truth in it_ some ground_ for it; and yet it appears_ by Job's protestation_ that it was utterly false and groundless; he was never guilty of any such thing. See here_,20250223
Eliphaz here advances another argument to prove Job a hypocrite_ and will have not only his impatience under his afflictions to be evidence against him but even his afflictions themselves_ being so very great and extraordinary_ and there being no prospect at all of his deliverance out of them. To strengthen his argument he here lays down these two principles_ which seem plausible enough:—,20250223
Eliphaz here falls very foul upon Job_ because he contradicted what he and his colleagues had said_ and did not acquiesce in it and applaud it_ as they expected. Proud people are apt thus to take it very much amiss if they may not have leave to dictate and give law to all about them_ and to censure those as ignorant and obstinate_ and all that is naught_ who cannot in every thing say as they say. Several great crimes Eliphaz here charges Job with_ only because he would not own himself a hypocrite.,20250223
Eliphaz here insinuates that_ because Job complained so much of his afflictions_ he thought God was unjust in afflicting him; but it was a strained innuendo. Job was far from thinking so. What Eliphaz says here is therefore unjustly applied to Job_ but in itself it is very true and good_,20250223
Eliphaz here leads on a third attack upon poor Job_ in which Bildad followed him_ but Zophar drew back_ and quitted the field. It was one of the unhappinesses of Job_ as it is of many an honest man_ to be misunderstood by his friends. He had spoken of the prosperity of wicked men in this world as a mystery of Providence_ but they took it for a reflection upon Providence_ as countenancing their wickedness; and they reproached him accordingly. In this chapter_,20250223
Eliphaz_ having endeavoured to convict Job_ by setting his sins (as he thought) in order before him_ here endeavours to awaken him to a sight and sense of his misery and danger by reason of sin; and this he does by comparing his case with that of the sinners of the old world; as if he had said_ __Thy condition is bad now_ but_ unless thou repent_ it will be worse_ as theirs was—theirs who were overflown with a flood_ as the old world (v. and theirs the remnant of whom the fire consumed__ (v. namely_ the Sodomites_ who_ in comparison of the old world_ were but a remnant. And these two instances of the wrath of God against sin and sinners are more than once put together_ for warning to a careless world_ as by our Saviour (Luke xvii. 26_ &c.) and the apostle_ 2 Pet. ii. 5_,20250223
Eliphaz_ having reproved Job for his answers_ here comes to maintain his own thesis_ upon which he built his censure of Job. His opinion is that those who are wicked are certainly miserable_ whence he would infer that those who are miserable are certainly wicked_ and that therefore Job was so. Observe_,20250223
Eliphaz_ having touched Job in a very tender part_ in mentioning both the loss of his estate and the death of his children as the just punishment of his sin_ that he might not drive him to despair_ here begins to encourage him_ and puts him in a way to make himself easy. Now he very much changes his voice (Gal. iv. and speaks in the accents of kindness_ as if he would atone for the hard words he had given him.,20250223
Eliphaz_ having undertaken to convince Job of the sin and folly of his discontent and impatience_ here vouches a vision he had been favoured with_ which he relates to Job for his conviction. What comes immediately from God all men will pay a particular deference to_ and Job_ no doubt_ as much as any. Some think Eliphaz had this vision now lately_ since he came to Job_ putting words into his mouth wherewith to reason with him; and it would have been well if he had kept to the purport of this vision_ which would serve for a ground on which to reprove Job for his murmuring_ but not to condemn him as a hypocrite. Others think he had it formerly; for God did_ in this way_ often communicate his mind to the children of men in those first ages of the world_ ch. xxxiii,20250223
Eliphaz_ in the beginning of his discourse_ had been very sharp upon Job_ and yet it does not appear that Job gave him any interruption_ but heard him patiently till he had said all he had to say. Those that would make an impartial judgment of a discourse must hear it out_ and take it entire. But_ when he had concluded_ he makes his reply_ in which he speaks very feelingly.,20250223
Eliphaz_ in the foregoing chapter_ for the making good of his charge against Job_ had vouched a word from heaven_ sent him in a vision. In this chapter he appeals to those that bear record on earth_ to the saints_ the faithful witnesses of God's truth in all ages_ ver. 1. They will testify_,20250223
Eliphaz_ in this concluding paragraph of his discourse_ gives Job (what he himself knew not how to take) a comfortable prospect of the issue of his afflictions_ if he did but recover his temper and accommodate himself to them. Observe_,20250223
Eliphaz_ to convince Job of his inability to judge of the divine counsels_ asks him (Job xv.,20250223
Enquiring after Christ.,20250223
Enquiring after the Excellencies of Christ; The Church's Confidence in Christ.,20250223

Envy_ and malice_ and greediness of the world_ are the rottenness of the bones and the consumption of the flesh.,20250223
Especially to give a reproof with discretion_ and so as to make it acceptable. If it be well given_ by a wise reprover_ and well taken_ by an obedient ear_ it is an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold_ very graceful and well becoming both the reprover and the reproved; both will have their praise_ the reprover for giving it so prudently and the reproved for taking it so patiently and making a good use of it. Others will commend them both_ and they will have satisfaction in each other; he who gave the reproof is pleased that it had the desired effect_ and he to whom it was given has reason to be thankful for it as a kindness. That is well given_ we say_ that is well taken; yet it does not always prove that that is well taken which is well given. It were to be wished that a wise reprover should always meet with an obedient ear_ but often it is not so.,20250223
Especially to see them live in love_ and unity_ and mutual good affection_ no jars or quarrels among them_ no strangeness_ no shyness one of another_ no strait-handedness_ but_ though every one knew his own_ they lived with as much freedom as if they had had all in common. It is comfortable to the hearts of parents_ and comely in the eyes of all_ to see brethren thus knit together. Behold_ how good and how pleasant it is! Ps. cxxxiii. 1.,20250223
Even among the brute creatures the greater devour the less and the stronger prey upon the weaker_ and men are as the fishes of the sea_ Hab. i,20250223
Even great sinners may enjoy great prosperity. Observe,20250223
Even in death_ when riches fail men_ the bones of the righteous shall flourish as a herb_ Isa. lxvi,20250223
Even kings must be catechised; the greatest of men is less than the least of the ordinances of God,20250223
Even kings' hearts are so_ notwithstanding their powers and prerogatives_ as much as the hearts of common persons. The hearts of kings are unsearchable to us_ much more unmanageable by us; as they have their arcana imperii—state secrets_ so that they have great prerogatives of their crown; but the great God has them not only under his eye_ but in his hand. Kings are what he makes them. Those that are most absolute are under God's government; he puts things into their hearts_ Rev. xvii. 17; Ezra vii. 27.,20250223
Even secret things_ both good and evil_ will be brought to light_ and brought to account_ in the judgment of the great day (Rom. ii. 16); there is no good work_ no bad work_ hid_ but shall then be made manifest,20250223
Even that food which once he would have scorned to touch he was now glad of_ and it was his sorrowful meat_ v,20250223
Even the contentions of the mighty may be ended by lot if they cannot otherwise be compromised_ and sometimes better so than by arguments which are endless_ or concessions which they are loth to stoop to_ whereas it is no disparagement to a man to acquiesce in the determination of the lot when once it is referred to that. To prevent quarrels Canaan was divided by lot; and_ if lusory lots had not profaned this way of appeal to Providence_ perhaps it might be very well used now for the deciding of many controversies_ both to the honour of God and the satisfaction of the parties_ provided it were done with prayer and due solemnity_ this and some other scriptures seeming to direct to it_ especially Acts i,20250223
Even the hearts of men are in God's hand_ and not only their goings_ as he had said_ ch. xx,20250223
Even the just upright man_ that is in his generation as a burning and shining light_ if he enter into temptation (Ps. lxxiii. 2) or come under a cloud_ is looked upon with contempt. See here_ ,20250223
Even the little children who were born in his house_ the children of his own servants_ who were his servants by birth_ despised him_ and spoke against him (v. 18); though he arose in civility to speak friendly to them_ or with authority to check them_ they let him know that they neither feared him nor loved him.,20250223
Even the strength of an elephant_ as of a horse and an ox_ may be supported without flesh; and why not that of a man? Though therefore we use the liberty God has allowed us_ yet be not among riotous eaters of flesh_ Prov. xxiii,20250223
Even their tabernacles prosper_ those that live with them and those that come after them and descend from them. It seems as if a blessing were entailed upon their families; and that is sometimes preserved to succeeding generations which was got by fraud.,20250223
Even then he saw himself exposed_ and did not make his wealth his strong city nor trust in the abundance of his riches_ but the name of the Lord was his strong tower; in that only he thought himself safe_ and to that he ascribed it that he was then safe and that his comforts were preserved to him. The devil saw a hedge about him of God's making (ch. i. and Job saw it himself_ and owned it was God's visitation that preserved his spirit_ ch. x,20250223
Even these riches will go to decay if they be not well looked after. If a man had an abbey (as we say)_ and were slothful and wasteful_ he might make an end of it. Even the crown and the revenues of it_ if care be not taken_ will suffer damage_ nor will it continue to every generation without very good management. Though David had the crown entailed on his family_ yet he looked well to his flocks_ 1 Chron. xxvii. 29_ 31.,20250223
Even while it is in its greenness it is dried away and gone in a little time. Note_ The best state of hypocrites and evil-doers borders upon withering; even when it is green it is going. The grass is cut down and withers (Ps. xc. 6); but the rush is not cut down and yet withers_ withers before it grows up (Ps. cxxix. 6): as it has no use_ so it has no continuance. So are the paths of all that forget God (v. 13); they take the same way that the rush does_ for the hypocrite's hope shall perish. Note_ ,20250223
Even while they prosper thus they are as stubble and chaff before the stormy wind_ v,20250223
Even while we have our residence on these mountains_ yet we must look for them_ look above them. Shall we lift up our eyes to the hills? No; our help comes from the Lord_ Ps. cxxi. 1_ 2. We must look beyond them_ to the things that are not seen (as these high hills are)_ that are eternal. From the tops of Shenir and Hermon_ which were on the other side Jordan_ as from Pisgah_ they could see the land of Canaan; from this world we must look forward to the better country. ,20250223
Even wicked men_ while they live_ may keep up a confident expectation of a happiness when they die_ or at least a happiness in this world. The hypocrite has his hope_ in which he wraps himself as the spider in her web. The worldling expects great matters from his wealth; he calls it goods laid up for many years_ and hopes to take his ease in it and to be merry; but in death their expectation will be frustrated: the worldling must leave this world which he expected to continue in and the hypocrite will come short of that world which he expected to remove to_ Job xxvii. 8,20250223
Every man must be just to his family_ else he is not true to his stewardship.,20250223
Every man shall drink as he brews_ eat as he speaks; for by our words we must be justified or condemned_ Matt. xii,20250223
Every man that passes by on the road_ of what rank or condition soever_ may know what is good_ and what the Lord requires of him_ if it be not his own fault. There is no speech nor language where Wisdom's voice is not heard; her discoveries and directions are given to all promiscuously. He that has ears to hear_ let him hear,20250223
Every man therefore must be careful not to injure them in any thing_ or to invade their rights_ either by a clandestine removal of the old land-marks or by a forcible entry into their fields. Being fatherless_ they have none to redress their wrongs_ and_ being in their childhood_ they do not so much as apprehend the wrong that is done them. Sense of honour_ and much more the fear of God_ would restrain men from offering injury to children_ especially fatherless children.,20250223
Every man_ even those that have not the benefit of divine revelation_ may see this; for there is no speech or language where the voice of these natural constant preachers is not heard_ Ps. xix. 3,20250223
Every one gave him a piece of money (some more_ it is likely_ and some less_ according to their ability) and every one an ear-ring of gold (an ornament much used by the children of the east)_ which would be as good as money to him: this was a superfluity which they could well spare_ and the rule is_ That our abundance must be a supply to our brethren's necessity. But why did Job's relations now_ at length_ show this kindness to him? ,20250223
Every one turneth to his course_ as the horse rusheth into the battle. When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil_ and he is carried on in a wicked way by the violence of inordinate appetites and passions_ there is no making him afraid of the wrath of God and the fatal consequences of sin. Let his own conscience set before him the curse of the law_ the death that is the wages of sin_ and all the terrors of the Almighty in battle-array; he mocks at this fear_ and is not affrighted_ neither turns he back from the flaming sword of the cherubim. Let ministers lift up their voice like a trumpet_ to proclaim the wrath of God against him_ he believes not that it is the sound of the trumpet_ nor that God and his heralds are in earnest with him; but what will be in the end hereof it is easy to foresee.,20250223
Every one will make court to those whom the world smiles upon_ though otherwise unworthy: The rich have many friends_ friends to their riches_ in hope to get something out of them. There is little friendship in the world but what is governed by self-interest_ which is no true friendship at all_ nor what a wise man will either value himself on or put any confidence in. Those that make the world their God idolize those that have most of its good things_ and seek their favour as if indeed they were Heaven's favourites.,20250223
Every thing is as God has made it; it is really as he appointed it to be_ not as it appears to us,20250223
Every thing is open before him (v. 21): His eyes are upon the ways of man; not only they are within reach of his eye_ so that he can see them_ but his eye is upon them_ so that he actually observes and inspects them. He sees us all_ and sees all our goings; go where we will_ we are under his eye; all our actions_ good and evil_ are regarded and recorded and reserved to be brought into judgment when the books shall be opened. ,20250223
Every work will then be brought into judgment_ will be enquired into and called over again. It will be a day to bring to remembrance every thing done in the body,20250223
Evil may be foreseen. Where there is temptation_ it is easy to foresee that if we thrust ourselves into it there will be sin_ and as easy to foresee that if we venture upon the evil of sin there will follow the evil of punishment; and_ commonly_ God warns before he wounds_ having set watchmen over us_ Jer. vi. 17,20250223
Extent of Human Discoveries. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Fair reasoning has a commanding power_ and it is a wonder if men are not conquered by it; but railing and foul language are impotent and foolish_ and it is no wonder if men are exasperated and hardened by them,20250223
False in itself_ and then they prove me a liar; or_ 2. Foreign_ and nothing to the purpose_ and then they prove my speech frivolous and nothing worth.__ That indeed which is false is nothing worth; where there is not truth_ how can there be goodness? But those that speak the words of truth and soberness need not fear having what they say brought to the test_ but can cheerfully submit it to a fair examination_ as Job does here.,20250223
False-witness bearing_ which is one of the greatest mischiefs that the wicked imagination can devise_ and against which there is least fence. There cannot be a greater affront to God (to whom in an oath appeal is made) nor a greater injury to our neighbour (all whose interests in this world_ even the dearest_ lie open to an attack of this kind) than knowingly to give in a false testimony. There are seven things which God hates_ and lying involves two of them; he hates it_ and doubly hates it,20250223
Falsehood and Oppression Reproved.,20250223
Falsehood_ and fraud_ and dissimulation. Next to a proud look nothing is more an abomination to God than a lying tongue; nothing more sacred than truth_ nor more necessary to conversation than speaking truth. God and all good men hate and abhor lying,20250223
Far be it from him that he should and from us that we should suspect him. He never oppresses the innocent_ nor lays a greater load on the guilty than they deserve. He is God_ the Judge; and shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? Gen. xviii.,20250223
Fear argues a degenerate soul.,20250223
Few put a due value upon it. Men know not the worth of it_ its innate excellency_ their need of it_ and of what unspeakable advantage it will be to them; and therefore_ though they have many a price in their hand to get this wisdom_ yet they have no heart to it_ Prov. xvii,20250223
Finding himself not happy in that which pleased his fancy_ he resolved next to try that which would please the palate_ v,20250223
First_ They are now proud that they can turn away from God and get clear of the restraints of religion; but that very thing shall slay them_ the remembrance of it shall cut them to the heart. Secondly_ They are now proud of their own security and sensuality; but the ease of the simple (so the margin reads it) shall slay them; the more secure they are the more certain and the more dreadful will their destruction be_ and the prosperity of fools shall help to destroy them_ by puffing them up with pride_ gluing their hearts to the world_ furnishing them with fuel for their lusts_ and hardening their hearts in their evil ways.,20250223
Five times they had spoken_ and every speech was a double reproach. He spoke as if he had kept a particular account of their reproaches_ and could tell just how many they were. It is but a peevish and unfriendly thing to do so_ and looks like a design of retaliation and revenge. We better befriend our own peace by forgetting injuries and unkindnesses than by remembering them and scoring them up,20250223
Fix God's law_ and his commandments_ as our rule_ by which we will in every thing be ruled and to which we will yield obedience. ,20250223
Flatterers may please those for a time who_ upon second thoughts_ will detest and despise them. If ever they come to be convinced of the evil of those sinful courses they were flattered in_ and to be ashamed of the pride and vanity which were humoured and gratified by those flatteries_ they will hate the fawning flatterers as having had an ill design upon them_ and the fulsome flatteries as having had an ill effect upon them and become nauseous,20250223
Fleshly lusts are called youthful lusts (2 Tim. ii. not to extenuate them as tricks of youth_ and therefore excusable_ but rather to aggravate them_ as robbing God of the first and best of our time_ and_ by debauching the mind when it is tender_ laying a foundation for a bad life ever after_ and to intimate that young people ought in a special manner to fortify their resolutions against this sin,20250223
Folly and Pride Exposed.,20250223
Folly and Wickedness.,20250223
Folly and sin are the shame of bad men: A rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding—of him that wants a heart; he exposes himself to the lashes of his own conscience_ to the scourges of the tongue_ to the censures of the magistrate_ and to the righteous judgments of God. Those that foolishly and wilfully go on in wicked ways are preparing rods for themselves_ the marks of which will be their perpetual disgrace.,20250223
Food convenient for his body. Having prayed for the operations of divine grace_ he here begs the favours of the divine Providence_ but such as may tend to the good and not to the prejudice of the soul. ,20250223
Food: For they are life unto those that find them_ v,20250223
Foolish pride is the great make-bate. Would you know whence come wars and fightings? They come from this root of bitterness. Whatever hand other lusts may have in contention (passion_ envy_ covetousness)_ pride has the great hand; it is its pride that it will itself sow discord and needs no help. Pride makes men impatient of contradiction in either their opinions or their desires_ impatient of competition and rivalship_ impatient of contempt_ or any thing that looks like a slight_ and impatient of concession_ and receding_ from a conceit of certain right and truth on their side; and hence arise quarrels among relations and neighbours_ quarrels in states and kingdoms_ in churches and Christian societies. Men will be revenged_ will not forgive_ because they are proud,20250223
Fools that hate knowledge. None but fools hate knowledge. Those only are enemies to religion that do not understand it aright. And those are the worst of fools that hate to be instructed and reformed_ and have a rooted antipathy to serious godliness. ,20250223
Fools toil a great deal to no purpose (v. 15); The labour of the foolish_ to accomplish their designs_ wearies every one of them. 1. They weary themselves in that labour which is very foolish and absurd. All their labour is for the world and the body_ and the meat that perishes_ and in this labour they spend their strength_ and exhaust their spirits_ and weary themselves for very vanity_,20250223
For Job hath said_ I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. 6 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression. 7 What man is like Job_ who drinketh up scorning like water? 8 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity_ and walketh with wicked men. 9 For he hath said_ It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.,20250223
For a check to proud oppressors_ and to show them their vanity_ he reminds them,20250223
For a remedy against those vanities_ he prescribes the fear of God_ ver,20250223
For causeless obstinacy. What emboldeneth thee_ that thou answerest? It is a great piece of confidence_ and unaccountable_ to charge men with those crimes which we cannot prove upon them_ to pass a judgment on men's spiritual state upon the view of their outward condition_ and to re-advance those objections which have been again and again answered_ as Eliphaz did,20250223
For disowning the benefits and advantages of religion because he suffered these things: What profit shall I have if I be cleansed from my sin? v,20250223
For endless impertinence. Job wishes that vain words might have an end_,20250223
For he delights the innocent to try_,20250223
For he with mournful eyes had often spied_,20250223
For her own part: __I raised thee up under the apple tree_ that is_ I have many a time wrestled with thee by prayer and have prevailed. When I was alone in the acts of devotion_ retired in the orchard_ under the apple-tree__ (which Christ himself was compared to_ ch. ii. as Nathanael under the fig-tree (John i.,20250223
For her quicksightedness (v. 29): Her eyes behold afar off_ not upwards_ but downwards_ in quest of her prey. In this she is an emblem of a hypocrite_ who_ while_ in the profession of religion_ he seems to rise towards heaven_ keeps his eye and heart upon the prey on earth_ some temporal advantage_ some widow's house or other that he hopes to devour_ under pretence of devotion. ,20250223
For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me. 17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me_ and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me. 18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost_ and no eye had seen me! 19 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 20 Are not my days few? cease then_ and let me alone_ that I may take comfort a little_ 21 Before I go whence I shall not return_ even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; 22 A land of darkness_ as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death_ without any order_ and where the light is as darkness.,20250223
For needless repetitions (v. 2): __I have heard many such things. You tell me nothing but what I knew before_ nothing but what you yourselves have before said; you offer nothing new; it is the same thing over and over again.__ This Job thinks as great a trial of his patience as almost any of his troubles. The inculcating of the same things thus by an adversary is indeed provoking and nauseous_ but by a teacher it is often necessary_ and must not be grievous to the learner_ to whom precept must be upon precept_ and line upon line. Many things we have heard which it is good for us to hear again_ that we may understand and remember them better_ and be more affected with them and influenced by them,20250223
For our encouragement to do this_ it is promised_ __He shall direct thy paths_ so that thy way shall be safe and good and the issue happy at last.__ Note_ Those that put themselves under a divine guidance shall always have the benefit of it. God will give them that wisdom which is profitable to direct_ so that they shall not turn aside into the by-paths of sin_ and then will himself so wisely order the event that it shall be to their mind_ or (which is equivalent) for their good. Those that faithfully follow the pillar of cloud and fire shall find that though it may lead them about it leads them the right way and will bring them to Canaan at last.,20250223
For our own comfort. Let us make ourselves easy_ rejoice_ and enjoy the good of our labour_ as it is the gift of God_ and so enjoy God in it_ and taste his love_ return him thanks_ and make him the centre of our joy_ eat and drink to his glory_ and serve him with joyfulness of heart_ in the abundance of all things. If all things in this world be so uncertain_ it is a foolish thing for men sordidly to spare for the present_ that they may hoard up all for hereafter; it is better to live cheerfully and usefully upon what we have_ and let to-morrow take thought for the things of itself. Grace and wisdom to do this is the gift of God_ and it is a good gift_ which crowns the gifts of his providential bounty.,20250223
For particular believers. Note_ ,20250223
For running_ drawing_ and carrying_ no creature that is ordinarily in the service of man has so much strength as the horse has_ nor is of so stout and bold a spirit_ not to be made afraid as a grasshopper_ but daring and forward to face danger. It is a mercy to man to have such a servant_ which_ though very strong_ submits to the management of a child_ and rebels not against his owner. But let not the strength of a horse be trusted to_ Hos. xiv. 3; Ps. xx. 7; Isa. xxxi. 1_ 3,20250223
For speaking so well on the matter about which Job and he were agreed. If we would all get our hearts filled with awful thoughts of God and humble thoughts of ourselves_ we should not be so apt as we are to fall out about matters of doubtful disputation_ which are trifling or intricate.,20250223
For the benefit of others. All the good there is in them is to do good with them_ to our families_ to our neighbours_ to the poor_ to the public_ to its civil and religious interests. What have we our beings_ capacities_ and estates for_ but to be some way serviceable to our generation? We mistake if we think we were born for ourselves. No; it is our business to do good; it is in doing good that there is the truest pleasure_ and what is so laid out is best laid up and will turn to the best account. Observe_ It is to do good in this life_ which is short and uncertain; we have but a little time to be doing good in_ and therefore had need to redeem time. It is in this life_ where we are in a state of trial and probation for another life. Every man's life is his opportunity of doing that which will make for him in eternity,20250223
For the checking and restraining of pomp and luxury. What is for necessity is had with a little labour from the surface of the earth; but what is for ornament must be dug with a great deal of pains out of the bowels of it. To be fed is cheap_ but to be fine is chargeable.,20250223
For the church in general_ that there may be a plentiful effusion of the Spirit upon it_ in order to its flourishing estate. Ministers' gifts are the spices; when the Spirit is poured out these flow forth_ and then the wilderness becomes a fruitful field_ Isa. xxxii,20250223
For the exciting and engaging of industry. Dii laboribus omnia vendunt—Labour is the price which the gods affix to all things. If valuable things were too easily obtained men would never learn to take pains. But the difficulty of gaining the riches of this earth may suggest to us what violence the kingdom of heaven suffers. ,20250223
For the height of her flight. No bird soars so high_ has so strong a wind_ nor can so well bear the light of the sun. Now_ __Doth she mount at thy command?,20250223
For the humbling of Job_ God here shows him his ignorance even concerning the earth and the sea. Though so near_ though so bulky_ yet he could give no account of their origination_ much less of heaven above or hell beneath_ which are at such a distance_ or of the several parts of matter which are so minute_ and then_ least of all_ of the divine counsels.,20250223
For the lions_ v. 39_ 40. __Thou dost not pretend that the clouds and stars have any dependence upon thee_ for they are above thee; but on the earth thou thinkest thyself paramount; let us try that then: Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? Thou valuest thyself upon thy possessions of cattle which thou wast once owner of_ the oxen_ and asses_ and camels_ that were fed at thy crib; but wilt thou undertake the maintenance of the lions_ and the young lions_ when they couch in their dens_ waiting for a prey? No_ needest not do it_ they can shift for themselves without thee: thou canst not do it_ for thou hast not wherewithal to satisfy them: thou darest not do it; shouldst thou come to feed them_ they would seize upon thee. But I do it.__ See the all-sufficiency of the divine providence: it has wherewithal to satisfy the desire of every living thing_ even the most ravenous. See the bounty of the divine Providence_ that_ wherever it has given life_ it will give livelihood_ even to those creatures that are not only not serviceable_ but dangerous_ to man. And see its sovereignty_ that it suffers some creatures to be killed for the support of other creatures. The harmless sheep are torn to pieces_ to fill the appetite of the young lions_ who yet sometimes are made to lack and suffer hunger_ to punish them for their cruelty_ while those that fear God want no good thing,20250223
For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing_ neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. 6 Also their love_ and their hatred_ and their envy_ is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. 7 Go thy way_ eat thy bread with joy_ and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works. 8 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment. 9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity_ which he hath given thee under the sun_ all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life_ and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun. 10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do_ do it with thy might; for there is no work_ nor device_ nor knowledge_ nor wisdom_ in the grave_ whither thou goest.,20250223
For the managing of the public quarrels_ so as not to engage in them but for an honest cause and with some probability of success_ and_ when they are engaged in_ to manage them well_ and so as to make either an advantageous peace or an honourable retreat: By wise counsel thou shalt make war_ which is a thing that may prove of ill consequence if not done by wise counsel. ,20250223
For the proof of this_ that wicked people prosper_ Job specifies two sorts of unrighteous ones_ whom all the world saw thriving in their iniquity:—,20250223
For the right understanding of divine Providence_ and the unfolding of the difficulties of it_ it will be of use to compare the observations and experiences of former ages with the events of our own day; and_ in order thereto_ to consult history_ especially the sacred history_ which is the most ancient_ infallibly true_ and written designedly for our learning. ,20250223
For the righteous to fall into sin in the sight of the wicked—for them to do any thing unbecoming their profession_ which is told in Gath_ and published in the streets of Ashkelon_ and in which the daughters of the Philistines rejoice. For those that have been in reputation for wisdom and honour to fall from their excellency_ this troubles the fountains by grieving some_ and corrupts the springs by infecting others and emboldening them to do likewise.,20250223
For the sake of our own comfort: Whoso keeps the commandment_ and lives a quiet and peaceable life_ shall feel no evil thing_ to which that of the apostle answers (Rom. xiii.,20250223
For the securing of the public peace: In the multitude of counsellors there is safety_ for one may foresee the danger_ and discern the advantages_ which another cannot. In our spiritual conflicts we need wisdom_ for our enemy is subtle.,20250223
For the strength of her nest. Her house is her castle and strong-hold; she makes it on high and on the rock_ the crag of the rock (v. which sets her and her young out of the reach of danger. Secure sinners think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on high_ in the clefts of the rock; but I will bring thee down thence_ saith the Lord_ Jer. xlix,20250223
For the truths are here of such certainty and weight that they cannot be too often inculcated. Let us govern ourselves by these principles.,20250223
For the violation of the sacred laws of friendship_ doing by his brother as he would not have been done by and as his brother would not have done by him. This is a cutting reproof_ and very affecting_ v. 4_ 5. ,20250223
For the way she has of maintaining herself and her young. She preys upon living animals_ which she seizes and tears to pieces_ and thence carries to her young ones_ which are taught to suck up blood; they do it by instinct_ and know no better; but for men that have reason and conscience to thirst after blood is what could scarcely be believed if there had not been in every age wretched instances of it. She also preys upon the dead bodies of men: Where the slain are_ there is she_ These birds of prey (in another sense than the horse_ v. 25) smell the battle afar off. Therefore_ when a great slaughter is to be made among the enemies of the church_ the fowls are invited to the supper of the great God_ to eat the flesh of kings and captains_ Rev. xix. 17_ 18. Our Saviour refers to this instinct of the eagle_ Matt. xxiv,20250223
For the young ravens_ v,20250223
For their own feet; so some understand it. He that flatters others_ in expectation that they will return his compliments and flatter him_ does but make himself ridiculous and odious even to those he flatters.,20250223
For those that had actions unjustly brought against them_ to defraud them of their right_ because they were poor and needy_ and unable to defend it_ not having wherewithal to fee counsel; in such a case also kings must be advocates for the poor. Especially_ ,20250223
For those that were dumb_ and knew not how to speak for themselves_ either through weakness or fear_ or being over-talked by the prosecutor or over-awed by the court. It is generous to speak for those that cannot speak for themselves_ that are absent_ or have not words at command_ or are timorous. Our law appoints the judge to be of counsel for the prisoner.,20250223
For those that were unjustly charged with capital crimes_ as Naboth was_ that were appointed to destruction_ to gratify the malice either of a particular person or of a party. It is a case which it well befits a king to appear in_ for the preserving of innocent blood. ,20250223
For those whom he has not honour from he will get himself honour upon. Let us therefore stand in awe and not sin_ for it will certainly be bitterness in the latter end.,20250223
For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity_ and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. 6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee_ and not I: yea_ thine own lips testify against thee. 7 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills? 8 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 9 What knowest thou_ that we know not? what understandest thou_ which is not in us? 10 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men_ much elder than thy father. 11 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee? 12 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at_ 13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God_ and lettest such words go out of thy mouth? 14 What is man_ that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman_ that he should be righteous? 15 Behold_ he putteth no trust in his saints; yea_ the heavens are not clean in his sight. 16 How much more abominable and filthy is man_ which drinketh iniquity like water?,20250223
For unskilful applications. They came with a design to comfort him_ but they went about it very awkwardly_ and_ when they touched Job's case_ quite mistook it: __Miserable comforters are you all_ who_ instead of offering any thing to alleviate the affliction_ add affliction to it_ and make it yet more grievous.__ The patient's case is sad indeed when his medicines are poisons and his physicians his worst disease. What Job says here of his friends is true of all creatures_ in comparison with God_ and_ one time or other_ we shall be made to see it and own it_ that miserable comforters are they all. When we are under convictions of sin_ terrors of conscience_ and the arrests of death_ it is only the blessed Spirit that can comfort effectually; all others_ without him_ do it miserably_ and sing songs to a heavy heart_ to no purpose,20250223
For want of natural affection (v. 16): She is hardened against her young ones. To be hardened against any is unamiable_ even in a brute-creature_ much more in a rational creature that boasts of humanity_ especially to be hardened against young ones_ that cannot help themselves and therefore merit compassion_ that give no provocation and therefore merit no hard usage: but it is worst of all for her to be hardened against her own young ones_ as though they were not hers_ whereas really they are parts of herself. Her labour in laying her eggs is in vain and all lost_ because she has not that fear and tender concern for them that she should have. Those are most likely to lose their labour that are least in fear of losing it. ,20250223
For want of wisdom (v. 17): God has deprived her of wisdom. This intimates that the art which other animals have to nourish and preserve their young is God's gift_ and that_ where it exists not_ God denies it_ that by the folly of the ostrich_ as well as by the wisdom of the ant_ we may learn to be wise; for_ First_ As careless as the ostrich is of her eggs so careless many people are of their own souls; they make no provision for them_ no proper nest in which they may be safe_ leave them exposed to Satan and his temptations_ which is a certain evidence that they are deprived of wisdom. Secondly_ So careless are many parents of their children; some of their bodies_ not providing for their own house_ their own bowels_ and therefore worse than infidels_ and as bad as the ostrich; but many more are thus careless of their children's souls_ take no care of their education_ send them abroad into the world untaught_ unarmed_ forgetting what corruption there is in the world through lust_ which will certainly crush them. Thus their labour in rearing them comes to be in vain; it were better for their country that they had never been born. Thirdly_ So careless are too many ministers of their people_ with whom they should reside; but they leave them in the earth_ and forget how busy Satan is to sow tares while men sleep. They overlook those whom they should oversee_ and are really hardened against them.,20250223
For what end they were written (v. 2-4)_ not to gain a reputation to the author_ or strengthen his interest among his subjects_ but for the use and benefit of all that in every age and place will govern themselves by these dictates and study them closely. This book will help us,20250223
For whose use they were written_ They are of use to all_ but are designed especially_,20250223
For wrath's sake_ because of the sword which the prince bears and the power he is entrusted with_ which make him formidable: He does whatsoever pleases him; he has a great authority and a great ability to support that authority (v. 4): Where the word of a king is_ giving orders to seize a man_ there is power; there are many that will execute his orders_ which makes the wrath of a king_ or supreme government_ like the roaring of a lion and like messengers of death. Who may say unto him_ What doest thou? He that contradicts him does it at his peril. Kings will not bear to have their orders disputed_ but expect they should be obeyed. In short_ it is dangerous contending with sovereignty_ and what many have repented. A subject is an unequal match for a prince. He may command me who has legions at command. ,20250223
For_  There is labour in getting knowledge_ ver There is little good to be done with it_ ver There is no satisfaction in it_ ver And_ if this is vanity and vexation_ all other things in this world_ being much inferior to it in dignity and worth_ must needs be so too. A great scholar cannot be happy unless he be a true saint.,20250223
For_ though a wife that is continually finding fault may think it is her wit and wisdom to be so_ it is really her folly; a prudent wife is meek and quiet_ and makes the best of every thing. If a man has such a wife_ let him not ascribe it to the wisdom of his own choice or his own management (for the wisest have been deceived both in and by a woman)_ but let him ascribe it to the goodness of God_ who made him a help meet for him_ and perhaps by some hits and turns of providence that seemed casual brought her to him. Every creature is what he makes it. Happy marriages_ we are sure_ are made in heaven; Abraham's servant prayed in the belief of this_ Gen. xxiv. 12,20250223
Forgetfulness of God is at the bottom of men's hypocrisy_ and of the vain hopes with which they flatter and deceive themselves in their hypocrisy. Men would not be hypocrites if they did not forget that the God with whom they have to do searches the heart and requires truth there_ that he is a Spirit and has his eye on our spirits; and hypocrites would have no hope if they did not forget that God is righteous_ and will not be mocked with the torn and the lame. ,20250223

Four Things Little and Wise.,20250223
Four Things Majestic and Stately.,20250223
Four Things Unsearchable.,20250223
Four Wicked Generations.,20250223
Four articles more of Job's protestation we have in these verses_ which_ as all the rest_ not only assure us what he was and did_ but teach us what we should be and do:—,20250223
Four things insatiable (ver. 15_ to which is added fair warning to undutiful children_ ver. 17.,20250223
Four things intolerable_ ver. 21-23.,20250223
Four things little and wise_ ver. 24-28.,20250223
Four things stately_ ver. 29 to the end.,20250223
Four things unsearchable_ ver. 18-20.,20250223
Four things we are exhorted to in these verses:—,20250223
Four wicked generations_ ver. 11-14.,20250223
Fourthly_ He must stick to them and abide by them: __Decline not from the words of my mouth (v. as fearing they will be too great a check upon thee_ but take fast hold of instruction (v. as being resolved to keep thy hold and never let it go.__ Those that have a good education_ though they strive to shake it off_ will find it hang about them a great while_ and_ if it do not_ their case is very sad.,20250223
Framing ill designs will be of no advantage to us; there is nothing got by them: He that has a froward heart_ that sows discord and is full of resentment_ cannot promise himself to get by it sufficient to counterbalance the loss of his repose and reputation_ nor can he take any rational satisfaction in it; he finds no good,20250223
Fraud and injustice in commerce_ ver. 4-8,20250223
Frequently those that most need severe rebukes can worse bear them. Such is the corruption of nature that men are as loth to be rebuked sharply for their sins as to be beaten till their bones ache. Correction is grievous to him that forsakes the way_ and yet it is good for him_ Heb. xii. 11.,20250223
From all this he infers that the right knowledge of those things_ such as transforms us into the image of them_ is to be preferred before all the wealth of this world (v. 10_ 11): Receive my instruction_ and not silver. Instruction must not only be heard_ but received. We must bid it welcome_ receive the impressions of it_ and submit to the command of it; and this rather than choice gold_ that is,20250223
From all this it is easy to infer that_ since God is great_ he is greatly to be feared; nay_ because he is gracious and will not afflict_ men do therefore fear him_ for there is forgiveness with him_ that he may be feared_ Ps. cxxx,20250223
From his cares_ looking forward_ v,20250223
From his conscience looking back_ and filling him with the fear of the wrath of God against him for his wickedness. Even that wickedness which was sweet in the commission_ and was rolled under the tongue as a delicate morsel_ becomes bitter in the reflection_ and_ when it is reviewed_ fills him with horror and vexation. In his bowels it is turned (v. 14) like John's book_ in his mouth as sweet as honey_ but_ when he had eaten it_ his belly was bitter_ Rev. x,20250223
From his own condition at this time. He had as much reason_ he thought_ to wish for death_ as a poor servant or hireling that is tired with his work has to wish for the shadows of the evening_ when he shall receive his penny and go to rest_ v,20250223
From his own experience and observation: __That which I have myself seen_ in divers instances_ I will declare.__ It is of good use to take notice of the providences of God concerning the children of men_ from which many a good lesson may be learned. What good observations we have made_ and have found benefit by ourselves_ we should be ready to communicate for the benefit of others; and we may speak boldly when we declare what we have seen,20250223
From men of corrupt principles_ atheistical profane men_ who make it their business to debauch young men's judgments_ and instil into their minds prejudices against religion and arguments for vice: __It will deliver thee from the way of the evil man (v. and a blessed deliverance it will be_ as from the very jaws of death_ from the way in which he walks_ and in which he would persuade thee to walk.__ The enemy is spoken of as one (v. an evil man_ but afterwards as many (v. 13); there is a club_ a gang of them_ that are in confederacy against religion_ and join hand in hand for the support of the devil's kingdom and the interests of it. ,20250223
From our house under ground (v. 9): He that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more until the general resurrection_ shall come up no more to his place in this world. Dying is work that is to be done but once_ and therefore it had need be well done: an error there is past retrieve. This is illustrated by the blotting out and scattering of a cloud. It is consumed and vanisheth away_ is resolved into air and never knits again. Other clouds arise_ but the same cloud never returns: so a new generation of the children of men is raised up_ but the former generation is quite consumed and vanishes away. When we see a cloud which looks great_ as if it would eclipse the sun and drawn the earth_ of a sudden dispersed and disappearing_ let us say_ __Just such a thing is the life of man; it is a vapour that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.__ ,20250223
From the abundant toil man has about them and the little satisfaction he has in them_ ver. 8,20250223
From the charge of cowardice and base fear. His courage in that which is good he produces as an evidence of his sincerity in it (v. 34): Did I fear a great multitude_ that I kept silence? No_ all that knew Job knew him to be a man of undaunted resolution in a good cause_ that boldly appeared_ spoke_ and acted_ in defence of religion and justice_ and did not fear the face of man nor was ever threatened or brow-beaten out of his duty_ but set his face as a flint. Observe,20250223
From the charge of oppression and violence_ and doing wrong to his poor neighbours. And here observe_,20250223
From the inconstant nature_ and constant revolutions_ of all the creatures_ and the perpetual flux and reflux they are in_ the sun_ wind_ and water_ ver. 5-7,20250223
From the oblivion to which all things are condemned_ ver. 11.,20250223
From the return of the same things again_ which shows the end of all perfection_ and that the stock is exhausted_ ver. 9_ 10,20250223
From the shortness of human life and the multitude of births and burials in this life_ ver.,20250223
From the wisdom of the ancients (v. 18): Which wise men have told from their fathers. Note_ The wisdom and learning of the moderns are very much derived from those of the ancients. Good children will learn a good deal from their good parents; and what we have learned from our ancestors we must transmit to our posterity and not hide from the generations to come. See Ps.,20250223
From this instance he draws some useful inferences_ looks upon it and receives instruction.,20250223
From women of corrupt practices. The former lead to spiritual wickednesses_ the lusts of the unsanctified mind; these lead to fleshly lusts_ which defile the body_ that living temple_ but withal war against the soul. The adulteress is here called the strange woman_ because no man that has any wisdom or goodness in him will have any acquaintance with her; she is to be shunned by every Israelite as if she were a heathen_ and a stranger to that sacred commonwealth. A strange woman indeed! utterly estranged from all principles of reason_ virtue_ and honour. It is a great mercy to be delivered from the allurements of the adulteress_ considering_ ,20250223
Frowardness is in his heart_ he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. 15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. 16 These six things doth the Lord hate: yea_ seven are an abomination unto him: 17 A proud look_ a lying tongue_ and hands that shed innocent blood_ 18 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations_ feet that be swift in running to mischief_ 19 A false witness that speaketh lies_ and he that soweth discord among brethren.,20250223
Further to evince this he here shows_ ,20250223
Get dominion over thy corruptions_ which are thy follies: get possession of wise principles and the habits of wisdom. Get wisdom by experience_ get it above all thy getting; be more in care and take more pains to get this than to get the wealth of this world; whatever thou forgettest_ get this_ reckon it a great achievement_ and pursue it accordingly.__ True wisdom is God's gift_ and yet we are here commanded to get it_ because God gives it to those that labour for it; yet_ after all_ we must not say_ Our might and the power of our hand have gotten us this wealth. Secondly_ Forget her not (v. forsake her not (v. let her not go (v. but keep her. Those that have got this wisdom must take heed of losing it again by returning to folly: it is indeed a good part_ that shall not be taken from us; but then we must take heed lest we throw it from us_ as those do that forget it first_ and let it slip out of their minds_ and then forsake it and turn out of its good ways. That good thing which is committed to us we must keep_ and not let it drop_ through carelessness_ nor suffer it to be forced from us_ nor suffer ourselves to be wheedled out of it; never let go such a jewel. Thirdly_ Love her (v. and embrace her (v. as worldly men love their wealth and set their hearts upon it. Religion should be very dear to us_ dearer than any thing in this world; and_ if we cannot reach to be great masters of wisdom_ yet let us be true lovers of it; and what grace we have let us embrace it with a sincere affection_ as those that admire its beauty. Fourthly_ __Exalt her_ v,20250223
Get wisdom_ get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. 6 Forsake her not_ and she shall preserve thee: love her_ and she shall keep thee. 7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. 8 Exalt her_ and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour_ when thou dost embrace her. 9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. 10 Hear_ O my son_ and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. 11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. 12 When thou goest_ thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest_ thou shalt not stumble. 13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.,20250223
Get you to the gods whom you have served_ Judg. x,20250223
Give freely to the poor_ as that which is cast upon the waters. Send it a voyage_ send it as a venture_ as merchants that trade by sea. Trust it upon the waters; it shall not sink.__,20250223
Give_ and it shall be given you,20250223
Giving an entire consent to Christ: __He is mine_ my Lord and my God (John xx. mine according to the tenour of the gospel-covenant_ mine in all relations_ bestowed upon me_ to be all that to me that my poor soul stands in need of.__ ,20250223
Giving ill language will be a great disadvantage to us: He that has a perverse tongue_ spiteful and abusive_ scurrilous or backbiting_ falls into one mischief or other_ loses his friends_ provokes his enemies_ and pulls trouble upon his own head. Many a one has paid dearly for an unbridled tongue.,20250223
Glad that he had gained his point_ proud of the permission he had to do mischief to a good man; and_ 2. Resolved to lose no time_ but speedily to put his project in execution. He went forth now_ not to go to and fro_ rambling through the earth_ but with a direct course_ to fall upon poor Job_ who is carefully going on in the way of his duty_ and knows nothing of the matter. What passes between good and bad spirits concerning us we are not aware of.,20250223
Go forth and behold him; go off from the world_ as those that see no beauty and excellency in it in comparison with what is to be seen in the Lord Jesus. Go out of yourselves_ and let the light of his transcendent beauty put you out of conceit with yourselves. Go forth to the place where he is to be seen_ to the street through which he passes_ as Zaccheus.,20250223

God and godliness_ and are therefore vexed to see good men in power and prosperity; but all indifferent persons_ even those that have no great stock of religion themselves_ have a good word for a good man; and therefore when it goes well with the righteous_ when they are advanced and put into a capacity of doing good according to their desire_ it is so much the better for all about them_ and the city rejoices. For the honour and encouragement of virtue_ and as it is the accomplishment of the promise of God_ we should be glad to see virtuous men prosper in the world_ and brought into reputation,20250223
God at a distance. Secondly_ Their calamity will put them into a great fright. Fear seizes them_ and they apprehend that bad will be worse. When public judgments are abroad the sinners in Zion are afraid_ fearfulness surprises the hypocrites. Death is the king of terrors to them (Job xv. 21_ &c.; xviii. 11_ &c.); this fear will be their continual torment. Thirdly_ According to their fright will it be to them. Their fear shall come (the thing they were afraid of shall befal them); it shall come as desolation_ as a mighty deluge bearing down all before it; it shall be their destruction_ their total and final destruction; and it shall come as a whirlwind_ which suddenly and forcibly drives away all the chaff. Note_ Those that will not admit the fear of God lay themselves open to all other fears_ and their fears will not prove causeless. Fourthly_ Their fright will then be turned into despair: Distress and anguish shall come upon them_ for_ having fallen into the pit they were afraid of_ they shall see no way to escape_ ,20250223
God begins with a challenge (v. as before (ch. xxxviii. 3): __Gird up thy loins now like a man; if thou hast the courage and confidence thou hast pretended to_ show them now; but thou wilt soon be made to see and own thyself no match for me.__ This is that which every proud heart must be brought to at last_ either by its repentance or by its ruin; and thus low must every mountain and hill be_ sooner or later_ brought. We must acknowledge_,20250223
God calls him again and again his servant Job_ four times in two verses_ and he seems to take a pleasure in calling him so_ as before his troubles (ch. i.,20250223
God can and does easily abase proud tyrants; he can look upon them_ and bring them low_ can overwhelm them with shame_ and fear_ and utter ruin_ by one angry look_ as he can_ by a gracious look_ revive the hearts of the contrite ones. ,20250223
God can ask a thousand puzzling questions which those that quarrel with him_ and arraign his proceedings_ cannot give an answer to. When God spoke to Job out of the whirlwind he asked him a great many questions (Dost thou know this? Canst thou do that?) to none of which Job could give an answer_ ch. xxxviii._ xxxix. God can easily manifest the folly of the greatest pretenders to wisdom. ,20250223
God can bring forth the stars to battle (as he did when in their courses they fought against Sisera) and guide them in the attacks they are ordered to make; but man cannot do so,20250223
God can change men's minds_ can_ by a powerful insensible operation under their spirits_ turn them from that which they seemed most intent upon_ and incline them to that which they seemed most averse to_ as the husbandman_ by canals and gutters_ turns the water through his grounds as he pleases_ which does not alter the nature of the water_ nor put any force upon it_ any more than God's providence does upon the native freedom of man's will_ but directs the course of it to serve his own purpose,20250223
God can lay to our charge a thousand offences_ can draw up against us a thousand articles of impeachment_ and we cannot answer him so as to acquit ourselves from the imputation of any of them_ but must_ by silence_ give consent that they are all true. We cannot set aside one as foreign_ another as frivolous_ and another as false. We cannot_ as to one_ deny the fact_ and plead not guilty_ and_ as to another_ deny the fault_ confess and justify. No_ we are not able to answer him_ but must lay our hand upon our mouth_ as Job did (ch. xl. 4_,20250223
God can turn foes into friends when he pleases. He that has all hearts in his hand has access to men's spirits and power over them_ working insensibly_ but irresistibly upon them_ can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him_ can change their minds_ or force them into a feigned submission. He can slay all enemies_ and bring those together that were at the greatest distance from each other,20250223
God charges him with ignorance and presumption in what he had said (v. 2): __Who is this that talks at this rate? Is it Job? What! a man? That weak_ foolish_ despicable_ creature—shall he pretend to prescribe to me what I must do or to quarrel with me for what I have done? Is it Job? What! my servant Job_ a perfect and an upright man? Can he so far forget himself_ and act unlike himself? Who_ where_ is he that darkens counsel thus by words without knowledge? Let him show his face if he dare_ and stand to what he has said.__ Note_ Darkening the counsels of God's wisdom with our folly is a great affront and provocation to God. Concerning God's counsels we must own that we are without knowledge. They are a deep which we cannot fathom; we are quite out of our element_ out of our aim_ when we pretend to account for them. Yet we are too apt to talk of them as if we understood them_ with a great deal of niceness and boldness; but_ alas! we do but darken them_ instead of explaining them. We confound and perplex ourselves and one another when we dispute of the order of God's decrees_ and the designs_ and reasons_ and methods_ of his operations of providence and grace. A humble faith and sincere obedience shall see further and better into the secret of the Lord than all the philosophy of the schools_ and the searches of science_ so called. This first word which God spoke is the more observable because Job_ in his repentance_ fastens upon it as that which silenced and humbled him_ ch. xlii,20250223
God communicates his favour and grace to his people_ and receives the return of their devotion in a way secret to the world. Some read it_ When the society of God was in my tabernacle_ which Rabbi Solomon understands of an assembly of God's people that used to meet at Job's house for religious worship_ in which he presided; this he took a great deal of pleasure in_ and the scattering of it was a trouble to him. Or it may be understood of the angels of God pitching their tents about his habitation,20250223
God did now take cognizance of his sorrows: My eye pours out tears to God. He had said (v. 16) that he wept much; here he tells us in what channel his tears ran_ and which way they were directed. His sorrow was not that of the world_ but he sorrowed after a godly sort_ wept before the Lord_ and offered to him the sacrifice of a broken heart. Note_ Even tears_ when sanctified to God_ give ease to troubled spirits; and_ if men slight our grief_ this may comfort us_ that God regards them. ,20250223
God disposes of men's estates as he pleases_ and often makes their wills against their wills. The just_ whom he hated and persecuted_ shall have rule over all his labour_ and_ in due time_ recover with interest what was violently taken from him. The Egyptians' jewels were the Israelites' pay. Solomon observes (Eccl.,20250223
God doeth great things in the kingdom of nature: He gives rain upon the earth (v. put here for all the gifts of common providence_ all the fruitful seasons by which he filleth our hearts with food and gladness_ Acts xiv,20250223
God doubled his possessions: Also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. It is probable that he did at first_ in some way or other_ intimate to him that it was his gracious purpose_ by degrees_ in due time to bring him to such a height of prosperity that he should have twice as much as ever he had_ for the encouraging of his hope and the quickening of his industry_ and that it might appear that this wonderful increase was a special token of God's favour. And it may be considered as intended_ ,20250223
God expect it. He looks upon men_ when they have sinned_ to see what they will do next_ whether they will go on in it or whether they will bethink themselves and return. He hearkens and hears whether any say_ What have I done? Jer. viii,20250223
God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. 6 My righteousness I hold fast_ and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.,20250223
God governs the world_ and therefore we may be sure he takes cognizance of it. Bad times are not hidden from him_ though the bad men that make the times bad say one to another_ He has forsaken the earth_ Ps. xciv. 6_ 7. Every man's times are in his hand_ and under his eye_ and therefore it is in his power to make the times of wicked men in this world miserable. He foresees the time of every man's death_ and therefore_ if wicked men die before they are punished for their wickedness_ we cannot say_ __They escaped him by surprise;__ he foresaw it_ nay_ he ordered it. Before Job will enquire into the reasons of the prosperity of wicked men he asserts God's omniscience_ as one prophet_ in a similar case_ asserts his righteousness (Jer.,20250223
God had challenged Job to look upon proud men and abase them. __I cannot___ says Job_ __pretend to do it; I have enough to do to get my own proud heart humbled_ to abase that and bring that low.__ Let us leave it to God to govern the world_ and make it our care_ in the strength of his grace_ to govern ourselves and our own hearts well.,20250223
God has enough for all_ and wonderfully provides even for those creatures that man neither has service from nor makes provision for.,20250223
God has found out a way to deliver his people even when they have despaired and their enemies have triumphed_ as if the wilderness had shut them in,20250223
God has opened my ear_ and I was not rebellious,20250223
God has spoken once to sinners by their own consciences_ to keep them from the paths of the destroyer_ but they perceive it not; they are not aware that the checks their own hearts give them in a sinful way are from God_ but they are imputed to melancholy or the preciseness of their education; and therefore God speaks twice; he speaks a second time_ and tries another way to convince and reclaim sinners_ and that is by providences_ afflictive and merciful (in which he speaks twice)_ and by the seasonable instructions of good ministers setting in with them. Job complained much of his diseases and judged by them that God was angry with him; his friends did so too: but Elihu shows that they were all mistaken_ for God often afflicts the body in love_ and with gracious designs of good to the soul_ as appears in the issue. This part of Elihu's discourse will be of great use to us for the due improvement of sickness_ in and by which God speaks to men. Here is_,20250223
God has such a love for upright good people that_ though they are not at the expense of a sacrifice (he himself has provided that)_ their prayer is a delight to him. Praying graces are his own gift_ and the work of his own Spirit in them_ with which he is well pleased. He not only answers their prayers_ but delights in their addresses to him_ and in doing them good.,20250223
God has the command of the waters_ binds them as in a garment (Prov. xxx. holds them in the hollow of his hand (Isa.,20250223
God has the stars of heaven under his command and cognizance_ but we have them not under ours. Our meditations are now to rise higher_ far above the clouds_ to the glorious lights above. God mentions particularly_ not the planets_ which move in lower orbs_ but the fixed stars_ which are much higher. It is supposed that they have an influence upon this earth_ notwithstanding their vast distance_ not upon the minds of men or the events of providence (men's fate is not determined by their stars)_ but upon the ordinary course of nature; they are set for signs and seasons_ for days and years_ Gen. i,20250223
God has wisely deposited the treasure in earthen vessels like ourselves_ 2 Cor. iv,20250223
God hears not such sinners. They have_ it may be_ brought themselves into trouble by their own wickedness; they are the devil's poor; and then who can pity them? Yet this is not all: they are proud still_ and therefore they do not seek unto God (Ps. x. or_ if they do cry unto him_ therefore he does not give answer_ for he hears only the desire of the humble (Ps. x. 17) and delivers those by his providence whom he has first by his grace prepared and made fit for deliverance_ which we are not if_ under humbling afflictions_ our hearts remain unhumbled and our pride unmortified. The case is plain then_ If we cry to God for the removal of the oppression and affliction we are under_ and it is not removed_ the reason is not because the Lord's hand is shortened or his ear heavy_ but because the affliction has not done its work; we are not sufficiently humbled_ and therefore must thank ourselves that it is continued.,20250223
God here shows Job what little acquaintance he had with the untamed creatures that run wild in the deserts and live at large_ but are the care of the divine Providence. As_,20250223
God himself shall be with them and be their God; they shall be like him_ for they shall see him as he is_ that is seeing for themselves_ 1 John iii,20250223
God himself will be the Judge_ God-man will_ not only because he has a right to judge_ but because he is perfectly fit for it_ infinitely wise and just,20250223
God himself. If we understand it of him_ the expressions are indeed as rash as any he used. God hates none of his creatures; but Job's melancholy did thus represent to him the terrors of the Almighty: and nothing can be more grievous to a good man than to apprehend God to be his enemy. If the wrath of a king be as messengers of death_ what is the wrath of the King of kings!,20250223
God is great_ and we know him not.,20250223
God is here pleased to interest himself more than one would imagine in the treatment given to the poor. 1. He reckons himself affronted in the injuries that are done them. Whosoever he be that wrongs a poor man_ taking advantage against him because he is poor and cannot help himself_ let him know that he puts an affront upon his Maker. God made him_ and gave him his being_ the same that is the author of our being; we have all one Father_ one Maker; see how Job considered this_ Job xxxi,20250223
God is higher than the highest of creatures_ than the highest of princes_ than the king that is higher than Agag (Num. xxiv. than the highest angels_ the thrones and dominions of the upper world. God is the Most High over all the earth_ and his glory is above the heavens; before him princes are worms_ the brightest but glow-worms. ,20250223
God is not obliged to give us a reason of what he does. The meanings of his proceedings we know no now; it will be time enough to know hereafter_ when it will appear that what seemed now to be done by prerogative was done in infinite wisdom and for the best. ,20250223
God is not wont to say to the seed of Jacob_ Seek you me in vain; and yet here we have the spouse for a great while seeking her beloved in vain_ but finding him at last_ to her unspeakable satisfaction. It was hard to the Old-Testament church to find Christ in the ceremonial law_ and the types and figures which then were of good things to come. Long was the consolation of Israel looked for before it came. The watchman of that church gave little assistance to those who enquired after him; but at length Simeon had him in his arms whom his soul loved. It is applicable to the case of particular believers_ who often walk in darkness a great while_ but at even time it shall be light_ and those that seek Christ to the end shall find him at length. Observe_,20250223
God is our Maker_ the author of our being_ and_ under that notion_ it concerns us to regard and remember him_ Eccl. xii.,20250223
God is pleased sometimes to manifest himself most fully to his people by the rebukes of his word and providence. __Now that I have been afflicted_ now that I have been told of my faults_ now my eye sees thee.__ The rod and reproof give wisdom. Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest and teachest.,20250223
God is said to have his way in the whirlwind (Nah. i. and_ to show that even the stormy wind fulfils his word_ here it was made the vehicle of it. This shows what a mighty voice God's is_ that is was not lost_ but perfectly audible_ even in the noise of a whirlwind. Thus God designed to startled Job_ and to command his attention. Sometimes God answers his own people in terrible corrections_ as out of the whirlwind_ but always in righteousness,20250223
God is the God of grace. It is he that gives the ear that hears God's voice_ they eye that sees his beauty_ for it is he that opens the understanding.,20250223
God is the God of nature_ and all the powers and faculties of nature are derived from him and depend upon him_ and therefore are to be employed for him. It was he that formed the eye and planted the ear (Ps. xciv. and the structure of both is admirable; and it is he that preserves to us the use of both; to his providence we owe it that our eyes are seeing eyes and our ears hearing ears. Hearing and seeing are the learning senses_ and must particularly own God's goodness in them,20250223
God is the author and giver_ the father and fountain_ of all wisdom and understanding_ v.,20250223
God is the sovereign Lord of all_ and with him is terrible majesty. Dominion and fear are with him_ v,20250223
God is to be acknowledged in it with thankfulness; it is a token of his favour_ and a happy pledge of further favours; it is a sign that God delights in a man to do him good and has mercy in store for him; for this_ therefore_ God must be sought unto.,20250223
God knew him better than he knew himself and therefore (v.,20250223
God knows a great deal more evil of us than we do of ourselves; so some understand it. When God gave David a sight and sense of sin he said that he had in the hidden part made him to know wisdom_ Ps. li. 6.,20250223
God made him poor_ and appointed him his lot_ so that_ if we deal hardly with any because they are poor_ we reflect upon God as dealing hardly with them in laying them low_ that they might be trampled upon,20250223
God makes some rich_ that they may be charitable to the poor_ and others poor_ that they may be serviceable to the rich; and they have need of one another_ 1 Cor. xii,20250223
God makes them a reward to a good man_ if with them he give him wisdom_ and knowledge_ and joy_ to enjoy them cheerfully himself and to communicate them charitably to others. To those who are good in God's sight_ who are of a good spirit_ honest and sincere_ pay a deference to their God and have a tender concern for all mankind_ God will give wisdom and knowledge in this world_ and joy with the righteous in the world to come; so the Chaldee. Or he will give that wisdom and knowledge in things natural_ moral_ political_ and divine_ which will be a constant joy and pleasure to them. ,20250223
God overruling. Various men have various designs_ according as their inclination or interest leads them_ but the counsel of the Lord_ that shall stand_ whatever becomes of the devices of men. His counsel often breaks men's measures and baffles their devices; but their devices cannot in the least alter his counsel_ not disturb the proceedings of it_ nor put him upon new counsels_ Isa. xiv. 24; xlvi,20250223
God places no confidence in saints and angels; he employs both_ but trusts neither with his service_ without giving them fresh supplies of strength and wisdom for it_ as knowing they are not sufficient of themselves_ neither more nor better than his grace makes them. He takes no complacency in the heavens themselves. How pure soever they seem to us_ in his eye they have many a speck and many a flaw: The heavens are not clean in his sight. If the stars (says Mr. Caryl) have no light in the sight of the sun_ what light has the sun in the sight of God! See Isa. xxiv,20250223
God ponders the heart and keeps the soul; he keeps an eye upon it_ observes all the motions of it; its most secret thoughts and intents are all naked and open before him. It is his prerogative to do so_ and that in which he glories. Jer. xvii. 10_ I the Lord search the heart. He keeps the soul_ holds it in life. This is a good reason why we should be tender of the lives of others_ and do all we can to preserve them_ because our lives have been precious in the sight of God and he has graciously kept them. ,20250223
God proceeds here to show Job what little reason he had to charge him with unkindness who was so compassionate to the inferior creatures and took such a tender care of them_ or to boast of himself_ and his own good deeds before God_ which were nothing to the divine mercies. He shows him also what great reason he had to be humble who knew so little of the nature of the creatures about him and had so little influence upon them_ and to submit to that God on whom they all depend. He discourses particularly_,20250223
God proceeds to reason with him_ for his conviction_ concerning the infinite distance and disproportion between him and God_ showing that he was by no means an equal match for God. He challenges him (ver. 6_ 7) to vie with him_ if he durst_ for justice (ver. power (ver. majesty (ver. and dominion over the proud (ver. 11-14)_ and he gives an instance of his power in one particular animal_ here called __Behemoth___ ver. 15-24.,20250223
God put it in their hearts to do so; and every creature is that to us which he makes it to be. Job had acknowledged God in their estrangement from him_ for which he now rewarded him in turning them to him again. ,20250223
God puts a convincing question to him: __Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? Shall he pretend to dictate to God's wisdom or prescribe to his will? Shall God receive instruction from every peevish complainer_ and change the measures he has taken to please him?__ It is a question with disdain. Shall any teach God knowledge? ch. xxi,20250223
God puts contempt upon sinners_ but shows respect to saints_ v,20250223
God says (Isa. xlv.19)_ I have not spoken in secret. There is no speech or language where Wisdom's voice is not heard. Truth seeks not corners_ nor is virtue ashamed of itself,20250223
God says Amen to his distrust and despair. Sixthly_ He is in care to secure his partners_ and hopes to secure himself by his partnership with them; but that is in vain too_ v. 34_ 35. The congregation of them_ the whole confederacy_ they and all their tabernacles_ shall be desolate and consumed with fire. Hypocrisy and bribery are here charged upon them; that is_ deceitful dealing both with God and man—God affronted under colour of religion_ man wronged under colour of justice. It is impossible that these should end well. Though hand join in hand for the support of these perfidious practices_ yet shall not the wicked go unpunished. ,20250223
God sees this concerning vain man that he would be wise_ would be thought so_ though he is born like a wild ass's colt_ so sottish and foolish_ unteachable and untameable. See what man is. 1. He is a vain creature—empty; so the word is. God made him full_ but he emptied himself_ impoverished himself_ and now he is raca_ a creature that has nothing in him,20250223
God sets himself at a distance from those that set him at defiance: The wicked say to the Almighty_ Depart from us_ and he is_ accordingly_ far from them; he does not manifest himself to them_ has no communion with them_ will not hear them_ will not help them_ no_ not in the time of their need. They shall be for ever banished from his presence and he will behold them afar off. Depart from me_ you cursed,20250223
God shall be our life and the length of our days_ and that will be indeed long life_ with an addition. But_ because length of days may possibly become a burden and a trouble_ it is promised_ ,20250223
God shall take away his soul_ sorely against his will. Luke xii. 20_ Thy soul shall be required of thee. God_ as the Judge_ takes it away to be tried and determined to its everlasting state. He shall then fall into the hands of the living God_ to be dealt with immediately.,20250223
God so hates wicked people_ whose hearts are malicious and their lives mischievous_ that even their sacrifices are an abomination to him. God has sacrifices brought him even by wicked men_ to stop the mouth of conscience and to keep up their reputation in the world_ as malefactors come to a sanctuary_ not because it is a holy place_ but because it shelters them from justice; but their sacrifices_ though ever so costly_ are not accepted of God_ because not offered in sincerity nor from a good principle; they dissemble with God_ and in their conversations give the lie to their devotions_ and for that reason they are an abomination to him_ because they are made a cloak for sin_ ch. vii,20250223
God sometimes writes very bitter things against the best and dearest of his saints and servants_ both in outward afflictions and inward disquiet; trouble in body and trouble in mind_ that he may humble them_ and prove them_ and do them good in their latter end. ,20250223
God speaks to the children of men by all the kinds of wisdom_ and_ as in every will_ so in every word_ of God there is a counsel. 1. Human understanding is wisdom_ the light and law of nature_ the powers and faculties of reason_ and the office of conscience_ Job xxxviii,20250223
God takes no pleasure in the legs of a man (Ps. cxlvii. for their strength will soon fail; but in the Lord Jehovah there is everlasting strength; he has everlasting arms. Fifthly_ Then the grinders cease because they are few; the teeth_ with which we grind our meat and prepare it for concoction_ cease to do their part_ because they are few. They are rotted and broken_ and perhaps have been drawn because they ached. Some old people have lost all their teeth_ and others have but few left; and this infirmity is the more considerable because the meat_ not being well chewed_ for want of teeth_ is not well digested_ which has as much influence as any thing upon the other decays of age. Sixthly_ Those that look out of the windows are darkened; the eyes wax dim_ as Isaac's (Gen. xxvii. 1)_ and Ahijah's_ 1 Kings xiv,20250223
God tells them plainly that they had not spoken of him the thing that was right_ like Job_ that is_ they had censured and condemned Job upon a false hypothesis_ had represented God fighting against Job as an enemy when really he was only trying him as a friend_ and this was not right. Those do not say well of God who represent his fatherly chastisements of his own children as judicial punishments and who cut them off from his favour upon the account of them. Note_ It is a dangerous thing to judge uncharitably of the spiritual and eternal state of others_ for in so doing we may perhaps condemn those whom God has accepted_ which is a great provocation to him; it is offending his little ones_ and he takes himself to be wronged in all the wrongs that are done to them. ,20250223
God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he_ which we cannot comprehend.,20250223
God thus bespeaks our attention to his word: Hear_ O my son! and receive my sayings. Secondly_ He must hold fast the form of sound words which his father gave him (v. 4): Let thy heart retain my words; and except the word be hid in the heart_ lodged in the will and affections_ it will not be retained. Thirdly_ He must govern himself by them: Keep my commandments_ obey them_ and that is the way to increase in the knowledge of them_ John vii,20250223
God tries the heart by affliction (Ps. lxvi. 10_ and often chooses his people in that furnace (Isa. xlviii. 10) and makes them choice,20250223
God waters the earth with that with which he once drowned it_ only dispensing it in another manner_ to let us know how much we lie at his mercy_ and how kind he is_ in giving rain by drops_ that the benefit of it may be the further and the more equally diffused_ as by an artificial water-pot. ,20250223
God will have us to live by faith_ not by sense; for this is agreeable to a state of probation. It were not a fair trial if the face of God's throne were visible now as it will be in the great day.,20250223
God will provide a settlement for his people_ mean perhaps and movable_ a cottage_ a tabernacle_ but a fixed and quiet habitation. __Thou shalt not sin___ or wander; that is_ as some understand it_ __thou shalt not be a fugitive and a vagabond__ (Cain's curse)_ __but shalt dwell in the land_ and verily_ not uncertainly as vagrants_ shalt thou be fed.__ ,20250223
God will rather leave many wicked people to be cut off than abandon his own people. I will give men for thee_ Isa. xliii. 3_ 4.,20250223
God will resent it as a heinous affront: __He will reprove thee_ will reckon with thee as a traitor against his crown and dignity_ and lay thee under the heavy doom of those that add to his words_ or diminish from them___ Deut. iv. 2; xii,20250223
God will thus contend with him_ and begs for the pardon of his sins and a speedy release out of his miseries_ ver. 17-21. It is hard to methodize the speeches of one who owned himself almost desperate_ ch. vi. 26.,20250223
God would not suffer the sin of the deceiver_ nor the misery of the deceived_ if he knew not how to set bounds to both and bring glory to himself out of both. Hallelujah_ the Lord God omnipotent thus reigns; and it is well he does_ for otherwise there is so little wisdom and so little honesty in the world that it would all have been in confusion and ruin long ago.,20250223
God would restore him to his former prosperity and safety (ver. 15-19); but that_ if he were wicked it was in vain to expect it_ ver. 20.,20250223
God would soon turn his captivity_ ver. 5-7.,20250223

God's great quarrel with wicked people is for their not fearing before him; that is at the bottom of their wickedness_ and cuts them off from all happiness.,20250223
God's incontestable justice_ ver. 10-12_ 17_ 19_ 23,20250223
God's omniscience. It is a great truth that God's eyes are upon all the ways of men (Prov. v. 20_ 21); but Job here mentions it with application to himself and his own actions: Doth not he see my ways? O God! thou hast searched me and known me. God sees what rule we walk by_ what company w walk with_ what end we walk towards_ and therefore what ways we walk in. ,20250223
God's people are certainly a happy people_ though they be oppressed: __It shall be well with those that fear God_ I say with all those_ and those only_ who fear before him.__ Note_ ,20250223
God's sovereign dominion over man_ ver. 12_ 13,20250223
God's sufficiency for the saints: His name is a strong tower for them_ in which they may take rest when they are weary and take sanctuary when they are pursued_ where they may be lifted up above their enemies and fortified against them. There is enough in God_ and in the discoveries which he has made of himself to us_ to make us easy at all times. The wealth laid up in this tower is enough to enrich them_ to be a continual feast and a continuing treasure to them. The strength of this tower is enough to protect them; the name of the Lord is all that whereby he has made himself known as God_ and our God_ not only his titles and attributes_ but his covenant and all the promises of it; these make up a tower_ a strong tower_ impenetrable_ impregnable_ for all God's people,20250223
God_ by his ordinance_ as by a hedge_ has inclosed the prerogatives and powers of princes; their persons are under his special protection; those therefore that form any treasonable designs against their peace_ their crown_ and dignity_ are but twisting halters for themselves. ,20250223
God_ for holy ends_ permits it_ ver. 6.,20250223
God_ for the further proving of his own power and disproving of Job's pretensions_ concludes his discourse with the description of two vast and mighty animals_ far exceeding man in bulk and strength_ one he calls behemoth_ the other leviathan. In these verses we have the former described. __Behold now behemoth_ and consider whether thou art able to contend with him who made that beast and gave him all the power he has_ and whether it is not thy wisdom rather to submit to him and make thy peace with him.__ Behemoth signifies beasts in general_ but must here be meant of some one particular species. Some understand it of the bull; others of an amphibious animal_ well known (they say) in Egypt_ called the river-horse (hippopotamus)_ living among the fish in the river Nile_ but coming out to feed upon the earth. But I confess I see no reason to depart from the ancient and most generally received opinion_ that it is the elephant that is here described_ which is a very strong stately creature_ of very large stature above any other_ of wonderful sagacity_ and of so great a reputation in the animal kingdom that among so many four-footed beasts as we have had the natural history of (ch. xxxviii. and xxxix.) we can scarcely suppose this should be omitted. Observe_,20250223
God_ having displayed his own power in those creatures that are strong and despise man_ here shows it in one scarcely inferior to any of them in strength_ and yet very tame and serviceable to man_ and that is the horse_ especially the horse that is prepared against the day of battle and is serviceable to man at a time when he has more than ordinary occasion for his service. It seems_ there was_ in Job's country_ a noble generous breed of horses. Job_ it is probable_ kept many_ though they are not mentioned among his possessions_ cattle for use in husbandry being there valued more than those for state and war_ which alone horses were then reserved for_ and they were not then put to such mean services as with us they are commonly put to. Concerning the great horse_ that stately beast_ it is here observed,20250223
God_ having in the foregoing verses shown Job how unable he was to deal with the leviathan_ here sets forth his own power in that massy mighty creature. Here is_,20250223
God_ the book of Psalms how we are to worship him_ pay our homage to him_ and maintain our communion with him_ and then the book of the Proverbs shows very particularly how we are to govern ourselves en pase anastrophe—in every turn of human life; thus shall the man of God_ by a due attention to these lights_ be perfect_ thoroughly furnished for every good work. And these are placed according to their natural order_ as well as according to the order of time; for very fitly are we first led into the knowledge of God_ our judgments rightly formed concerning him_ and our mistakes rectified_ and then instructed how to worship him and to choose the things that please him. We have here much of natural religion_ its principles_ its precepts—much of God_ his infinite perfections_ his relations to man_ and his government both of the world and of the church; here is much of Christ_ who is the spring_ and soul_ and centre_ of revealed religion_ and whom both Job and David were eminent types of_ and had clear and happy prospects of. We have here that which will be of use to enlighten our understandings_ and to acquaint us more and more with the things of God_ with the deep things of God—speculations to entertain the most contemplative_ and discoveries to satisfy the most inquisitive and increase the knowledge of those that are most knowing. Here is that also which_ with a divine light_ will bring into the soul the heat and influence of a divine fire_ will kindle and inflame pious and devout affections_ on which wings we may soar upwards until we enter into the holiest. We may here be in the mount with God_ to behold his beauty; and when we come down from that mount_ if we retain (as we ought) the impressions of our devotion upon our spirits and make conscience of doing that good which the Lord our God here requires of us_ our faces shall shine before all with whom we converse_ who shall take occasion thence to glorify our Father who is in heaven_ Matt. v,20250223
God_ we must even do as St. Paul does (Rom. xi. 33); despairing to find the bottom_ we must sit down at the brink_ and adore the depth: O the depth of the wisdom and knowledge of God! It is but a little portion that we hear and know of God in our present state. He is infinite and incomprehensible; our understandings and capacities are weak and shallow_ and the full discoveries of the divine glory are reserved for the future state. Even the thunder of his power (that is_ his powerful thunder)_ one of the lowest of his ways here in our own region_ we cannot understand. See ch. xxxvii. 4_ 5. Much less can we understand the utmost force and extent of his power_ the terrible efforts and operations of it_ and particularly the power of his anger_ Ps. xc,20250223
God. __Humble thyself to him; make sure of Christ thy friend_ to intercede for thee; pray earnestly that thy sins may be pardoned_ and thou mayest be delivered from going down to the pit_ and it shall not be in vain. Give not sleep to thy eyes nor slumber to thy eye lids_ till this be done.__,20250223
God. We go out of the world naked; the body does_ though the sanctified soul goes clothed_ 2 Cor.,20250223
Godliness is profitable to all things_ 1 Tim. iv,20250223
Good cause given for this caution: Lest thou learn his way. Those we go with we are apt to grow like. Our corrupt hearts have so much tinder in them that it is dangerous conversing with those that throw about the sparks of their passion. We shall thereby get a snare to our souls_ for a disposition to anger is a great snare to any man_ and an occasion of much sin. He does not say_ __Lest thou have ill language given thee or get a broken head___ but_ which is must worse_ __Lest thou imitate him_ to humour him_ and so contract an ill habit.__,20250223
Good men love their worst enemies: The just_ whom the bloody men hate_ seek their soul_ pray for their conversion_ and would gladly do any thing for their salvation. This Christ taught us. Father_ forgive them. The just seek his soul_ that is_ the soul of the upright_ whom the bloody hate (so it is commonly understood)_ seek to protect it from violence_ and save it from_ or avenge it at_ the hands of the blood-thirsty.,20250223
Good men speak help to their neighbours: The mouth of the upright is ready to be opened in the cause of those that are oppressed (ch. xxxi. to plead for them_ to witness for them_ and so to deliver them_ particularly those whom the wicked lie in wait for. A man may sometimes do a very good work with one good word.,20250223
Good people are called saints even in the Old Testament; and therefore I know not why we should_ in common speaking (unless because we must loqui cum vulgo—speak as our neighbours)_ appropriate the title to those of the New Testament_ and not say St. Abraham_ St. Moses_ and St. Isaiah_ as well as St. Matthew and St. Mark; and St. David the psalmist_ as well as St. David the British bishop. Aaron is expressly called the saint of the Lord. ,20250223
Good people are taken under God's special protection_ and therein they may have an entire satisfaction. They are safe and may be easy_ ,20250223
Grace and sin in their true colours. Grace reigning is a reverence of God_ and gives honour to him who is infinitely great and high_ and to whom all honour is due_ than which what is more becoming or should be more pleasing to the rational creature? Sin reigning is no less than a contempt of God. In this_ more than in any thing_ sin appears exceedingly sinful_ that it despises God_ whom angels adore. Those that despise God's precepts_ and will not be ruled by them_ his promises_ and will not accept of them_ despise God himself and all his attributes,20250223
Grace and sin in their true light. By this we may know a man that has grace_ and the fear of God_ reigning in him_ he walks in his uprightness_ he makes conscience of his actions_ is faithful both to God and man_ and every stop he makes_ as well as every step he takes_ is by rule; here is one that honours God. But_ on the contrary_ he that is perverse in his ways_ that wilfully follows his own appetites and passions_ that is unjust and dishonest and contradicts his profession in his conversation_ however he may pretend to devotion_ he is a wicked man_ and will be reckoned with as a despiser of God himself.,20250223
Grace remaining_ notwithstanding_ in the habit of it: __My heart wakes; my own conscience reproaches me for it_ and ceases not to rouse me out of my sluggishness. The spirit is willing_ and_ after the inner man_ I delight in the law of God_ and with my mind I serve that. I am_ for the present_ overpowered by temptation_ but all does not go one way in me. I sleep_ but it is not a dead sleep; I strive against it; it is not a sound sleep; I cannot be easy under this indisposition.__ Note_ ,20250223
Grace to persevere to the end. If we depend upon God_ and seek to him for wisdom_ he will uphold us in our integrity_ will enable us to keep the paths of judgment_ however we may be tempted to turn aside out of them; for he preserves the way of his saints_ that it be not perverted_ and so preserves them in it safe and blameless to his heavenly kingdom. The assurances God has given us of his grace_ if duly improved_ will excite and quicken our endeavours in doing our duty. Work out your salvation_ for God works in you.,20250223
Graces in the soul are as spices in these gardens_ that in them which is valuable and useful. ,20250223
Grant me some respite_ some breathing-time_ some little enjoyment of myself.__ This he would reckon a great favour. Those that are not duly thankful for constant ease should think how welcome one hour's ease would be if they were in constant pain. Two things he pleads:—,20250223
Grateful Enjoyment.,20250223
Great care must be taken to prevent quarrels among relations_ and those that are under special obligation to each other_ not only because they are most unnatural and unbecoming_ but because between such things are commonly taken most unkindly_ and resentments are apt to be carried too far. Wisdom and grace would indeed make it most easy to us to forgive our relations and friends if they offend us_ but corruption makes it most difficult to forgive them; let us therefore take heed of disobliging a brother_ or one that has been as a brother; ingratitude is very provoking.,20250223
Great men had their hands adorned with gold rings on their fingers_ set with diamonds or other precious stones_ but_ in her eye_ his hands themselves were as gold rings; all the instances of his power_ the works of his hands_ all the performances of his providence and grace_ are all rich_ and pure_ and precious_ as gold_ as the precious onyx and the sapphire_ all fitted to the purpose for which they were designed as gold rings to the finger_ and all beautiful and very becoming_ as rings set with beryl. His hands_ which are stretched forth both to receive his people and to give to them_ are thus rich and comely. ,20250223
Great men have commonly those about them that stir them up to revenge. David had so_ 1 Sam. xxiv. 4; xxvi. 8,20250223
Great wet is sometimes a great judgment. He raises the waters_ and overturns the earth_ the productions of it_ the buildings upon it. A sweeping rain is said to leave no food_ Prov. xxviii,20250223
Grievances of Job. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Grievous_ very grievous_ marvellous_ exceedingly marvellous. God hunted him as a lion_ as a fierce lion hunts and runs down his prey. God was not only strange to him_ but showed himself marvellous upon him_ by bringing him into uncommon troubles and so making him prodigy_ a wonder unto many. All wondered that God would inflict and that Job could bear so much. That which made his afflictions most grievous was that he felt God's indignation in them; it was this that made them taste so bitter and lie so heavy. They were God's witnesses against him_ tokens of his displeasure; this made the sores of his body wounds in his spirit. ,20250223
Hab. ii. 13; Isa. lv,20250223
Had Eliphaz felt but the one-half of Job's affliction_ he would have said_ __It smites me_ it wounds me;__ but_ speaking of Job's afflictions_ he makes a mere trifle of it: __It touches thee and thou canst not bear to be touched.__,20250223
Harmless mirth is recommended to us_ as that which contributes to the health of the body_ making men lively and fit for business_ and to the acceptableness of the conversation_ making the face to shine and rendering us pleasant one to another. A cheerful spirit_ under the government of wisdom and grace_ is a great ornament to religion_ puts a further lustre upon the beauty of holiness_ and makes men the more capable of doing good,20250223
Hatred and Strife.,20250223
Haughtiness and severity towards his servants_ ver. 13-15,20250223
Have I been so long time with you_ and yet hast thou not known me_ Philip? But_ 3. With what tenderness he acquaints her where she might find him. If men say_ Lo_ here is Christ_ or_ Lo_ he is there_ believe them not_ go not after them_ Matt.,20250223
Have we vowed to give our own selves unto the Lord? Let us then be as good as our word_ act in his service_ to his glory_ and not sacrilegiously alienate ourselves. ,20250223
Having business to go abroad_ to look after their grounds_ she desires the company of her beloved. Note_ Wherever we are_ we may keep up our communion with God_ if it be not our own fault_ for he is always at our right hand_ his eye always upon us_ and both his word and his ear always nigh us. By going about our worldly affairs with heavenly holy hearts_ mixing pious thoughts with common actions_ and having our eyes ever towards the Lord_ we may take Christ along with us whithersoever we go. Nor should we go any whither where we cannot in faith ask him to go along with us,20250223
Having described the firm and faithful defence of the righteous man (v.,20250223
Having laid down these principles_ he acknowledges that all things come alike to all; so it has been formerly_ and therefore we are not to think it strange if it be so now_ if it be so with us and our families. Some make this_ and all that follows to v. 13_ to be the perverse reasoning of the atheists against the doctrine of God's providence; but I rather take it to be Solomon's concession_ which he might the more freely make when he had fixed those truths which are sufficient to guard against any ill use that may be made of what he grants. Observe here (v. 2)_,20250223
Having no owner_ he has no feeder_ nor is any provision made for him_ but he must shift for himself: The range of the mountains is his pasture_ and a bare pasture it is; there he searches after here and there a green thing_ as he can find it and pick it up; whereas the labouring asses have green things in plenty_ without their searching for them. From the untameableness of this and other creatures we may infer how unfit we are to give law to Providence_ who cannot give law even to a wild ass's colt.,20250223
Having received fresh tokens of his love_ and full assurances of her interest in him_ she presses forward towards further acquaintance with him; as blessed Paul_ who desired yet more and more of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus_ Phil. iii,20250223
Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work_ here we find him in love with his ease; he lies in his bed on one side till he is weary of that_ and then turns to the other_ but still in his bed_ when it is far in the day and work is to be done_ as the door is moved_ but not removed; and so his business is neglected and his opportunities are let slip. See the sluggard's character. 1. He is one that does not care to get out of his bed_ but seems to be hung upon it_ as the door upon the hinges. Bodily ease_ too much consulted_ is the sad occasion of many a spiritual disease. Those that love sleep will prove in the end to have loved death,20250223
He (that is_ man) as a rotten thing_ the principle of whose putrefaction is in itself_ consumes_ even like a moth-eaten garment_ which becomes continually worse and worse. Or_ He (that is_ God) like rottenness_ and like a moth_ consumes me. Compare this with Hos. v. 12_ I will be unto Ephraim as a moth_ and to the house of Judah as rottenness; and see Ps. xxxix,20250223
He acknowledged the hand of God both in the mercies he had formerly enjoyed and in the afflictions he was now exercised with: The Lord gave_ and the Lord has taken away. We must own the divine Providence_ ,20250223
He acknowledges_ with adoration_ the discoveries that were made of God. These things which he himself had said_ and which Bildad had said_ are his ways_ and this is heard of him; this is something of God. But_ 2. He admires the depth of that which is undiscovered. This that we have said is but part of his ways_ a small part. What we know of God is nothing in comparison with what is in God and what God is. After all the discoveries which God has made to us_ and all the enquiries we have made after God_ still we are much in the dark concerning him_ and must conclude_ Lo_ these are but parts of his ways. Something we hear of him by his works and by his word; but_ alas! how little a portion is heard of him? heard by us_ heard from us! We know but in part; we prophesy but in part. When we have said all we can_ concerning,20250223
He acts invisibly and undiscerned_ v,20250223
He acts with an incontestable sovereignty_ v,20250223
He acts with an irresistible power_ which no creature can resist_ v,20250223
He adds a terrible threatening to disobedient children (v. for warning to the first of those four wicked generations_ that curse their parents (v. and shows here_,20250223
He admires the beauty and ornaments of her countenance (v. 10): Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels_ the attire of the head_ curls of hair_ or favourites (so some)_ or knots of ribbons; thy neck also with chains_ such as persons of the first rank wear_ chains of gold. The ordinances of Christ are the ornaments of the church. The graces_ gifts_ and comforts of the Spirit_ are the adorning of every believing soul_ and beautify it; these render it_ in the sight of God_ of great price. The ornaments of the saints are many_ but all orderly disposed in rows and chains_ in which there is a mutual connexion with and dependence upon each other. The beauty is not from any thing in themselves_ from the neck or from the cheeks_ but from ornaments with which they are set off. It was comeliness which I put upon thee_ said the Lord God; for we were born not only naked_ but polluted_ Ezek. xvi. 14.,20250223
He adored God in both. When all was gone he fell down and worshipped. Note_ Afflictions must not divert us from_ but quicken us to_ the exercises of religion. Weeping must not hinder sowing_ nor hinder worshipping. He eyed not only the hand of God_ but the name of God_ in his afflictions_ and gave glory to that: Blessed be the name of the Lord. He has still the same great and good thoughts of God that ever he had_ and is as forward as ever to speak them forth to his praise; he can find in his heart to bless God even when he takes away as well as when he gives. Thus must we sing both of mercy and judgment_ Ps. ci. 1. ,20250223
He adores God even in taking away_ and gives him honour by a willing submission; nay_ he gives him thanks for good designed him by his afflictions_ for gracious supports under his afflictions_ and the believing hopes he had of a happy issue at last.,20250223
He appeals even to the inferior creatures for the proof of this—the beasts_ and fowls_ and trees_ and even the earth itself; consult these_ and they shall tell thee_ v. 7_ 8. Many a good lesson we may learn from them_ but what are they here to teach us?,20250223
He appeals from the censures of his friends to the just judgment of God; and this he thought was an evidence for him that he was not a hypocrite_ for then he durst not have made such an appeal as this. St Paul comforted himself in this_ that he that judged him was the Lord_ and therefore he valued not man's judgment (1 Cor. iv. 3_ but he was willing to wait till the appointed day of decision came; whereas Job is impatient_ and passionately wishes to have the judgment-day anticipated_ and to have his cause tried quickly_ as it were_ by a special commission. The apostle found it necessary to press it much upon suffering Christians patiently to expect the Judge's coming_ Jam. v. 7-9.,20250223
He appeals to God for his conviction_ and begs that God would take him to task (ver.,20250223
He appeals to God_ and wishes him to appear against Job. So very confident is he that Job is in the wrong that nothing will serve him but that God must immediately appear to silence and condemn him. We are commonly ready with too much assurance to interest God in our quarrels_ and to conclude that_ if he would but speak_ he would take our part and speak for us_ as Zophar here: O that God would speak! for he would certainly open his lips against thee; whereas_ when God did speak_ he opened his lips for Job against his three friends. We ought indeed to leave all controversies to be determined by the judgment of God_ which we are sure is according to truth; but those are not always in the right who are most forward to appeal to that judgment and prejudge it against their antagonists. Zophar despairs to convince Job himself_ and therefore desires God would convince him of two things which it is good for every one of us duly to consider_ and under all our afflictions cheerfully to confess:—,20250223
He appeals to all intelligent indifferent persons whether there was not a great deal of sin and folly in that which Job said. 1. He would have the matter thoroughly examined_ and brought to an issue (v. 36): __My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end. If any will undertake to justify what he has said_ let them do it; if not_ let us all agree to bear our testimony against it.__ Many understand it of his trial by afflictions: __Let his troubles be continued till he be thoroughly humbled_ and his proud spirit brought down_ till he be made to see his error and to retract what he has so presumptuously said against God and his providence. Let the trial be continued till the end be obtained.__ 2. He appeals both to God and man_ and desires the judgment of both upon it. ,20250223
He appeals to the by-standers (v. 34): __Let men of understanding tell me whether they can put any more favourable construction upon Job's words than I have put_ and whether he has not spoken very ill and ought not to cry_ Peccavi—I have done wrong.__ In what Job had said he thought it appeared_,20250223
He appeals to their judgment_ and therefore submits to their trial_ v,20250223
He applied himself to the improvement of these advantages_ and the opportunities he had of getting wisdom_ which_ though ever so great_ will not make a man wise unless he give his mind to it. Solomon gave his heart to seek and search out all things to be known by wisdom_ v,20250223
He applied his studies especially to that part of learning which is most serviceable to the conduct of human life_ and consequently is the most valuable (v. 17): __I gave my heart to know the rules and dictates of wisdom_ and how I might obtain it; and to know madness and folly_ how I might prevent and cure it_ to know the snares and insinuations of it_ that I might avoid them_ and guard against them_ and discover its fallacies.__ So industrious was Solomon to improve himself in knowledge that he gained instruction both by the wisdom of prudent men and by the madness of foolish men_ by the field of the slothful_ as well as of the diligent.,20250223
He applies himself to the young_ and writes to them as children_ to awaken them to think of death (v. 9_ 10); here we have_,20250223
He applies it to Job_ and challenges him to solve the phenomena of these works of nature_ that confessing his ignorance in them_ he might own himself an incompetent judge in the proceedings of divine Providence_ ver. 14-22. And then_,20250223
He appoints him to be the priest of this congregation_ and promises to accept him and his mediation for his friends. __Take your sacrifices to my servant Job_ for him will I accept.__ Those whom God washes from their sins he makes to himself kings and priests. True penitents shall not only find favour as petitioners for themselves_ but be accepted as intercessors for others also. It was a great honour that God hereby put upon Job_ in appointing him to offer sacrifice for his friends_ as formerly he used to do for his own children_ ch. i,20250223
He approves of it: __He knows that_ however I may sometimes have taken a false step_ yet I have still taken a good way_ have chosen the way of truth_ and therefore he knows it___ that is_ he accepts it_ and is well pleased with it_ as he is said to know the way of the righteous_ Ps. i,20250223
He argues against it. Let us not fret at the power and success of oppressors_ nor be envious at them_ for,20250223
He arms us against it with some necessary directions. If we would not be driven mad by oppression_ but preserve the possession of our own souls_,20250223
He asks this,20250223
He asks_ Who hath woe? Who hath sorrow? Who has not_ in this world? Many have woe and sorrow_ and cannot help it; but drunkards wilfully create woe and sorrow to themselves. Those that have contentions have woe and sorrow; and drunkards are the fools whose lips enter into contention. When the wine is in the wit is out and the passions are up; and thence come drunken scuffles_ and drunken frays_ and drunken disputes over the cups; many a vexatious ruining law-suit has begun thus. There is babbling_ quarrels in word and the exchanging of scurrilous language; yet it rests not there: you shall have wounds without cause_ for causes are things which drunkards are in no capacity to judge of_ and therefore they deal blows about without the least consideration why or wherefore_ and must expect to be in like manner treated themselves. The wounds which men receive in defence of their country and its just rights are their honour; but wounds without cause_ received in the service of their lusts_ are marks of their infamy. Nay_ drunkards wound themselves in a tender part_ for they have redness of eyes_ symptoms of an inward inflammation; their sight is weakened by it_ and their looks are deformed. This comes_ ,20250223
He asserts the misery_ not only of those who are openly wicked and profane_ but of hypocrites_ who secretly practice wickedness under a show and profession of religion_ because such a wicked man he looked upon Job to be; and it is true that a form of godliness_ if it be made use of for a cloak of maliciousness_ does but make bad worse. Dissembled piety is double iniquity_ and the ruin that attends it will be accordingly. The hottest place in hell will be the portion of hypocrites_ as our Saviour intimates_ Matt. xxiv,20250223
He assures him of comfort if he took this counsel_ v. 15_ &c. If he would repent and reform_ he should_ without doubt_ be easy and happy_ and all would be well. Perhaps Zophar might insinuate that_ unless God did speedily make such a change as this in his condition_ he and his friends would be confirmed in their opinion of him as a hypocrite and a dissembler with God. A great truth_ however_ is conveyed_ That_ the work of righteousness will be peace_ and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever_ Isa. xxxii,20250223
He assures him that_ upon his repentance and reformation (ver. 13_,20250223
He assures them he was angry with them: My wrath is kindled against thee and thy two friends. God is very angry with those who despise and reproach their brethren_ who triumph over them_ and judge hardly of them_ either for their calamities or for their infirmities. Though they were wise and good men_ yet_ when they spoke amiss_ God was angry with them and let them know that he was. ,20250223
He begins with a solemn protestation of his integrity and of his resolution to hold it fast_ ver. 2-6.,20250223
He begins with an awakening challenge and demand in general_ ver. 2_ 3.,20250223
He believed that_ when his adversaries came to consider the matter so closely as they must do if they put the charge in writing_ the accusations would be trivial and minute_ and every one that saw them would say_ __If this was all they had to say against him_ it was a shame they gave him so much trouble.__,20250223
He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness. He frightened himself with the perpetuity of his calamity_ and God also shall choose his delusions and bring his fears upon him (Isa. lxvi. as he did upon Israel_ Num. xiv,20250223
He bespeaks Job's acceptance of what he had offered and begs of him to mark it well_ v,20250223
He bespeaks Job's favourable acceptance of what he should say_ and desires he would take him for that person whom he had so often wished for_ that would plead with him_ and receive his plea on God's behalf_ ver. 1-7.,20250223
He bespeaks a patient hearing_ ver. 2.,20250223
He bespeaks not only the audience_ but the assistance of the company_ ver. 2-4.,20250223
He bespeaks the charitable and compassionate sympathy of his friends with him_ and hopes_ by representing the greatness of his calamity_ to bring them to a better temper towards him. To those that are pained it is some ease to be pitied.,20250223
He bids defiance to God_ and to his authority and power_ v,20250223
He bitterly complains of God's withdrawings from him (v. 24): Wherefore hidest thou thy face? This must be meant of something more than his outward afflictions; for the loss of estate_ children_ health_ might well consist with God's love; when that was all_ he blessed the name of the Lord; but his soul was also sorely vexed_ and that is it which he here laments. 1. That the favours of the Almighty were suspended. God hid his face as one strange to him_ displeased with him_ shy and regardless of him,20250223
He blesses God for what was given_ though now it was taken away. When our comforts are removed from us we must thank God that ever we had them and had them so much longer than we deserved. Nay_ ,20250223
He bravely resists and overcomes the temptation_ v,20250223
He briefly sums up what he had said_ showing that God's great and gracious design_ in all the dispensations of his providence towards the children of men_ is to save them from being for ever miserable and bring them to be for ever happy_ v. 29_ 30. All these things God is working with the children of men. He deals with them by conscience_ by providences_ by ministers_ by mercies_ by afflictions. He makes them sick_ and makes them well again. All these are his operations; he has set the one over the other (Eccl. vii. but his hand is in all; it is he that performs all the things for us. All providences are to be looked upon as God's workings with man_ his strivings with him. He uses a variety of methods to do men good; if one affliction do not do the work_ he will try another; if neither do_ he will try a mercy; and he will send a messenger to interpret both. He often works such things as these twice_ thrice; so it is in the original_ referring to v,20250223
He called their name Adam; and all theirs have the same character_ red earth. Though a man could make himself master of all the treasures of kings and provinces_ yet he is a man still_ mean_ mutable_ and mortal_ and may at any time be involved in the calamities that are common to men. It is good for rich and great men to know and consider that they are but men_ Ps. ix,20250223
He can and will at last do it effectually (v. not only bring them to the dust_ from which they might hope to arise_ but hide them in the dust_ like the proud Egyptian whom Moses slew and hid in the sand (Exod. ii. that is_ they shall be brought not only to death_ but to the grave_ that pit out of which there is no return. They were proud of the figure they made_ but they shall be buried in oblivion and be no more remembered than those that are hidden in the dust_ out of sight and out of mind. They were linked in leagues and confederacies to do mischief_ and are now bound in bundles. They are hidden together; not their rest_ but their shame together is in the dust_ ch. xvii,20250223
He cannot but own that those who had the charge of him_ parents_ ministers_ had done their part; they had been his teachers; they had instructed him_ had given him good counsel and fair warning (v. 13); but to his own shame and confusion does he speak it_ and therein justifies God in all the miseries that were brought upon him_ he had not obeyed their voice_ for indeed he never inclined his ear to those that instructed him_ never minded what they said nor admitted the impressions of it. Note_ Those who have had a good education and do not live up to it will have a great deal to answer for another day; and those who will not now remember what they were taught_ to conform themselves to it_ will be made to remember it as an aggravation of their sin_ and consequently of their ruin. Secondly_ That by the frequent acts of sin the habits of it were so rooted and confirmed that his heart was fully set in him to commit it (v.,20250223
He cannot command one shower of rain for the relief of himself or his friends: __Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds_ those bottles of heaven_ that abundance of waters may cover thee_ to water thy fields when they are dry and parched?__ If we lift up our voice to God_ to pray for rain_ we may have it (Zech. x. 1); but if we lift up our voice to the clouds_ to demand it_ they will soon tell us they are not at our beck_ and we shall go without it_ Jer. xiv,20250223
He cannot commission one flash of lightning_ if he had a mind to make use of it for the terror of his enemies (v. 35): __Canst thou send lightnings_ that they may go on thy errand_ and do the execution thou desirest? Will they come at thy call_ and say unto thee_ Here we are?__ No_ the ministers of God's wrath will not be ministers of ours. Why should they_ since the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God? See Luke ix. 55.,20250223
He cannot endure the advice and admonitions of his friends: He will not go unto the wise_ lest they should give him wise counsel. We ought not only to bid the wise welcome when they come to us_ but to go to them_ as beggars to the rich man's door for an alms; but this the scorner will not do_ for fear of being told of his faults and prevailed upon to reform.,20250223
He cannot endure the checks of his own conscience_ nor will he suffer it to deal plainly with him: He loves not to reprove him (so some read it); he cannot endure to retire into his own heart and commune seriously with that_ will not admit of any free thought or fair reasoning with himself_ nor let his own heart smite him_ if he can help it. That man's case is sad who is afraid of being acquainted and of arguing with himself,20250223
He cannot say that,20250223
He caused his heart to despair of all his labour (v. 20); he took pains to possess himself with a deep sense of the vanity of worldly business_ that it would not bring in the advantage and satisfaction he had formerly flattered himself with the hopes of. Our hearts are very loth to quit their expectations of great things from the creature; we must go about_ must fetch a compass_ in arguing with them_ to convince them that there is not that in the things of this world which we are apt to promise ourselves from them. Have we so often bored and sunk into this earth for some rich mine of satisfaction_ and found not the least sign or token of it_ but been always frustrated in the search_ and shall we not at length set our hearts at rest and despair of ever finding it? 3. He came to that_ at length_ that he hated life itself (v. because it is subject to so many toils and troubles_ and a constant series of disappointments. God had given Solomon such largeness of heart_ and such vast capacities of mind_ that he experienced more than other men of the unsatisfying nature of all the things of this life and their insufficiency to make him happy. Life itself_ that is so precious to a man_ and such a blessing to a good man_ may become a burden to a man of business.,20250223
He cautions him not to persist in his frowardness. Several good cautions he gives him to this purport.,20250223
He challenges him to give such proofs of his knowledge as would serve to justify his enquiries into the divine counsels (v. 3): __Gird up now thy loins like a stout man; prepare thyself for the encounter; I will demand of thee_ will put some questions to thee_ and answer me if thou canst_ before I answer thine.__ Those that go about to call God to an account must expect to be catechised and called to an account themselves_ that they may be made sensible of their ignorance and arrogance. God here puts Job in mind of what he had said_ ch. xiii,20250223
He charged him with atheism_ infidelity_ and gross impiety_ and thought this was at the bottom of his injustice and oppressiveness: he that did not fear God did not regard man. He would have it thought that Job was an Epicurean_ who did indeed own the being of God_ but denied his providence_ and fancied that he confined himself to the entertainments of the upper world and never concerned himself in the inhabitants and affairs of this.,20250223
He charges Job with saying that which he had not said (v. 4): Thou hast said_ My doctrine is pure. And what if he had said so? It was true that Job was sound in the faith_ and orthodox in his judgment_ and spoke better of God than his friends did. If he had expressed himself unwarily_ yet it did not therefore follow but that his doctrine was true. But he charges him with saying_ I am clean in thy eyes. Job had not said so: he had indeed said_ Thou knowest that I am not wicked (ch. x. 7); but he had also said_ I have sinned_ and never pretended to a spotless perfection. He had indeed maintained that he was not a hypocrite as they charged him; but to infer thence that he would not own himself a sinner was an unfair insinuation. We ought to put the best construction on the words and actions of our brethren that they will bear; but contenders are tempted to put the worst.,20250223
He charges Job with some more indecent expressions that had dropped from him_ ver. 5-9.,20250223
He charges him with hypocrisy in his profession_ grounding his charge upon his present troubles and his conduct under them_ ver. 5_ 6.,20250223
He charges him with impiety and irreligion (v. 4): __Thou castest off fear___ that is_ __the fear of God_ and that regard to him which thou shouldst have; and then thou restrainest prayer.__ See what religion is summed up in_ fearing God and praying to him_ the former the most needful principle_ the latter the most needful practice. Where no fear of God is no good is to be expected; and those who live without prayer certainly live without God in the world. Those who restrain prayer do thereby give evidence that they cast off fear. Surely those have no reverence of God's majesty_ no dread of his wrath_ and are in no care about their souls and eternity_ who make no applications to God for his grace. Those who are prayerless are fearless and graceless. When the fear of God is cast off all sin is let in and a door opened to all manner of profaneness. It is especially bad with those who have had some fear of God_ but have now cast it off—have been frequent in prayer_ but now restrain it. How have they fallen! How is their first love lost! It denotes a kind of force put upon themselves. The fear of God would cleave to them_ but they throw it off; prayer would be uttered_ but they restrain it; and_ in both_ they baffle their convictions. Those who either omit prayer or straiten and abridge themselves in it_ quenching the spirit of adoption and denying themselves the liberty they might take in the duty_ restrain prayer. This is bad enough_ but it is worse to restrain others from prayer_ to prohibit and discourage prayer_ as Darius_ Dan. vi,20250223
He charges him with intolerable arrogancy and self-conceitedness. It was a just_ and reasonable_ and modest demand that Job had made (ch. xii.,20250223
He charges him with many high crimes and misdemeanours_ for which he supposes God was now punishing him. 1. Oppression and injustice_ ver. 5-11,20250223
He charges them with folly_ vanity_ weakness_ infirmity_ and imperfection_ in comparison with himself. If the world were left to the government of the angels_ and they were trusted with the sole management of affairs_ they would take false steps_ and everything would not be done for the best_ as now it is. Angels are intelligences_ but finite ones. Though not chargeable with iniquity_ yet with imprudence. This last clause is variously rendered by the critics. I think it would bear this reading_ repeating the negation_ which is very common: He will put no trust in his saints; nor will he glory in his angels (in angelis suis non ponet gloriationem) or make his boast of them_ as if their praises_ or services_ added any thing to him: it is his glory that he is infinitely happy without them.,20250223
He charges us to behave ourselves well there_ that we may not miss of our end in coming thither. Religious exercises are not vain things_ but_ if we mismanage them_ they become vain to us. And therefore_,20250223
He chose out their way_ sat at the helm_ and steered for them_ all referring themselves to his conduct and submitting themselves to his command. To this perhaps_ in many countries_ monarchy owed its rise: such a man as Job_ that so far excelled all his neighbours in wisdom and integrity_ could not but sit chief_ and the fool will_ of course_ be servant to the wise in heart: and_ if the wisdom did but for a while run in the blood_ the honour and power would certainly attend it and so by degrees become hereditary. Two things recommended Job to the sovereignty:—,20250223
He chose the most profitable way of preaching_ by proverbs or short sentences_ which would be more easily apprehended and remembered than long and laboured periods. ,20250223
He cleared Job's righteousness here_ because he_ like an honest man_ held it fast and would not let it go. We have here_,20250223
He comes cheerfully and with great alacrity; he comes leaping and skipping like a roe and like a young hart,20250223
He comes slighting and surmounting all the difficulties that lay in his way; he comes leaping over the mountains_ skipping over the hills (so some read it)_ making nothing of the discouragements he was to break through; the curse of the law_ the death of the cross_ must be undergone_ all the powers of darkness must be grappled with_ but_ before the resolutions of his love_ these great mountains become plains. Whatever opposition is given at any time to the deliverance of God's church_ Christ will break through it_ will get over it. ,20250223
He comes speedily_ like a roe or a young hart; they thought the time long (every day a year)_ but really he hastened; as now_ so then_ surely he comes quickly; he that shall come will come_ and will not tarry. When he comes for the deliverance of his people he flies upon a cloud_ and never stays beyond his time_ which is the best time. We may apply it to particular believers_ who find that even when Christ has withdrawn sensible comforts_ and seems to forsake_ yet it is but for a small moment_ and he will soon return with everlasting loving-kindness.,20250223
He comes to feed his friends_ and entertain them; there you may not only find him_ but find his table richly furnished_ and a hearty welcome to it. He comes to feed himself_ that is_ to please himself with the products of his own grace in his people; for the Lord takes pleasure in those that fear him. He has many gardens_ many particular churches of different sizes and shapes; but_ while they are his_ he feeds in them all_ manifests himself among them_ and is well pleased with them. ,20250223
He comforts himself with the believing hopes of happiness in the other world_ though he had so little comfort in this_ making a very solemn confession of his faith_ with a desire that it might be recorded as an evidence of his sincerity_ ver. 23-27.,20250223
He comforts himself with the hope that God would deal favourably with him in this matter_,20250223
He comforts himself with the hopes of happiness on the other side death and the grave: After I shall awake (so the margin reads it)_ though this body be destroyed_ yet out of my flesh shall I see God. ,20250223
He compares his case to that of the old world_ ver. 15-20.,20250223
He complained of his pain_ but got no ease—begged to know the cause of his affliction_ but could not discover it—appealed to God's tribunal for the clearing of his innocency_ but could not obtain a hearing_ much less a judgment_ upon his appeal: I cry out of wrong_ but I am not heard. God_ for a time_ may seem to turn away his ear from his people_ to be angry at their prayers and overlook their appeals to him_ and they must be excused if_ in that case_ they complain bitterly. Woe unto us if God be against us!,20250223
He complains again of the severity of God's dealings with him (ver. 14-17)_ and then comforts himself with this_ that death would put an end to his troubles_ ver. 18-22.,20250223
He complains of his calamitous condition_ and especially of God's withdrawings from him_ so that he could not get his appeal heard (ver. 2-5)_ nor discern the meaning of God's dealings with him (ver. 8_ nor gain any hope of relief_ ver. 13_ 14. This made deep impressions of trouble and terror upon him_ ver. 15-17. But_,20250223
He complains of the decay of his body; all the beauty and strength of that were gone. When those about him slighted him_ if he had been in health_ and at ease_ he might have enjoyed himself. But he could take as little pleasure in himself as others took in him (v. 20): My bone cleaves now to my skin_ as formerly it did to my flesh; it was this that filled him with wrinkles (ch. xvi. 8); he was a perfect skeleton_ nothing but skin and bones. Nay_ his skin too was almost gone_ little remained unbroken but the skin of his teeth_ his gums and perhaps his lips; all the rest was fetched off by his sore boils. See what little reason we have to indulge the body_ which_ after all our care_ may be thus consumed by the diseases which it has in itself the seeds of.,20250223
He complains of the extremity of pain and misery he was in (v. 14): Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth? That is,20250223
He complains of the great contempt with which they had treated him. Those that are haughty and think too well of themselves are commonly scornful and ready to trample upon all about them. Job found it so_ at least he thought he did (v. 4): I am as one mocked. I cannot say there was cause for this charge; we will not think Job's friends designed him any abuse_ nor aimed at any thing but to convince him_ and so_ in the right method_ to comfort him; yet he cries out_ I am as one mocked. Note_ We are apt to call reproofs reproaches_ and to think ourselves mocked when we are but advised and admonished; this peevishness is our folly_ and a great wrong to ourselves and to our friends. Yet we cannot but say there was colour for this charge; they came to comfort him_ but they vexed him_ gave him counsels and encouragements_ but with no great opinion that either the one or the other would take effect; and therefore he thought they mocked him_ and this added much to his grief. Nothing is more grievous to those that have fallen from the height of prosperity into the depth of adversity than to be trodden on_ and insulted over_ when they are down; and on this head they are too apt to be suspicious. Observe_,20250223
He complains of the greatness of his troubles_ the confusion he was in_ and the loss he was at what to say or do_ ver. 25-35.,20250223
He complains of the hardships he was under (ver. 1-7)_ and then comforts himself with this_ that he was in the hand of the God that made him_ and pleads that_ ver. 8-13.,20250223
He complains of the trouble and terror of mind he was in as the sorest part of his calamity_,20250223
He complains of the unkindness of his relations and of all his old acquaintance. In this also he owns the hand of God (v. 13): He has put my brethren far from me_ that is_ __He has laid those afflictions upon me which frighten them from me_ and make them stand aloof from my sores.__ As it was their sin God was not the author of it; it is Satan that alienates men's minds from their brethren in affliction. But_ as it was Job's trouble_ God ordered it for the completing of his trial. As we must eye the hand of God in all the injuries we receive from our enemies (__the Lord has bidden Shimei curse David__)_ so also in all the slights and unkindnesses we receive from our friends_ which will help us to bear them the more patiently. Every creature is that to us (kind or unkind_ comfortable or uncomfortable) which God makes it to be. Yet this does not excuse Job's relations and friends from the guilt of horrid ingratitude and injustice to him_ which he had reason to complain of; few could have borne it so well as he did. He takes notice of the unkindness,20250223
He complains of the wasting condition of mankind in general. We live in a dying world. Who knows the power of God's anger_ by which we are consumed and troubled_ and in which all our days are passed away? See Ps. xc. 7-9_ 11. And who can bear up against his rebukes? Ps. xxxix.,20250223
He complains of unkind usage. And very unkindly he takes it. 1. That his comforters added to his affliction_ ver. 2-7,20250223
He complains that he was not upon even terms with God (v. 32): __He is not a man_ as I am. I could venture to dispute with a man like myself (the potsherds may strive with the potsherds of the earth)_ but he is infinitely above me_ and therefore I dare not enter the lists with him; I shall certainly be cast if I contend with him.__ Note_ First_ God is not a man as we are. Of the greatest princes we may say_ __They are men as we are___ but not of the great God. His thoughts and ways are infinitely above ours_ and we must not measure him by ourselves. Man is foolish and weak_ frail and fickle_ but God is not. We are depending dying creatures; he is the independent an immortal Creator. Secondly_ The consideration of this should keep us very humble and very silent before God. Let us not make ourselves equal with God_ but always eye him as infinitely above us. ,20250223
He complains to himself and his friends of his troubles_ and the constant agitation he was in_ ver. 1-6.,20250223
He compliments Job with an acknowledgment of the eminence and usefulness of the profession he had made of religion_ ver. 3_ 4.,20250223
He conceals the glory of the upper world_ the dazzling lustre of which we poor mortals could not bear (v. 9): He holds back the face of his throne_ that light in which he dwells_ and spreads a cloud upon it_ through which he judges_ ch. xxii,20250223
He concludes (v.,20250223
He concludes this discourse of the vanity of the creature with this plain inference from the whole_ That it is folly to think of making up a happiness for ourselves in the things of this world_ ver. 11_ 12. Our satisfaction must be in another life_ not in this.,20250223
He concludes with a caution to his friends not to persist in their hard censures of him_ ver. 28_ 29. If the remonstrance Job here makes of his grievances may serve sometimes to justify our complaints_ yet his cheerful views of the future state_ at the same time_ may shame us Christians_ and may serve to silence our complaints_ or at least to balance them.,20250223
He concludes_ at last_ with an awful et cætera (v. 14): Lo_ these are parts of his ways_ the out-goings of his wisdom and power_ the ways in which he walks and by which he makes himself known to the children of men. Here,20250223
He condemns himself_ as not able to contend with God either in law or battle_ ver. 14-21,20250223
He condemns it as an evil_ a common evil_ vanity_ and a disease_ ver. 1_ 2,20250223
He condemns them for their unjust and uncharitable treatment of him_ v,20250223
He condemns what they had said of him_ and the judgment they had given of his character_ ver. 1-5.,20250223
He conducted himself like a wise and good man under his affliction_ like a perfect and upright man_ and one that feared God and eschewed the evil of sin more than that of outward trouble.,20250223
He consents to what they had said of the wisdom_ power_ and sovereignty of God_ and the dominion of his providence over the children of men and all their affairs; he confirms this_ and enlarges upon it_ ver. 12-25.,20250223
He continues his passionate wish that he might speedily be cut off by the stroke of death_ and so be eased of all his miseries_ ver. 8-13.,20250223
He contradicts and confronts what they had said of the destruction of wicked people in this world_ showing that they often prosper_ ver. 6-11.,20250223
He corroborates his assertion by a vision which he had_ in which he was reminded of the incontestable purity and justice of God_ and the meanness_ weakness_ and sinfulness of man_ ver. 12-21. By all this he aims to bring down Job's spirit and to make him both penitent and patient under his afflictions.,20250223
He could appeal to God's omniscience concerning his integrity_ v,20250223
He could do nothing towards the production of the rain_ or frost_ or lightning (ver. 28-30_ 34_ 35_ 37_ nothing towards the directing of the stars and their influences (ver. 31-33)_ nothing towards the making of his own soul_ ver,20250223
He counted upon no agreeable relations but what he had in the grave (v. 14): I have cried to corruption (that is_ to the grave_ where the body will corrupt)_ Thou art my father (for our bodies were formed out of the earth)_ and to the worms there_ You are my mother and my sister_ to whom I am allied (for man is a worm) and with whom I must be conversant_ for the worms shall cover us_ ch. xxi.,20250223
He counted upon no house but the grave (v. 13): __If I wait_ if there be any place where I shall ever be easy again_ it must be in the grave. I should deceive myself if I should count upon any out-let from my trouble but what death will give me. Nothing is so sure as that.__ Note_ In all our prosperity it is good to keep death in prospect. Whatever we expect_ let us be sure to expect that; for that may prevent other things which we expect_ but nothing will prevent that. But see how he endeavours not only to reconcile himself to the grave_ but to recommend it to himself: __It is my house.__ The grave is a house; to the wicked it is a prison-house (ch. xxiv. 19_,20250223
He counted upon no quiet bed but in the darkness: __There___ says he_ __I have made my bed. It is made_ for it is ready_ and I am just going to it.__ The grave is a bed_ for we shall rest in it in the evening of our day on earth_ and rise from it in the morning of our everlasting day_ Isa. lvii,20250223
He counts upon the corrupting of his body in the grave_ and speaks of it with a holy carelessness and unconcernedness: Though_ after my skin (which is already wasted and gone_ none of it remaining but the skin of my teeth_ v. 20) they destroy (those that are appointed to destroy it_ the grave and the worms in it of which he had spoken_ ch. xvii. 14) this body. The word body is added: __Though they destroy this_ this skeleton_ this shadow (ch. xvii. this that I lay my hand upon___ or (pointing perhaps to his weak and withered limbs) __this that you see_ call it what you will; I expect that shortly it will be a feast for the worms.__ Christ's body saw not corruption_ but ours must. And Job mentions this_ that the glory of the resurrection he believed and hoped for might shine the more brightly. Note_ It is good for us often to think_ not only of the approaching death of our bodies_ but of their destruction and dissolution in the grave; yet let not that discourage our hope of their resurrection_ for the same power that made man's body at first_ out of common dust_ can raise it out of its own dust. This body which we now take such care about_ and make such provision for_ will in a little time be destroyed. Even my reins (says Job) shall be consumed within me (v. 27); the innermost part of the body_ which perhaps putrefies first. ,20250223
He covers the passion that is in his own breast; when his spirit is stirred_ and his heart hot within him_ he keeps his mouth as with a bridle_ and suppresses his resentments_ by smothering and stifling them. Anger is shame_ and_ though a wise man be not perfectly free from it_ yet he is ashamed of it_ rebukes it_ and suffers not the evil spirit to speak. ,20250223
He covers the provocation that is given him_ the indignity that is done him_ winks at it_ covers it as much as may be from himself_ that he may not carry his resentments of it too far. It is a kindness to ourselves_ and contributes to the repose of our own minds_ to extenuate and excuse the injuries and affronts that we receive_ instead of aggravating them and making the worst of them_ as we are apt to do.,20250223
He covets to rest in his grave_ that bed where there are no tossings to and fro_ nor any frightful dreams_ v. 15_ 16. ,20250223
He demands an answer to them_ ver. 1_ 2.,20250223
He denies himself the comfort of what he has: he bereaves his soul of good. If our souls are bereaved of good_ it is we ourselves that do bereave them. Others may bereave us of outward good_ but cannot rob us of our graces and comforts_ our spiritual good things. It is our own fault if we do not enjoy ourselves. Yet many are so set upon the world that_ in pursuit of it_ they bereave their souls of good here and for ever_ make shipwreck of faith and of a good conscience_ bereave themselves not only of the favour of God and eternal life_ but of the pleasures of this world too and this present life. Worldly people_ pretending to be wise for themselves_ are really enemies to themselves,20250223
He deprives himself of the good that he might have had of his worldly possessions_ not only forfeits it_ but robs himself of it and throws it from him: His soul is not filled with good_ v,20250223
He describes his folly in not taking the comfort of it; he has no power to eat of it_ lets strangers devour it_ is never filled with good_ and at last has no burial_ ver. 2_ 3,20250223
He describes the height of the prosperity from which he had fallen. And_,20250223
He desired Zion for a habitation; this is a comfort to believers that_ whosoever slights them_ Christ has a desire towards them_ such a desire as will again bring him from heaven to earth to receive them to himself; for he longs to have them all with him_ John xvii. 24; xiv. 3.,20250223
He desires his friends_ in imagination_ for a little while_ to change conditions with him_ to put their souls in his soul's stead_ to suppose themselves in misery like him and him at ease like them. This was no absurd or foreign supposition_ but what might quickly become true in fact. So strange_ so sudden_ frequently_ are the vicissitudes of human affairs_ and such the turns of the wheel_ that the spokes soon change places. Whatever our brethren's sorrows are_ we ought by sympathy to make them our own_ because we know not how soon they may be so. ,20250223
He destroys the perfect and the wicked_ which has a truth in it (for all things come alike to all)_ but it was ill expressed_ and gave too much occasion for this imputation_ and therefore Job sat down silently under it and attempted not his own vindication_ whence Mr. Caryl well observes that good men sometimes speak worse than they mean_ and that a good man will rather bear more blame than he deserves than to stand to excuse himself when he has deserved any blame.,20250223
He determined to keep up communion with his church. ,20250223
He devoted himself to the administration of justice (v. 14): I put on righteousness and it clothed me_ that is_ he had an habitual disposition to execute justice and put on a fixed resolution to do it. It was the girdle of his lions_ Isa. xi,20250223
He did not allow himself any liberty in the use of the delights of sense till he had tired himself with his severe studies. Till his increase of sorrow_ he never thought of giving himself to wine. When we have spent ourselves in doing good we may then most comfortably refresh ourselves with the gifts of God's bounty. Then the delights of sense are rightly used when they are used as we use cordials_ only when we need them; as Timothy drank wine for his health's sake_ 1 Tim. v,20250223
He did not content himself with a few parables_ or wise sayings_ and repeat them again and again_ but he furnished himself with many proverbs_ a great variety of grave discourses_ that he might have something to say on every occasion. ,20250223
He did not deliver his heads and observations at random_ as they came to mind_ but methodized them_ and set them in order that they might appear in more strength and lustre.,20250223
He did not desire to put them to any expense_ did not urge his friends either,20250223
He did not only give them such observations as were obvious and trite_ but he sought out such as were surprising and uncommon; he dug into the mines of knowledge_ and did not merely pick up what lay on the surface. ,20250223
He did not so much as covet his neighbour's wife; for even his heart was not deceived by a woman. The beauty of another man's wife did not kindle in him any unchaste desires_ nor was he ever moved by the allurements of an adulterous woman_ such as is described_ Prov. vii. 6_ &c. See the original of all the defilements of the life; they come from a deceived heart. Every sin is deceitful_ and none more so than the sin of uncleanness. ,20250223
He did not so much as put a compliment upon these pretended deities_ did not perform the least and lowest act of adoration: His mouth did not kiss his hand_ which_ it is likely_ was a ceremony then commonly used even by some that yet would not be thought idolaters. It is an old-fashioned piece of civil respect among ourselves_ in making a bow_ to kiss the hand_ a form which_ it seems_ was anciently used in giving divine honours to the sun and moon. They could not reach to kiss them_ as the men that sacrificed kissed the calves (Hos. xiii. 2_ 1 Kings xix. 18); but_ to show their good will_ they kissed their hand_ reverencing those as their masters which God has made servants to this lower world_ to hold the candle for us. Job never did it.,20250223
He did not so much as rejoice when any mischief befel them_ v,20250223
He did not so much as wish in his own mind that evil might befel them_ v,20250223
He did not so much value the applauses of those at a distance as the attestations of those that were the witnesses of his conduct_ that constantly attended him_ saw him_ and heard him_ and could speak of their own knowledge_ especially theirs who had themselves been the better for him and could speak by their own experience: such was the blessing of him who was ready to perish (v. 13) and who by Job's means was rescued from perishing. Let great men_ and men of estates_ thus do good_ and they shall have praise of the same; and let those who have good done to them look upon it as a just debt they owe to their protectors and benefactors to bless them and give witness to them_ to use their interest on earth for their honour and in heaven for their comfort_ to praise them and pray for them. Those are ungrateful indeed who grudge these small returns.,20250223
He did not upbraid them with the contempt they had put upon him_ in leaving him out of their council_ nor tell them he was poor and had nothing to lose_ and therefore cared not what became of the city; but he did his best for it_ and was blessed with success. Note_ Private interests and personal resentments must always be sacrificed to public good and forgotten when the common welfare is concerned,20250223
He directs him how to behave himself under his affliction (v. 8): I would seek unto God; surely I would: so it is in the original. Here is,20250223
He does but do mischief with it to himself and others_ as a drunkard does with a thorn_ or any other sharp thing which he takes in his hand_ with which he tears himself and those about him_ because he knows not how to manage it. Those that talk well and do not live well_ their good words will aggravate their own condemnation and others will be hardened by their inconsistency with themselves. Some give this sense of it: The sharpest saying_ by which a sinner_ one would think_ should be pricked to the heart_ makes no more impression upon a fool_ no_ though it come out of his own mouth_ than the scratch of a thorn does upon the hand of a man when he is drunk_ who then feels it not nor complains of it_ ch. xxiii. 35.,20250223
He does but shame himself and his profession: As the legs of the lame are not equal_ by reason of which their going is unseemly_ so unseemly is it for a fool to pretend to speak apophthegms_ and give advice_ and for a man to talk devoutly whose conversation is a constant contradiction to his talk and gives him the lie. His good words raise him up_ but then his bad life takes him down_ and so his legs are not equal. __A wise saying___ (says bishop Patrick) __doth as ill become a fool as dancing doth a cripple; for_ as his lameness never so much appears as when he would seem nimble_ so the other's folly is never so ridiculous as when he would seem wise.__ As therefore it is best for a lame man to keep his seat_ so it is best for a silly man_ or a bad man_ to hold his tongue. ,20250223
He does it_ by showing that wicked people may_ in some instances_ prosper_ but that ruin follows them in those very instances; and that is their portion_ that is their heritage_ that is it which they must abide by.,20250223
He does many things and great_ many and great to admiration_ v,20250223
He does not care to get forward with his business; in that he stirs to and fro a little_ but to no purpose; he is where he was. Slothful professors turn_ in profession_ like the door upon the hinges. The world and the flesh are the two hinges on which they are hung_ and though they move in a course of external services_ have got into road of duties_ and tread around in them like the horse in the mill_ yet they get no good_ they get no ground_ they are never the nearer heaven—sinners unchanged_ saints unimproved.,20250223
He does not desire grace for his soul_ the better part; all he desires is enough to gratify the sensual appetite_ and that he has; his belly is filled with these hidden treasures_ Ps. xvii. 14.,20250223
He does not impose it upon Job to use these words_ but recommends it to him_ as that which was meet to be said. In general_ he would have him repent of his misconduct_ and indecent expressions_ under his affliction. Job's other friends would have had him own himself a wicked man_ and by overdoing they undid. Elihu will oblige him only to own that he had_ in the management of this controversy_ spoken unadvisedly with his lips. Let us remember this_ in giving reproofs_ and not make the matter worse than it is; for the stretching of the crime may defeat the prosecution. Elihu drives the right nail_ and speeds accordingly. He directs Job,20250223
He does not leave his business wholly to them_ but his own eyes run to and fro through the earth_ 2 Chron. xvi,20250223
He does not pretend to be sole dictator_ nor undertake to say what is just and good and what is not_ but he is willing to join with them in searching it out_ and desires a consultation: __Let us agree to lay aside all animosities and feuds_ all prejudices and affectation of contradiction_ and all stiffness in adhering to the opinion we have once espoused_ and let us choose to ourselves judgment; let us fix right principles on which to proceed_ and then take right methods for finding out truth; and let us know among ourselves_ by comparing notes and communicating our reasons_ what is good and what is otherwise.__ Note_ We are then likely to discern what is right when we agree to assist one another in searching it out.,20250223
He does not say_ __Lest I be rich_ and cumbered with care_ and envied by my neighbours_ and eaten up with a multitude of servants_ or_ lest I be poor and trampled on_ and forced to work hard and fare hard;__ but_ __Lest I be rich and sin_ or poor and sin.__ Sin is that which a good man is afraid of in every condition and under every event; witness Nehemiah (ch. vi. that I should be afraid_ and do so_ and sin. First_ He dreads the temptations of a prosperous condition_ and therefore even deprecates that: Lest I be full and deny thee (as Jeshurun_ who waxed fat and kicked_ and forsook God who made him_ Deut. and say_ as Pharaoh in his pride_ Who is the Lord_ that I should obey his voice? Prosperity makes people proud and forgetful of God_ as if they had no need of him and were therefore under no obligation to him. What can the Almighty do for them? Job xxii,20250223
He does_ in God's name_ bring an action against him_ for words which he had spoken_ in the heat of disputation_ reflecting upon God as dealing hardly with him_ ver. 8-11.,20250223
He doeth great things in the affairs of the children of men_ not only enriches the poor and comforts the needy_ by the rain he sends (v. but_ in order to the advancing of those that are low_ he disappoints the devices of the crafty; for v. 11 is to be joined to v,20250223
He draws some inferences from it_ which serve further to evince the truth of it. ,20250223
He dreaded the thought of doing what was wrong; with the utmost abhorrence and detestation_ and with a constant care and watchfulness_ he eschewed evil_ avoided all appearances of sin and approaches to it_ and this because of the fear of God_ Neh. v,20250223
He drinks so much that one would think he could drink up a river_ if you would give him time_ and not hasten him. Or_ when he drinks_ he hasteth not_ as those do that drink in fear; he is confident of his own strength and safety_ and therefore makes no haste when he drinks_ no more haste than good speed. ,20250223
He durst not insist upon his own justification before God. Though he vindicated his own integrity to his friends_ and would not yield that he was a hypocrite and a wicked man_ as they suggested_ yet he would never plead it as his righteousness before God. __I will never venture upon the covenant of innocency_ nor think to come off by virtue of that.__ Job knew so much of God_ and knew so much of himself_ that he durst not insist upon his own justification before God.,20250223
He dwells in cities which he himself has made desolate by expelling the inhabitants out of them_ that he might be placed alone in them_ Isa. v,20250223
He earnestly begs for the forgiveness of his sins_ v,20250223
He endeavoured to find out the number of his actual transgressions,20250223
He endeavours to convince him of his fault and folly herein_ by showing him,20250223
He endeavours to convince him that he had spoken amiss in speaking thus_ and that he ought to humble himself before God for it_ and by repentance to unsay it (v. 12): Behold_ in this thou art not just. Here thou art not in the right_ so some read it. See; the difference between the charge which Elihu exhibited against Job and that which was preferred against him by his other friends; they would not own that he was just at all_ but Elihu only says_ __In this_ in saying this_ thou art not just.__ 1. __Thou dost not deal justly with God.__ To be just is to render to all their due; now we do not render to God his due_ nor are we just to him_ if we do not acknowledge his equity and kindness in all his dispensations of his providence towards us_ that he is righteous in all his ways_ and that_ however it be_ yet he is good,20250223
He engages himself to prepare for death (ver. and encourages himself to hope that it would be comfortable to him_ ver,20250223
He enlarges upon the doctrine he had before maintained_ concerning the miser of wicked people and the ruin that attends them_ ver. 5-21. In this he seems_ all along_ to have an eye to Job's complaints of the miserable condition he was in_ that he was in the dark_ bewildered_ ensnared_ terrified_ and hastening out of the world. __This___ says Bildad_ __is the condition of a wicked man; and therefore thou art one.__,20250223
He enquires how far the business and wealth of this world will go towards making men happy_ and concludes_ from his own experience_ that_ to those who set their hearts upon it_ __it is vanity and vexation of spirit___ (ver. 17-23)_ and that_ if there be any good in it_ it is only to those that sit loose to it_ ver. 24-26.,20250223
He enriches himself with the spoils of all about him_ v,20250223
He excuses the passionate expressions he had used when he cursed his day. Though he could not himself justify all he had said_ yet he thought his friends should not thus violently condemn it_ for really the case was extraordinary_ and that might be connived at in such a man of sorrows as he now was which in any common grief would by no means be allowed,20250223
He exhibits a very high charge against Job_ as proud and false in justifying himself_ ver. 1-4.,20250223
He expostulates with the sluggard_ rebuking him and reasoning with him_ calling him to his work_ as a master does his servant that has over-slept himself: __How long wilt thou sleep_ O sluggard? How long wouldst thou sleep if one would let thee alone? When wilt thou think it time to arise?__ Sluggards should be roused with a How long? This is applicable_ ,20250223
He expresses the dread he had of that hypocrisy which they charged him with_ ver. 7-10.,20250223
He feels himself utterly unable to grapple with it_ either to escape it or to bear up under it. That which he relied upon as his strength (his wealth_ power_ pomp_ friends_ and the hardiness of his own spirit) shall fail him in the time of need_ and be hunger-bitten_ that is_ it shall do him no more service than a famished man_ pining away for hunger_ would do in work or war. The case being thus with him_ no marvel that he is a terror to himself. Note_ The way of sin is a way of fear_ and leads to everlasting confusion_ of which the present terrors of an impure and unpacified conscience are earnests_ as they were to Cain and Judas.,20250223
He finds that if God enters into judgment with him_ or he with himself_ for all his thoughts_ words_ and actions_ he is not able to answer for one of a thousand_ Job ix,20250223
He foresees their fall however_ and that their death_ though they die in ease and honour_ will be their ruin. God's eyes are upon their ways_ v,20250223
He foretels their ruin at length_ but after a long reprieve_ ver. 17-21,20250223
He forms dead things under the waters. Rephaim-giants_ are formed under the waters_ that is_ vast creatures_ of prodigious bulk_ as whales_ giant-like creatures_ among the innumerable inhabitants of the water. So bishop Patrick. ,20250223
He found the remembrance of the sin very grievous. O how heavily did it lie upon his conscience! what an agony was he in upon the thought of it—the wickedness_ the foolishness_ the madness_ that he had been guilty of! I find it more bitter than death. As great a terror seized him_ in reflection upon it_ as if he had been under the arrest of death. Thus do those that have their sins set in order before them by a sound conviction cry out against them; they are bitter as gall_ nay_ bitter as death_ to all true penitents. Uncleanness is a sin that is_ in its own nature_ more pernicious than death itself. Death may be made honourable and comfortable_ but this sin can be no other than shame and pain_ Prov. v. 9_ 11. ,20250223
He found the temptation to the sin very dangerous_ and that it was extremely difficult_ and next to impossible_ for those that ventured into the temptation to escape the sin_ and for those that had fallen into the sin to recover themselves by repentance. The heart of the adulterous woman is snares and nets; she plays her game to ruin souls with as much art and subtlety as ever any fowler used to take a silly bird. The methods such sinners use are both deceiving and destroying_ as snares and nets are. The unwary souls are enticed into them by the bait of pleasure_ which they greedily catch at and promise themselves satisfaction in; but they are taken before they are aware_ and taken irrecoverably. Her hands are as bands_ with which_ under colour of fond embraces_ she holds those fast that she has seized; they are held in the cords of their own sin_ Prov. v,20250223
He further describes their destruction (v. 9): By the blast of God they perish. The projects they take so much pains in are defeated; God cuts asunder the cords of those ploughers_ Ps. cxxix. 3_ 4. They themselves are destroyed_ which is the just punishment of their iniquity. They perish_ that is_ they are destroyed utterly; they are consumed_ that is_ they are destroyed gradually; and this by the blast and breath of God_ that is_ ,20250223
He gives a pious reason for his prayer_ v,20250223
He gives a reason for this caution_ taken from the end of that way which wicked man walk in. Envy not their prosperity; for_ ,20250223
He gives an instance_ for the proof of this doctrine in nature_ v,20250223
He gives her all the kind and most endearing titles imaginable: My sister_ my love_ my dove_ my undefiled; he not only gives her no hard names_ nor upbraids her with unkindness in not sitting up for him_ but_ on the contrary_ studies how to express his tender affection to her still. His loving-kindness he will not utterly take away. Those that by faith are espoused to Christ he looks upon as his sisters_ his loves_ his doves_ and all that is dear; and_ being clothed with his righteousness_ they are undefiled. This consideration should induce her to open to him. Christ's love to us should engage ours to him_ even in the most self-denying instances. Open to me. Can we deny entrance to such a friend_ to such a guest? Shall we not converse more with one that is infinitely worthy of our acquaintance_ and so affectionately desirous of it_ though we only can be gainers by it? 3. He pleads distress_ and begs to be admitted sub formâ pauperis—under the character of a poor traveller that wants a lodging: __My head is wet with the dew_ with the cold drops of the night; consider what hardships I have undergone_ to merit thee_ which surely may merit from thee so small a kindness as this.__ When Christ was crowned with thorns_ which no doubt fetched blood from his blessed head_ then was his head wet with the dew. __Consider what a grief it is to me to be thus unkindly used_ as much as it would be to a tender husband to be kept out of doors by his wife in a rainy stormy night.__ Do we thus require him for his love? The slights which careless souls put upon Jesus Christ are him as a continual dropping in a very rainy day.,20250223
He gives him good counsel_ yet perhaps not expecting he would take it_ the same that Eliphaz had given him (ch. v. to seek unto God_ and that betimes (that is_ speedily and seriously)_ and not to be dilatory and trifling in his return and repentance. He advises him not to complain_ but to petition_ to make his supplication to the Almighty with humility and faith_ and to see that there was (what he feared had hitherto been wanting) sincerity in his heart (__thou must be pure and upright__) and honesty in his house—__that must be the habitation of thy righteousness_ and not filled with ill-gotten goods_ else God will not hear thy prayers___ Ps. lxvi,20250223
He gives him good hopes that he shall yet again see good days_ secretly suspecting_ however_ that he was not qualified to see them. He assures him that_ if he would be early in seeking God_ God would awake for his relief_ would remember him and return to him_ though now he seemed to forget him and forsake him—that if his habitation were righteous it should be prosperity. When we return to God in a way of duty we have reason to hope that he will return to us in a way of mercy. Let not Job object that he had so little left to being the world with again that it was impossible he should ever prosper as he had done; no_ __Though thy beginning should be ever so small_ a little meal in the barrel and a little oil in the cruse_ God's blessing shall multiply that to a great increase.__ This is God's way of enriching the souls of his people with graces and comforts_ not per saltum—as by a bound_ but per gradum—step by step. The beginning is small_ but the progress is to perfection. Dawning light grows to noonday_ a grain of mustard seed to a great tree. Let us not therefore despise the day of small things_ but hope for the day of great things.,20250223
He gives him up for gone; alas! he is undone. he goes to the slaughter (for houses of uncleanness are slaughter-houses to precious souls); a dart will presently strike through his liver; going without his breast-plate_ he will receive his death's wound_ v,20250223
He gives him very good counsel_ assuring him that_ if he would take it_ God would return in mercy to him and he should return to his former prosperity_ ver. 21-30.,20250223
He gives many instances of it in God's powerful management of the children of men_ crossing their purposes and serving his own by them and upon them_ overruling all their counsels_ overpowering all their attempts_ and overcoming all their oppositions. What changes does God make with men! what turns does he give them! how easily_ how surprisingly!,20250223
He gives no countenance to the greatest_ if they be bad (v. 6): He preserves not the life of the wicked. Though their life may be prolonged_ yet not under any special care of the divine Providence_ but only its common protection. Job had said that the wicked live_ become old_ and are mighty in power_ ch. xxi,20250223
He gives some instances of God's wisdom_ power_ and sovereign dominion_ in the works of nature and the dispensations of common providence_ beginning in this chapter with the clouds and the rain that descends from them. We need not be critical in examining either the phrase or the philosophy of this noble discourse. The general scope of it is to show that God is infinitely great_ and the Lord of all_ the first cause and supreme director of all the creatures_ and has all power in heaven and earth (whom therefore we ought_ with all humility and reverence_ to adore_ to speak well of_ and to give honour to)_ and that it is presumption for us to prescribe to him the rules and methods of his special providence towards the children of men_ or to expect from him an account of them_ when the operations even of common providences about the meteors are so various and so mysterious and unaccountable. Elihu_ to affect Job with God's sublimity and sovereignty_ had directed him (ch. xxxv. 5) to look unto the clouds. In these verses he shows us what we may observe in the clouds we see which will lead us to consider the glorious perfections of their Creator. Consider the clouds_,20250223
He gives the preference to wisdom far before folly. Let none mistake him_ as if_ when he speaks of the vanity of human literature_ he designed only to amuse men with a paradox_ or were about to write (as a great wit once did) Encomium moriæ—A panegyric in praise of folly. No_ he is maintaining sacred truths_ and therefore is careful to guard against being misunderstood. I soon saw (says he) that there is an excellency in wisdom more than in folly_ as much as there is in light above darkness. The pleasures of wisdom_ though they suffice not to make men happy_ yet vastly transcend the pleasures of wine. Wisdom enlightens the soul with surprising discoveries and necessary directions for the right government of itself; but sensuality (for that seems to be especially the folly here meant) clouds and eclipses the mind_ and is as darkness to it; it puts out men's eyes_ makes them to stumble in the way and wander out of it. Or_ though wisdom and knowledge will not make a man happy (St. Paul shows a more excellent way than gifts_ and that is grace)_ yet it is much better to have them than to be without them_ in respect of our present safety_ comfort_ and usefulness; for the wise man's eyes are in his head (v. where they should be_ ready to discover both the dangers that are to be avoided and the advantages that are to be improved; a wise man has not his reason to seek when he should use it_ but looks about him and is quick-sighted_ knows both where to step and where to stop; whereas the fool walks in darkness_ and is ever and anon either at a loss_ or at a plunge_ either bewildered_ that he knows not which way to go_ or embarrassed_ that he cannot go forward. A man that is discreet and considerate has the command of his business_ and acts decently and safely_ as those that walk in the day; but he that is rash_ and ignorant_ and sottish_ is continually making blunders_ running upon one precipice or other; his projects_ his bargains_ are all foolish_ and ruin his affairs. Therefore get wisdom_ get understanding.,20250223
He gives them a lodgment in the heart and makes them to abide: He sealeth their instruction_ that is_ the instruction that is designed for them and is suited to them; this he makes their souls to receive the deep and lasting impression of_ as the wax of the seal. When the heart is delivered into divine instructions_ as into a mould_ then the work is done.,20250223
He gives them admission_ and makes them to be heeded: Then he opens the ears of men_ which were before shut against the voice of this charmer_ Ps. lviii,20250223
He gives us the reasons of it.,20250223
He governed himself by the commandment of God's lips_ and would not go back from that_ but go forward according to it. Whatever difficulties we may meet with in the way of God's commandments_ though they lead us through a wilderness_ yet we must never think of going back_ but must press on towards the mark. Job kept closely to the law of God in his conversation_ for both his judgment and his affection led him to it: I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food; that is_ he looked upon it as his necessary food; he could as well have lived without his daily bread as without the word of God. I have laid it up (so the word is)_ as those that lay up provision for a siege_ or as Joseph laid up corn before the famine. Eliphaz had told him to lay up God's words in his heart_ ch.,20250223
He grants that wicked men may for a time prosper_ may be secure and easy_ and very merry. You may see them in triumph and joy_ triumphing and rejoicing in their wealth and power_ their grandeur and success_ triumphing and rejoicing over their poor honest neighbours whom they vex and oppress: they feel no evil_ they fear none. Job's friends were loth to own_ at first_ that wicked people might prosper at all (ch. iv. until Job proved it plainly (ch. ix. 24_ xii. and now Zophar yields it; but_ ,20250223
He had a God to go to before whom he might unbosom himself_ v. 20_ 21. See here,20250223
He had a good estate for the support of his family; his substance was considerable_ v,20250223
He had a plentiful estate for the support of this numerous family_ v,20250223
He had as much pleasure in his business as ever any man had: My heart rejoiced in all my labour; so that the toil and fatigue of that were no damp to his pleasures. ,20250223
He had called her to rise and come away with him_ to let him see her face and hear her voice; now this is her answer to that call_ in which_ though at present in the dark and at a distance_,20250223
He had charged God with injustice in his dealings with him_ that he had wronged him in afflicting him and had not righted him: God has taken away my judgment; so Job had said_ ch. xxvii,20250223
He had complained of God as deaf to the cries of the oppressed_ against which imputation Elihu here justifies God_ ver. 9-13.,20250223
He had despaired of relief and concluded that God could not_ or would not_ help him: My wound is incurable_ and likely to be mortal_ and yet without transgression; not for any injustice in my hand_ ch. xvi. 16_ 17. ,20250223
He had despaired of the return of God's favour to him_ because it was so long deferred_ but Elihu shows him the true cause of the delay_ ver. 14-16.,20250223
He had had much inward comfort and delight_ but now he was a terror and burden to himself (ver. 15_ 16) and overwhelmed with sorrow_ ver. 28-31.,20250223
He had his royal seat in Jerusalem_ which then deserved_ better than Athens ever did_ to be called the eye of the world. The heart of a king is unsearchable; he has reaches of his own_ and a divine sentence is often in his lips. It is his honour_ it is his business_ to search out every matter. Solomon's great wealth and honour put him into a capacity of making his court the centre of learning and the rendezvous of learned men_ of furnishing himself with the best of books_ and either conversing or corresponding with all the wise and knowing part of mankind then in being_ who made application to him to learn of him_ by which he could not but improve himself; for it is in knowledge as it is in trade_ all the profit is by barter and exchange; if we have that to say which will instruct others_ they will have that to say which will instruct us. Some observe how slightly Solomon speaks of his dignity and honour. He does not say_ I the preacher am king_ but I was king_ no matter what I am. He speaks of it as a thing past_ because worldly honours are transitory,20250223
He had insisted upon his own innocency. Job hath said_ I am righteous (v. and_ when urged to confess his guilt_ had stiffly maintained his plea of_ Not guilty: Should I lie against my right? v,20250223
He had lived in great honour_ but now he had fallen into disgrace_ and was as much vilified_ even by the meanest_ as ever he had been magnified by the greatest; this he insists much on_ ver. 1-14.,20250223
He had long enjoyed a good state of health_ but now he was sick and in pain_ ver. 17-19_ 29_ 30.,20250223
He had no comfort of his life: My sighing comes before I eat_ v,20250223
He had no less profit by his business. He met with no disappointment in it to give him any disturbance: This was my portion of all my labour; he had this added to all the rest of his pleasures that in them he did not only see_ but eat_ the labour of his hands; and this was all he had_ for indeed it was all he could expect_ from his labours. It sweetened his business that he enjoyed the success of it_ and it sweetened his enjoyments that they were the product of his business; so that_ upon the whole_ he was certainly as happy as the world could make him.,20250223
He had no prospect of bettering his condition: His way was hidden_ and God had hedged him in_ v,20250223
He had no reason to think that there was anything in his prayers to recommend them to the divine acceptance_ or to fetch in an answer of peace_ no worth or worthiness at all to which to ascribe their success_ but it must be attributed purely to the grace and compassion of God_ who answers before we call and not because we call_ and gives gracious answers to our prayers_ but not for our prayers (v. 16): __If I had called_ and he had answered_ had given the thing I called to him for_ yet_ so weak and defective are my best prayers_ that I would not believe he had therein hearkened to my voice; I could not say that he had saved with his right hand and answered me__ (Ps. lx.,20250223
He had not been negligent and unmindful of his affairs_ but kept up such a fear of trouble as was necessary to the maintaining of his guard. He was afraid for his children when they were feasting_ lest they should offend God (ch. i. afraid for his servants lest they should offend his neighbours; he took all the care he could of his own health_ and managed himself and his affairs with all possible precaution; yet all would not do. ,20250223
He had not been secure_ nor indulged himself in ease and softness_ had not trusted in his wealth_ nor flattered himself with the hopes of the perpetuity of his mirth; yet trouble came_ to convince and remind him of the vanity of the world_ which yet he had not forgotten when he lived at ease. Thus his way was hidden_ for he knew not wherefore God contended with him. Now this consideration_ instead of aggravating his grief_ might rather serve to alleviate it. Nothing will make trouble easy so much as the testimony of our consciences for us_ that_ in some measure_ we did our duty in a day of prosperity; and an expectation of trouble will make it sit the lighter when it comes. The less it is a surprise the less it is a terror.,20250223
He had not kept them from himself_ but had given them full scope to operate upon him_ and in every thing to guide and govern him. He had not stifled his convictions_ imprisoned the truth in unrighteousness_ nor done any thing to hinder the digestion of this spiritual food and the operation of this spiritual physic. Let us never conceal God's word from ourselves_ but always receive it in the light of it. ,20250223
He had not kept them to himself_ but had been ready_ on all occasions_ to communicate his knowledge for the good of others_ was never ashamed nor afraid to own the word of God to be his rule_ nor remiss in his endeavours to bring others into an acquaintance with it. Note Those_ and those only_ may promise themselves comfort in death who are good_ and do good_ while they live.,20250223
He had nothing that he could take any comfort in. He abandoned himself to perpetual sorrow_ as one that_ like Jacob_ resolved to go to the grave mourning. He walked out of the sun (so some) in dark shady places_ as melancholy people use to do. If he went into the congregation_ to join with them in solemn worship_ instead of standing up calmly to desire their prayers_ he stood up and cried aloud_ through pain of body_ or anguish of mind_ like one half distracted. If he appeared in public_ to receive visits_ when the fit came upon him he could not contain himself_ nor preserve due decorum_ but stood up and shrieked aloud. Thus he was a brother to dragons and owls (v. both in choosing solitude and retirement_ as they do (Isa. xxxiv. and in making a fearful hideous noise as they do; his inconsiderate complaints were fitly compared to their inarticulate ones.,20250223
He had promised himself a long life_ but now he saw death at the door_ ver,20250223
He had represented God as severe in marking what he did amiss and taking all advantages against him (v. 10_ as if he sought opportunity to pick quarrels with him. He findeth occasions against me_ which supposes seeking them. To this purport Job had spoken_ ch. xiv. 16_ 17_ Dost thou not watch over my sin? He counteth me for his enemy; so he had expressly said_ ch. xiii. 24; xix,20250223
He had said (v. 2.)_ Rich and poor meet together; but here he finds_ here he shows_ that_ as to the things of this life_ there is a great difference; for,20250223
He had seven sons and three daughters_ v,20250223
He had spoken before of those that devoured the poor (v. and had spoken of them last_ as the worst of all the four generations there mentioned; now here he speaks of their insatiableness in doing this. The temper that puts them upon it is made up of cruelty and covetousness. Now those are two daughters of the horse-leech_ its genuine offspring_ that still cry_ __Give_ give_ give more blood_ give more money;__ for the bloody are still blood-thirsty; being drunk with blood_ they add thirst to their drunkenness_ and will seek it yet again. Those also that love silver shall never be satisfied with silver. Thus_ while from these two principles they are devouring the poor_ they are continually uneasy to themselves_ as David's enemies_ Ps. lix. 14_ 15. Now_ for the further illustration of this_,20250223
He had the hearts and affections of all his neighbours_ all his servants_ tenants_ subjects; never was man so much admired nor so well beloved. ,20250223
He had waited on Job's speeches_ had patiently heard him out_ until the words of Job were ended. ,20250223
He had waited on his friends' silence_ so that_ as he would not interrupt him_ so he would not prevent them_ not because they were wiser than he_ but because they were older than he_ and therefore it was expected by the company that they should speak first; and Elihu was very modest_ and would by no means offer to abridge them of their privilege. Some certain rules of precedency must be observed_ for the keeping of order. Though inward real honour will attend true wisdom and worth_ yet_ since every man will think himself or his friend the wisest and worthiest_ this can afford no certain rule for the outward ceremonial honour_ which therefore must attend seniority either of age or office; and this respect the seniors may the better require because they paid it when they were juniors_ and the juniors may the better pay because they shall have it when they come to be seniors.,20250223
He had_ in effect_ said that there is nothing to be got in the service of God and that no man will be the better at last for his (v. 9): He hath said that which gives occasion to suspect that he thinks it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. It is granted that there is a present pleasure in religion; for what is it but to delight ourselves with God_ in communion with him_ in concurrence with him_ in walking with him as Enoch did? this is a true notion of religion_ and bespeaks its ways to be pleasantness. Yet the advantage of it is denied_ as if it were vain to serve God_ Mal. iii,20250223
He hangs the earth upon nothing_ v.,20250223
He has a blessed tranquility of mind_ arising from the sense of his justification before God_ who will render unto this man his righteousness. He shall receive the atonement_ that is_ the comfort of it_ Rom. v,20250223
He has become a perfect skeleton_ nothing but skin and bones_ v,20250223
He has dominion over the lightning and the thunder_ which go not at random_ but in the way that he directs them. They are mentioned here because he prepares the lightnings for the rain_ Ps. cxxxv,20250223
He has enough for his back (as bishop Reynolds observes)_ for his belly_ for his calling_ for his family_ for his living decently in the world_ but he has not enough for his eyes. Though he can but see it_ can but count his money_ and not find in his heart to use it_ yet he is not easy because he has not more to regale his eyes with,20250223
He has entrusted each of us with his vineyard_ as keepers of it. The privileges of the church are that good thing which he has committed to us_ to be kept as a sacred trust. The service of the church is to be our business_ according as our capacity is. Son_ go work to-day in my vineyard. Adam_ in innocency_ was to dress the garden_ and to keep it.,20250223
He has gone to his rest_ to the place where he is to fix. He has gone to his home_ to the house of his world (so some)_ for this world is not his. He has gone to his long home_ for the days of his lying in the grave will be many. He has gone to his house of eternity_ not only to his house whence he shall never return to this world_ but to the house where he must be for ever. This should make us willing to die_ that_ at death_ we must go home; and why should we not long to go to our Father's house? And this should quicken us to get ready to die_ that we must then go to our long home_ to an everlasting habitation. ,20250223
He has no burial_ none agreeable to his rank_ no decent burial_ but the burial of an ass. Through the sordidness of his temper he will not allow himself a fashionable burial_ but forbids it_ or the strangers that have eaten him up leave him so poor_ at last_ that he has not wherewithal_ or those to whom he leaves what he has have so little esteem for his memory_ and are so greedy of what they are to have from him_ that they will not be at the charges of burying him handsomely_ which his own children_ if he had left it to them_ would not have grudged him.,20250223
He has no excuse for doing this: He has neither child nor brother_ none that he is bound to_ on whom he may lay out what he has to his satisfaction while he lives_ none that he has a kindness for_ for whom he may lay it up to his satisfaction and to whom he may leave it when he dies_ none that are poor or dear to him,20250223
He has no good design in it_ only that his heart may discover itself_ that he may have something to make a show with_ something wherewith to varnish his folly_ that that may pass off the better_ because he loves to hear himself talk.,20250223
He has no owner_ nor will he be in subjection: He scorns the multitude of the city. If they attempt to take him_ and in order to that surround him with a multitude_ he will soon get clear of them_ and the crying of the driver is nothing to him. He laughs at those that live in the tumult and bustle of cities (so bishop Patrick)_ thinking himself happier in the wilderness; and opinion is the rate of things. ,20250223
He has not consideration enough to show himself the folly of this. He never puts this question to himself_ __For whom do I labour thus? Do I labour_ as I should_ for the glory of God_ and that I may have to give to those that need? Do I consider that it is but for the body that I am labouring_ a dying body; it is for others_ and I know not for whom—perhaps for a fool_ that will scatter it as fast as I have gathered it—perhaps for a foe_ that will be ungrateful to my memory?__ Note_ It is wisdom for those that take pains about this world to consider whom they take all this pains for_ and whether it be really worth while to bereave themselves of good that they may bestow it on a stranger. If men do not consider this_ it is vanity_ and a sore travail; they shame and vex themselves to no purpose.,20250223
He has not that ease in his own mind that people think he has_ but is in continual agitation. The ill-gotten wealth which he has swallowed down makes him sick_ and_ like undigested meat_ is always upbraiding him. Let none expect to enjoy that comfortably which they have gotten unjustly. The unquietness of his mind arises_ ,20250223
He has not wherewithal to fee a physician or surgeon; and_ which is most sad of all_ none of those he had formerly been kind to had so much sense of honour and gratitude as to minister to him in his distress_ and lend him a hand to dress or wipe his running sores_ either because the disease was loathsome and noisome or because they apprehended it to be infectious. Thus it was in the former days_ as it will be in the last days_ men were lovers of their own selves_ unthankful_ and without natural affection. ,20250223
He has nothing to do this with but a potsherd_ no surgeon's instrument proper for the purpose_ but that which would rather rake into his wounds_ and add to his pain_ than give him any ease. People that are sick and sore have need to be under the discipline and direction of others_ for they are often but bad managers of themselves.,20250223
He has quite lost his appetite_ the common effect of sickness (v. 20): His life abhorreth bread_ the most necessary food_ and dainty meat_ which he most delighted in_ and formerly relished with a great deal of pleasure. This is a good reason why we should not be desirous of dainties_ because they are deceitful meat_ Prov.,20250223
He has spirit equal to his bodily strength_ and_ though he is bulky_ he is sprightly_ and not unwieldy. As his flesh and skin cannot be pierced_ so his courage cannot be daunted; but_ on the contrary_ he daunts all he meets and puts them into a consternation (v. 25): When he raises up himself like a moving mountain in the great waters even the mighty are afraid lest he should overturn their ships or do them some other mischief. By reason of the breakings he makes in the water_ which threaten death_ they purify themselves_ confess their sins_ betake themselves to their prayers_ and get ready for death. We read (ch. iii. 8) of those who_ when they raise up a leviathan_ are in such a fright that they curse the day. It was a fear which_ it seems_ used to drive some to their curses and others to their prayers; for_ as now_ so then there were seafaring men of different characters and on whom the terrors of the sea have contrary effects; but all agree there is a great fright among them when the leviathan raises up himself. ,20250223
He hastens to conclude_ now that God is about to speak; and therefore delivers much in a few words_ as the sum of all that he had been discoursing of_ which_ if duly considered_ would not only clench the nail he had been driving_ but make way for what God would say. He observes_ ,20250223
He hath shown thee_ O man! not what is great_ but what is good_ not what the Lord thy God designs to do with thee_ but what he requires of thee_ Mic. vi,20250223
He hereby complains of it as his unhappiness that his friends undertook to administer spiritual physic to him before they thoroughly understood his case and knew the worst of it. It is seldom that those who are at ease themselves rightly weigh the afflictions of the afflicted. Every one feels most from his own burden; few feel from other people's,20250223
He himself might justly be made a public example: For it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges; yea_ though those who are guilty of it are themselves judges_ as Job was. Note_ Adultery is a crime which the civil magistrate ought to take cognizance of and punish: so it was adjudged even in the patriarchal age_ before the law of Moses made it capital. It is an evil work_ to which the sword of justice ought to be a terror. ,20250223
He himself was amazed at it_ at the troubles God had laid upon him and the censures of his friends concerning him (v. 6): __When I remember that terrible day in which I was on a sudden stripped of all my comforts_ that day in which I was stricken with sore boils_—when I remember all the hard speeches with which you have grieved me_—I confess I am afraid_ and trembling takes hold of my flesh_ especially when I compare this with the prosperous condition of many wicked people_ and the applauses of their neighbours_ with which they pass through the world.__ Note_ The providences of God_ in the government of the world_ are sometimes very astonishing even to wise and good men_ and bring them to their wits' end. ,20250223
He hoped to convince them. __If you will but give me a fair hearing_ mock on if you can_ but I believe I shall say that which will change your note and make you pity me rather than mock me.__ ,20250223
He humbles himself to take cognizance of the affairs of the meanest_ to do them justice and to show them kindness. Job thought himself and his cause slighted because God did not immediately appear for him. __No___ says Elihu_ God despises not any_ which is a good reason why we should honour all men. He is mighty in strength and wisdom_ and yet does not look with contempt upon those that have but a little strength and wisdom_ if they but mean honestly. Nay_ for this reason he despises not any_ because his wisdom and strength are incontestably infinite and therefore the condescensions of his grace can be no diminution to him. Those that are wise and good will not look upon any with scorn and disdain.,20250223
He humbly pleads with God his own utter inability to stand before him (v. 25): __Wilt thou break a leaf_ pursue the dry stubble? Lord_ is it for thy honour to trample upon one that is down already_ or to crush one that neither has nor pretends to any power to resist thee?__ Note_ We ought to have such an apprehension of the goodness and compassion of God as to believe that he will not break the bruised reed_ Matt. xii. 20.,20250223
He illustrates this truth by some similitudes.,20250223
He ingenuously owns himself guilty before God: I have sinned. God had said of him that he was a perfect and an upright man; yet he says of himself_ I have sinned. Those may be upright who yet are not sinless; and those who are sincerely penitent are accepted_ through a Mediator_ as evangelically perfect. Job maintained_ against his friends_ that he was not a hypocrite_ not a wicked man; and yet he owned to his God that he had sinned. If we have been kept from gross acts of sin_ it does not therefore follow that we are innocent. The best must acknowledge_ before God_ that they have sinned. His calling God the observer_ or preserver_ of men_ may be looked upon as designed for an aggravation of his sin: __Though God has had his eye upon me_ his eye upon me for good_ yet I have sinned against him.__ When we are in affliction it is seasonable to confess sin_ as the procuring cause of our affliction. Penitent confessions would drown and silence passionate complaints. ,20250223
He insisted not upon any points of honour_ but humbled himself under humbling providences: He defiled his horn in the dust_ and refused the respect that used to be paid to his dignity_ power_ and eminency. Note_ When God brings down our condition_ that should bring down our spirits. Better lay the horn in the dust than lift it up in contradiction to the designs of Providence and have it broken at last. Eliphaz had represented Job as high and haughty_ and unhumbled under his affliction. __No___ says Job_ __I know better things; the dust is now the fittest place for me.__ 3. He banished mirth as utterly unseasonable_ and set himself to sow in tears (v. 16): __My face is foul with weeping so constantly for my sins_ for God's displeasure against me_ and for my friends unkindness: this has brought a shadow of death upon my eyelids.__ He had not only wept away all his beauty_ but almost wept his eyes out. In this also he was a type of Christ_ who was a man of sorrows_ and much in tears_ and pronounced those blessed that mourn_ for they shall be comforted.,20250223
He is a God of irresistible power: Is there any number of his armies? v,20250223
He is a King in respect both of dignity and dominion; he wears the crown of honour_ he bears the sceptre of power_ both which are the unspeakable satisfaction of all his people. This King has his royal table spread in the gospel_ in which is made for all nations a feast of fat things_ Isa. xxv,20250223
He is a foolish creature_ has become like the beasts that perish (Ps. xlix. 20_ lxxiii. an idiot_ born like an ass_ the most stupid animal_ an ass's colt_ not yet brought to any service. If ever he come to be good for any thing_ it is owing to the grace of Christ_ who once_ in the day of his triumph_ served himself by an ass's colt,20250223
He is a living Redeemer. As we are made by a living God_ so we are saved by a living Redeemer_ who is both almighty and eternal_ and is therefore able to save to the uttermost. Of him it is witnessed that he liveth_ Heb. vii. 8; Rev. i,20250223
He is a wilful ungovernable creature. An ass's colt may be made good for something_ but the wild ass's colt will never be reclaimed_ nor regards the crying of the driver. See Job xxxix. 5-7. Man thinks himself as much at liberty_ and his own master_ as the wild ass's colt does_ that is used to the wilderness (Jer. ii. eager to gratify his own appetites and passions,20250223
He is always ready to right those that are any way injured_ and to plead their cause (v. 6): He gives right to the poor_ avenges their quarrel upon their persecutors and forces them to make restitution of what they have robbed them of. If men will not right the injured poor_ God will.,20250223
He is but where he must have been at last_ and is only unclothed_ or unloaded rather_ a little sooner than he expected. If we put off our clothes before we go to bed_ it is some inconvenience_ but it may be the better borne when it is near bed-time.,20250223
He is but where he was at first. He looks upon himself only as naked_ not maimed_ not wounded; he was himself still his own man_ when nothing else was his own_ and therefore but reduced to his first condition. Nemo tam pauper potest esse quam natus est—no one can be so poor as he was when born.—Min. Felix. If we are impoverished_ we are not wronged_ nor much hurt_ for we are but as we were born. ,20250223
He is confident that his ruin will accordingly be very great_ and his fall the more dreadful for his having risen so high: He shall perish for ever_ v,20250223
He is continually uneasy at the thought of the cruelties he as been guilty of and the blood in which he has imbrued his hands. His sins stare him in the face at every turn. Diri conscia facti mens habet attonitos—Conscious guilt astonishes and confounds. Secondly_ He is vexed at the uncertainty of the continuance of his wealth and power: The number of years is hidden to the oppressor. He knows_ whatever he pretends_ that they will not last always_ and has reason to fear that they will not last long and this he frets at. Thirdly_ He is under a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fiery indignation (Heb. x. which puts him into_ and keeps him in_ a continual terror and consternation_ so that he dwells with Cain in the land of Nod_ or commotion (Gen. iv. and is made like_ Pashur_ Magor-missabib—a terror round about_ Jer.,20250223
He is deprived of his pleasure by day_ for all his days are sorrow_ not only sorrowful_ but sorrow itself_ nay_ many sorrows and various; his travail_ or labour_ all day_ is grief. Men of business ever and anon meet with that which vexes them_ and is an occasion of anger or sorrow to them. Those that are apt to fret find that the more dealings they have in the world the oftener they are made to fret. The world is a vale of tears_ even to those that have much of it. Those that labour are said to be heavy-laden_ and are therefore called to come to Christ for rest_ Matt. xi,20250223
He is disturbed in his repose by night. When he is overcome with the hurries of the day_ and hopes to find relief when he lays his head on his pillow_ he is disappointed there; cares hold his eyes waking_ or_ if he sleep_ yet his heart wakes_ and that takes no rest in the night. See what fools those are that make themselves drudges to the world_ and do not make God their rest; night and day they cannot but be uneasy. So that_ upon the whole matter_ it is all vanity_ v,20250223
He is even ashamed of what he has said_ not of the cause_ but of his own management of it: __Shall it be told him that I speak? v,20250223
He is going to that world where he will be a perfect stranger to all those things which here filled and affected him. The consideration of this should moderate our cares concerning our children and families. God will know what comes of them when we are gone. To him therefore let us commit them_ with him let us leave them_ and not burden ourselves with needless fruitless cares concerning them. ,20250223
He is higher than the kings of the earth (Ps. lxxxix. 27) and has obtained a more excellent name than any of the principalities and powers of the upper or lower world_ Phil. ii. 9; Heb. i. iv.. He is a standard-bearer among ten thousand (so the word is)_ the tallest and comeliest of the company. He is himself lifted up as an ensign (Isa. xi. to whom we must be gathered and must always have an eye. And there is all the reason in the world why he should have the innermost and uppermost place in our souls who is the fairest of ten thousands in himself and the fittest of twenty thousands for us.,20250223
He is himself preparing for his own destruction by going on in sin_ and so treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath. God gives him up_ as he deserves and desires_ to his own counsels_ and then his own counsels cast him down_ v,20250223
He is in imminent danger of adultery_ as he that takes fire in his bosom_ or goes upon hot coals_ is in danger of being burnt. The way of this sin is down-hill_ and those that venture upon the temptations to it hardly escape the sin itself. The fly fools away her life by playing the wanton with the flames. It is a deep pit_ which it is madness to venture upon the brink of. He that keeps company with those of ill fame_ that goes in with them_ and touches them_ cannot long preserve his innocency; he thrusts himself into temptation and so throws himself out of God's protection. ,20250223
He is in one mind_ and who can turn him? His measures are never broken_ nor is he ever put upon new counsels_ but what he has purposed shall be effected_ and all the world cannot defeat nor disannul it. It behoves us therefore to say_ __Let it be as God wills___ for_ how cross soever it may be to our designs and interests_ God's will is his wisdom,20250223
He is mightier than the proud waves Ps. xciii. 4;,20250223
He is miserable after death. ,20250223
He is miserable in death. It is to him the king of terrors_ v. 20_ 21. When some mortal disease seizes him what a fright is he in! Terrors take hold of him as waters_ as if he were surrounded by the flowing tides. He trembles to think of leaving this world_ and much more of removing to another. This mingles sorrow and wrath with his sickness_ as Solomon observes_ Eccl. v,20250223
He is nigh to them_ a present help_ in all that they call upon him for.,20250223
He is of invincible strength and most terrible fierceness_ so that he frightens all that come in his way_ but is not himself frightened by any. Take a view of his neck_ and there remains strength_ v,20250223
He is omnipotent. He can do every thing_ and is very exact in all he does. For proof of this Job mentions the winds and waters_ v,20250223
He is so oppressed and overwhelmed with his troubles that he cannot look up with any comfort or confidence. Without were fightings_ within were fears; so that_ between both_ he was full of confusion_ not only confusion of face for the disgrace he was brought down to and the censures of his friends_ but confusion of spirit; his mind was in a constant hurry_ and he was almost distracted_ Ps. lxxxviii. 15.,20250223
He is still unsatisfied and uneasy. His hands are filled with riches_ his barns filled_ and his bags filled_ but his soul is not filled with good_ no_ not with that good_ for it is still craving more. Nay (v. he has not seen good; he cannot so much as please his eye_ for that is still looking further and looking with envy on those that have more. He has not even the sensible good of an estate. Though he looks not beyond the things that are seen_ yet he looks not with any true pleasure even on them,20250223
He is sure that God does not discover things_ nor judge of them_ as men do: He has not eyes of flesh (v. for he is a Spirit. Eyes of flesh cannot see in the dark_ but darkness hides not from God. Eyes of flesh are but in one place at a time_ and can see but a little way; but the eyes of the Lord are in every place_ and run to and fro through the whole earth. Many things are hidden from eyes of flesh_ the most curious and piercing; there is a path which even the vulture's eye has not seen: but nothing is_ or can be_ hidden from the eye of God_ to which all things are naked and open. Eyes of flesh see the outward appearance only_ and may be imposed upon by a deceptio visus—an illusion of the senses; but God sees every thing truly. His sight cannot be deceived_ for he tries the heart_ and is a witness to the thoughts and intents of that. Eyes of flesh discover things gradually_ and_ when we gain the sight of one thing_ we lose the sight of another; but God sees every thing at one view. Eyes of flesh are soon tired_ must be closed every night but the keeper of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps_ nor does his sight ever decay. God sees not as man sees_ that is_ he does not judge as man judges_ at the best secundum allegata et probata—according to what is alleged and proved_ as the thing appears rather than as it is_ and too often according to the bias of the affections_ passions_ prejudices_ and interest; but we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth_ and that he knows truth_ not by information_ but by his own inspection. Men discover secret things by search_ and examination of witnesses_ comparing evidence and giving conjectures upon it_ wheedling or forcing the parties concerned to confess; but God needs not any of these ways of discovery: he sees not as man sees.,20250223
He is sure that as God is not short-sighted_ like man_ so he is not short-lived (v. 5): __Are thy days as the days of man_ few and evil? Do they roll on in succession_ or are they subject to change_ like the days of man? No_ by no means.__ Men grow wiser by experience and more knowing by daily observation; with them truth is the daughter of time_ and therefore they must take time for their searches_ and_ if one experiment fail_ must try another. But it is not so with God; to him nothing is past_ nothing future_ but every thing present. The days of time_ by which the life of man is measured_ are nothing to the years of eternity_ in which the life of God is wrapped up. ,20250223
He is then brought to the king of terrors. He was surrounded with terrors while he lived,20250223
He is then chased out of the world_ hurried and dragged away by the messengers of death_ sorely against his will_ chased as Adam out of paradise_ for the world is his paradise. It intimates that he would fain stay here; he is loth to depart_ but go he must; all the world is weary of him_ and therefore chases him out_ as glad to get rid of him. This is death to a wicked man.,20250223
He is then driven from the light into darkness (v. from the light of this world_ and his prosperous condition in it_ into darkness_ the darkness of the grave_ the darkness of hell_ into utter darkness_ never to see light (Ps. xlix. not the least gleam_ nor any hopes of it. ,20250223
He is to be adjudged unclean and unrighteous because born of a woman_ from whom he derives a corrupt nature_ which is both his guilt and his pollution. With these plain truths Eliphaz thinks to convince Job_ whereas he had just now said the same (ch. xiv.,20250223
He is to be reckoned an intelligent man that not only has wisdom_ but has it ready when he has occasion for it. He lays his wisdom before him_ as his card and compass which he steers by_ has his eye always upon it_ as he that writes has on his copy; and then he has it before him; it is not to seek_ but still at hand,20250223
He is very bold with his God. 1. In some expressions his faith is very bold_ yet that is not more bold than welcome_ ver. 15_ 16_ 18. But_ 2. In other expressions his passion is rather too bold in expostulations with God concerning the deplorable condition he was in (ver. 14_ 19_ &c.)_ complaining of the confusion he was in (ver. 20-22)_ and the loss he was at to find out the sin that provoked God thus to afflict him_ and in short of the rigour of God's proceedings against him_ ver. 23-28.,20250223
He is very bold with his friends_ comparing himself with them_ notwithstanding the mortifications he was under_ ver. 1_ 2. Condemning them for their falsehood_ their forwardness to judge_ their partiality and deceitfulness under colour of pleading God's cause (ver. 4-8)_ and threatening them with the judgments of God for their so doing (ver. 9-12)_ desiring them to be silent (ver. 5_ 13_ and turning from them to God_ ver. 3.,20250223
He is very fond of it_ as the spider of her web; pleases himself with it_ wraps himself in it_ calls it his house_ leans upon it_ and holds it fast. It is said of the spider that she takes hold with her hands_ and is in kings' palaces_ Prov. xxx,20250223
He is welcome to make what objections he can against it (v. 32): __If thou hast any thing to say for thyself_ in thy own vindication_ answer me; though I am fresh_ and thou art spent_ I will not run thee down with words: Speak_ for I_ desire to justify thee_ and am not as thy other friends that desired to condemn thee.__ Elihu contends for truth_ not_ as they did_ for victory. Note_ Those we reprove we should desire to justify_ and be glad to see them clear themselves from the imputations they lie under_ and therefore give them all possible advantage and encouragement to do so. ,20250223
He is willing to forfeit the whole cargo if there be found any prohibited or contraband goods_ any thing but what he came honestly by (v. 8): __Let me sow_ and let another eat___ which was already agreed to be the doom of oppressors (ch. v.,20250223
He is willing to have his goods searched (v. 6): Let me be weighed in an even balance_ that is_ __Let what I have got be enquired into and it will be found to weigh well__—a sign that it was not obtained by vanity_ for then Tekel would have been written on it—weighed in the balance and found too light. An honest man is so far from dreading a trial that he desires it rather_ being well assured that God knows his integrity and will approve it_ and that the trial of it will be to his praise and honour. ,20250223
He is_ in a sense_ the Father of the rain_ v,20250223
He justifies God in what he had done. This he had no occasion to do at this time (for Job did not condemn God_ as he would have it thought he did)_ or he might at least have done it without reflecting upon Job's children_ as he does here. Could he not be an advocate for God but he must be an accuser of the brethren? 1. He is right in general_ that God doth not pervert judgment_ nor ever go contrary to any settled rule of justice_ v,20250223
He keeps the waters that are said to be above the firmament from pouring down upon the earth_ as once they did (v. 8): He binds up the waters in his thick clouds_ as if they were tied closely in a bag_ till there is occasion to use them; and_ notwithstanding the vast weight of water so raised and laid up_ yet the cloud is not rent under them_ for then they would burst and pour out as a spout; but they do_ as it were_ distil through the cloud_ and so come drop by drop_ in mercy to the earth_ in small rain_ or great rain_ as he pleases. ,20250223
He kept bad company. He was a young man among the youths_ a silly young man among the simple ones. If_ being conscious of his own weakness_ he had associated with those that were older and wiser than himself_ there would have been hopes of him. Christ_ at twelve years old_ conversed with the doctors_ to set young people an example of this. But_ if those that are simple choose such for their companions as are like themselves_ simple they will still be_ and hardened in their simplicity,20250223
He kept his heart with all diligence_ that that should not be secretly enticed to think that there is a divine glory in their brightness_ or a divine power in their influence_ and that therefore divine honours are to be paid to them. Here is the source of idolatry; it begins in the heart. Every man is tempted to that_ as to other sins_ when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. ,20250223
He kept out of the reach of their instruments of slaughter_ or_ if they touched him_ they could not touch him to the quick,20250223
He knew nothing of the founding of the earth_ ver. 4-7,20250223
He knows and considers whether the excuse we make be true or no_ whether it was because we did not know it or whether the true reason was not because we did not love our neighbour as we ought_ but were selfish_ and regardless both of God and man. Let this serve to silence all our frivolous pleas_ by which we think to stop the mouth of conscience when it charges us with the omission of plain duty: Does not he that ponders the heart consider it? ,20250223
He knows not whom he must leave it to (for God makes heirs)_ or at least what he will prove to whom he leaves it_ whether a wise man or a fool_ a wise man that will make it more or a fool that will bring it to nothing; yet he shall have rule over all my labour_ and foolishly undo that which his father wisely did. It is probable that Solomon wrote this very feelingly_ being afraid what Rehoboam would prove. St Jerome_ in his commentary on this passage_ applies this to the good books which Solomon wrote_ in which he had shown himself wise_ but he knew not into whose hands they would fall_ perhaps into the hands of a fool_ who_ according to the perverseness of his heart_ makes a bad use of what was well written. So that_ upon the whole matter_ he asks (v.,20250223
He knows particularly the hearts of the children of men. If he sees through the depths and wiles of Satan himself_ much more can he search men's hearts_ though they be deceitful_ since they learned all their fraudulent arts of Satan. God is greater than our hearts_ and knows them better than we know them ourselves_ and therefore is an infallible Judge of every man's character_ Heb. iv. 13.,20250223
He knows that both heaven and earth are incensed against him_ that God is angry with him and that all the world hates him; he has done nothing to make his peace with either_ and therefore he thinks that every one who meets him will slay him_ Gen. iv,20250223
He laments his own iniquity_ as that which was more vexatious than any of these vanities_ that mystery of iniquity_ the having of many wives_ by which he was drawn away from God and his duty_ ver. 23-29.,20250223
He lays down his own judgment to the contrary_ and_ for proof of it_ appeals to the sentiments and observations of all mankind. So confident is he that he is in the right that he is willing to refer the cause to the next man that comes by (v. 29): __Have you not asked those that go by the way—any indifferent person_ any that will answer you? I say not_ as Eliphaz (ch. v. 1)_ to which of the saints_ but to which of the children of men will you turn? Turn to which you will_ and you will find them all of my mind_ that the punishment of sinners is designed more for the other world than for this_ according to the prophecy of Enoch_ the seventh from Adam_ Jude 14. Do you not know the tokens of this truth_ which all that have made any observations upon the providences of God concerning mankind in this world can furnish you with?__ Now_,20250223
He lays it down for a certain truth that they will not prosper long. Their joy is but for a moment_ and will quickly end in endless sorrow. Though he be ever so great_ and rich_ and jovial_ the hypocrite will be humbled_ and mortified_ and made miserable.,20250223
He lays this down for a rule_ that the love and hatred of God are not to be measured and judged of by men's outward condition. If prosperity were a certain sign of God's love_ and affliction of his hatred_ then it might justly be an offence to us to see the wicked and godly fare alike. But the matter is not so: No man knows either love or hatred by all that is before him in this world_ by those things that are the objects of sense. These we may know by that which is within us; if we love God with all our heart_ thereby we may know that he loves us_ as we may know likewise that we are under his wrath if we be governed by that carnal mind which is enmity to him. These will be known by that which shall be hereafter_ by men's everlasting state; it is certain that men are happy or miserable according as they are under the love or hatred of God_ but not according as they are under the smiles or frowns of the world; and therefore if God loves a righteous man (as certainly he does) he is happy_ though the world frown upon him; and if he hates a wicked man (as certainly he does) he is miserable_ though the world smile upon him. Then the offence of this promiscuous distribution of events has ceased.,20250223
He lived till he was satisfied_ for he died full of days_ satisfied with living in this world_ and willing to leave it; not peevishly so_ as in the days of his affliction_ but piously so_ and thus_ as Eliphaz had encouraged him to hope_ he came to his grave like a shock of corn in his season.,20250223
He looked upon it as a much greater affront to the God of heaven_ and no less than high treason against his crown and dignity: For I should have denied the God that is above_ denied his being as God and his sovereignty as God above. Idolatry is_ in effect_ atheism; hence the Gentiles are said to be without God (atheists) in the world. Note_ We should be afraid of every thing that does but tacitly deny the God above_ his providence_ or any of his perfections.,20250223
He looked upon it as an affront to the civil magistrate: It were an iniquity to be punished by the judge_ as a public nuisance_ and hurtful to kings and provinces. Idolatry debauches men's minds_ corrupts their manners_ takes off the true sense of religion which is the great bond of societies_ and provokes God to give men up to a reprobate sense_ and to send judgments upon a nation; and therefore the conservators of the public peace are concerned to restrain it by punishing it. ,20250223
He looks upon sinners with an eye of compassion_ desiring to hear this from them; for he has no pleasure in their ruin. He looks upon them_ and_ as soon as he perceives these workings of repentance in them_ he encourages them and is ready to accept them (Ps. xxxii. 5_ as the father went forth to meet the returning prodigal.,20250223
He made a great show and a great noise for a time_ but he is gone of a sudden_ and neither root nor branch is left him_ Mal. iv. 1. This is the joy (that is_ this is the end and conclusion) of the wicked man's way (v. 19); this is that which all his joy comes to. The way of the ungodly shall perish_ Ps. i,20250223
He made a very great progress in his studies_ wonderfully improved all the parts of learning_ and carried his discoveries much further than any that had been before him. He did not condemn learning_ as many do_ because they cannot conquer it and will not be at the pains to make themselves masters of it; no_ what he aimed at he compassed; he saw all the works that were done under the sun (v. works of nature in the upper and lower world_ all within this vortex (to use the modern gibberish) which has the sun for its centre_ works of art_ the product of men's wit_ in a personal or social capacity. He had as much satisfaction in the success of his searches as ever any man had; he communed with his own heart concerning his attainments in knowledge_ with as much pleasure as ever any rich merchant had in taking account of his stock. He could say_ __Lo_ I have magnified and increased wisdom_ have not only gotten more of it myself_ but have done more to propagate it and bring it into reputation_ than any_ than all that have been before me in Jerusalem.__ Note_ It becomes great men to be studious_ and delight themselves most in intellectual pleasures. Where God gives great advantages of getting knowledge he expects improvements accordingly. It is happy with a people when their princes and noblemen study to excel others as much in wisdom and useful knowledge as they do in honour and estate; and they may do that service to the commonwealth of learning by applying themselves to the studies that are proper for them which meaner persons cannot do. Solomon must be acknowledged as competent judge of this matter_ for he had not only got his head full of notions_ but his heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge_ of the power and benefit of knowledge_ as well as the amusement and entertainment of it; what he knew he had digested_ and knew how to make use of. Wisdom entered into his heart_ and so became pleasant to his soul_ Prov. ii. 10_ 11; xxii. 18,20250223
He made him with man_ as he made other four-footed beasts_ on the same day with man (Gen. i. 25_ whereas the fish and fowl were made the day before; he made him to live and move on the same earth_ in the same element_ and therefore man and beast are said to be jointly preserved by divine Providence as fellow-commoners_ Ps. xxxvi,20250223
He made it his business to acquaint himself with all the things that are done under the sun_ that are done by the providence of God or by the art and prudence of man. He set himself to get all the insight he could into philosophy and mathematics_ into husbandry and trade_ merchandise and mechanics_ into the history of former ages and the present state of other kingdoms_ their laws_ customs_ and policies_ into men's different tempers_ capacities_ and projects_ and the methods of managing them; he set himself not only to seek_ but to search_ to pry into_ that which is most intricate_ and which requires the closes application of mind and the most vigorous and constant prosecution. Though he was a prince_ he made himself a drudge to learning_ was not discouraged by its knots_ nor took up short of its depths. And this he did_ not merely to gratify his own genius_ but to qualify himself for the service of God_ and his generation_ and to make an experiment how far the enlargement of the knowledge would go towards the settlement and repose of the mind,20250223
He made this vast animal_ which is so fearfully and wonderfully made; it is the work of his hands_ the contrivance of his wisdom_ the production of his power; it is behemoth which I made_ v,20250223
He maintains his point_ that we cannot judge of men's character by their outward condition_ ver. 22-24,20250223
He maintains that the riches that are more than these_ that are for hoarding_ not for use_ are vain things_ and will not make a man easy or happy. That which our Saviour has said (Luke xii.,20250223
He make some poor_ to exercise their patience_ and contentment_ and dependence upon God_ and others rich_ to exercise their thankfulness and beneficence. Even the poor we have always with us; they shall never cease out of the land_ nor the rich neither,20250223
He makes but a bad use of these good truths. Had he duly considered them_ he might have said_ __Therefore am I easy and pleased_ and well reconciled to the way of my God concerning me; therefore will I rejoice in hope that my troubles will issue well at last.__ But he said_ Therefore am I troubled at his presence_ v,20250223
He makes the constellations; three are named for all the rest (v.,20250223
He makes them a punishment to a bad man if he denies him a heart to take the comfort of them_ for they do but tantalize him and tyrannize over him: To the sinner God gives by travail_ by leaving him to himself and his own foolish counsels_ to gather and to heap up that_ which_ as to himself_ will not only burden him like thick clay (Hab. ii. but be a witness against him and eat his flesh as it were fire (Jam. v. 3); while God designs_ by an overruling providence_ to give it to him that is good before him; for the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just_ and gathered for him that will pity the poor. Note_ First_ Godliness_ with contentment_ is great gain; and those only have true joy that are good in God's sight_ and that have it from him and in him. Secondly_ Ungodliness is commonly punished with discontent and an insatiable covetousness_ which are sins that are their own punishment. Thirdly_ When God gives abundance to wicked men it is with design to force them to a resignation in favour of his own children_ when they are of age and ready for it_ as the Canaanites kept possession of the good land till the time appointed for Israel's entering upon it. ,20250223
He makes too light of Job's afflictions: __It touches thee.__ The very word that Satan himself had used_ ch. i. 11_ ii,20250223
He makes too much of Job's resentments_ and aggravates them: __Thou faintest_ or thou art beside thyself; thou ravest_ and knowest not what thou sayest.__ Men in deep distress must have grains of allowance_ and a favourable construction put upon what they say; when we make the worst of every word we do not as we would be done by.,20250223
He marketh all my paths; so he had said_ ch. xiii. 27.,20250223
He may be said to boast of a false gift,20250223
He may prepare it_ but the just shall put it on_ and the innocent shall divide the silver. 18 He buildeth his house as a moth_ and as a booth that the keeper maketh. 19 The rich man shall lie down_ but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes_ and he is not. 20 Terrors take hold on him as waters_ a tempest stealeth him away in the night. 21 The east wind carrieth him away_ and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. 22 For God shall cast upon him_ and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. 23 Men shall clap their hands at him_ and shall hiss him out of his place.,20250223
He mentions the north because his country (as ours) lay in the northern hemisphere; and the air is the empty place over which it is stretched out. See Ps. lxxxix,20250223
He must amend what was amiss in his own conversation_ else his prayers would be ineffectual (v. 14): __If iniquity be in thy hand (that is_ if there be any sin which thou dost yet live in the practice of) put it far away_ forsake it with detestation and a holy indignation_ stedfastly resolving not to return to it_ nor ever to have any thing more to do with it. Ezek. xviii. 31; Hos. xiv. 9; Isa. xxx,20250223
He must do good with his power_ his knowledge_ and interest_ must administer justice with care_ courage_ and compassion_ v. 8_ 9. ,20250223
He must do his utmost to reform his family too: __Let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles; let not thy house harbour or shelter any wicked persons_ any wicked practices_ or any wealth gotten by wickedness.__ He suspected that Job's great household had been ill-governed_ and that_ where there were many_ there were many wicked_ and the ruin of his family was the punishment of the wickedness of it; and therefore_ if he expected God should return to him_ he must reform what was amiss there_ and_ though wickedness might come into his tabernacles_ he must not suffer it to dwell there_ Ps. ci. 3_ &c.,20250223
He must especially look upon himself as obliged to be the patron of oppressed innocency. The inferior magistrates perhaps had not zeal and tenderness enough to plead the cause of the poor and needy; therefore the king himself must interpose_ and appear as an advocate_ ,20250223
He must himself die (Isa. li. 12) and can but kill our body_ Luke xii,20250223
He must himself take cognizance of the causes his subjects have depending in his courts_ and inspect what his judges and officers do_ that he may support those that do their duty_ and lay those aside that neglect it or are partial. ,20250223
He must leave them to those that would never have taken so much pains for them_ and will there by excuse himself from taking any pains. He that raised the estate did it by labouring in wisdom_ and knowledge_ and equity; but he that enjoys it and spends it (it may be) has not laboured therein (v. and_ more than that_ never will. The bee toils to maintain the drone. Nay_ it proves a snare to him: it is left him for his portion_ which he rests in_ and takes up with; and miserable he is in being put off with it for a portion. Whereas_ if an estate had not come to him thus easily_ who knows but he might have been both industrious and religious?,20250223
He must leave them. He could not at death take them away with him_ nor any share of them_ nor should he return any more to them (Job vii. nor would the remembrance of them do him any good_ Luke xvi,20250223
He must look up_ and stretch out his hands towards God_ that is_ must stir up himself to take hold on God_ must pray to him with earnestness and importunity_ striving in prayer_ and with expectation to receive mercy and grace from him. To give the hand to the Lord signifies to yield ourselves to him and to covenant with him_ 2 Chron. xxx,20250223
He must_ in all matters that come before him_ judge righteously_ and_ without fear of the face of man_ boldly pass sentence according to equity: Open thy mouth_ which denotes the liberty of speech that princes and judges ought to use in passing sentence. Some observe that only wise men open their mouths_ for fools have their mouths always open_ are full of words. ,20250223
He never compassed or imagined any unchaste design. He never laid wait at his neighbour's door_ to get an opportunity to debauch his wife in his absence_ when the good man was not at home_ Prov. vii,20250223
He never hasted to deceit. Those that deceive must be quick and sharp_ but Job's quickness and sharpness were never turned that way. He never made haste to be rich by deceit_ but always acted cautiously_ lest_ through inconsideration_ he should do an unjust thing. Note_ What we have in the world may be either used with comfort or lost with comfort if it was honestly obtained. ,20250223
He never so much as beheld the sun or the moon in their pomp and lustre with any other admiration of them than what led him to give all the glory of their brightness and usefulness to their Creator. Against spiritual as well as corporal adultery he made a covenant with his eyes; and this was his covenant_ that_ whenever he looked at the lights of heaven_ he should by faith look through them_ and beyond them_ to the Father of lights. ,20250223
He never walked with vanity (v. that is_ he never durst tell a lie to get a good bargain. It was never his way to banter_ or equivocate_ or make many words in his dealings. Some men's constant walk is a constant cheat. They either make what they have more than it is_ that they may be trusted_ or less than it is_ that nothing may be expected from them. But Job was a different man. His wealth was not acquired by vanity_ though now diminished_ Prov. xiii,20250223
He never wished a curse to his soul (curses to the soul are the worst of curses)_ never desired his death; he knew that_ if he did_ it would turn into sin to him. He was careful not to offend with his tongue (Ps.,20250223
He not only looks on them_ but he never looks off them: He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous. Though they may seem sometimes neglected and forgotten_ and that befals them which looks like an oversight of Providence_ yet tender careful eye of their heavenly Father never withdraws from them. If our eye be ever towards God in duty_ his eye will be ever upon us in mercy_ and_ when we are at the lowest_ will not overlook us.,20250223
He not only took care not to walk in a constant course and way of deceit_ but he did not so much as take one step out of the way of honesty. In every particular action and affair we must closely tie ourselves up to the rules of righteousness. ,20250223
He now discovered more than ever of the evil of that great sin which he himself had been guilty of_ the loving of many strange women_ 1 Kings xi. 1. This is that which he here most feelingly laments_ and in very pathetic expressions. ,20250223
He now discovered more than ever of the general corruption of man's nature. He traces up that stream to the fountain_ as his father had done before him_ on a like occasion (Ps. li. 5): Behold_ I was shapen in iniquity. ,20250223
He observes a very great variety in the ways of God's providence towards men_ even towards bad men_ ver. 22-26,20250223
He observes bad men: He sees gross wickedness also_ though committed ever so secretly and ever so artfully palliated and disguised. All the wickedness of the wicked is naked and open before the all-seeing eye of God: Will he not then consider it? Yes_ certainly he will_ and will reckon for it_ though for a time he seem to keep silence.,20250223
He observes vain men. Such all are (every man_ at his best estate_ is altogether vanity)_ and he considers it in his dealings with them. He knows what the projects and hopes of vain men are_ and can blast and defeat them_ the workings of their foolish fancies; he sits in heaven_ and laughs at them. He takes knowledge of the vanity of men (that is_ their little sins; so some) their vain thoughts and vain words_ and unsteadiness in that which is good.,20250223
He obviates the suspicion of his being delirious (v. 13): Is not my help in me? that is_ __Have I not the use of my reason_ with which_ I thank God_ I can help myself_ though you do not help me? Do you think wisdom is driven quite from me_ and that I am gone distracted? No_ I am not mad_ most noble Eliphaz_ but speak the words of truth and soberness.__ Note_ Those who have grace in them_ who have the evidence of it and have it in exercise_ have wisdom in them_ which will be their help in the worst of times. Sat lucis intus—They have light within.,20250223
He opens the heart_ as he opened Lydia's_ and so opens the ears. He takes away that which stopped the ear_ so that the conviction finds or forces its way; nay_ he works in the soul a submission to the regimen of conscience and a compliance with its rules_ for that follows upon God's opening the ear_ Isa. l,20250223
He orders them to go to Job_ and beg of him to offer their sacrifices_ and pray for them_ otherwise they should not be accepted. By this God designed_,20250223
He overthrows the ground of their severe censures of him_ by showing that the destruction of the wicked is reserved for the other world_ and that they often escape to the last in this world (v. 27_ to the end)_ and in this Job was clearly in the right.,20250223
He owns God's favour to man in general_ even when he complains of his own particular troubles. __What is man_ miserable man_ a poor_ mean_ weak creature_ that thou_ the great and glorious God_ shouldst deal with him as thou dost? What is man___,20250223
He owns and laments the instances of his folly in which he had exceeded_ as_ in wisdom_ he came short. Here is_,20250223
He owns himself ignorant of the divine counsels; and so we are all. God's judgments are a great deep_ which we cannot fathom_ much less find out the springs of. We see what God does_ but we neither know why he does it_ what he is aiming at_ nor what he will bring it to. These are things too wonderful for us_ out of our sight to discover_ out of our reach to alter_ and out of our jurisdiction to judge of. They are things which we know not; it is quite above our capacity to pass a verdict upon them. The reason why we quarrel with Providence is because we do not understand it; and we must be content to be in the dark about it_ until the mystery of God shall be finished,20250223
He owns himself imprudent and presumptuous in undertaking to discourse of that which he did not understand and to arraign that which he could not judge of. He that answereth a matter before he heareth it_ it is folly and shame to him. We wrong ourselves_ as well as the cause which we undertake to determine_ while we are no competent judges of it.,20250223
He owns himself in love with her_ v,20250223
He owns himself to be guilty of that which God had charged him with in the beginning of his discourse_ v,20250223
He owns himself unfit to enter into the lists with his seniors_ yet he desires they will not despise his youth_ for that he is God's workmanship as well as they_ made by the same hand_ endued with the same noble powers and faculties_ and designed for the same great end; and therefore why may not the God that made him make use of his as an instrument of good to Job? With this consideration also we should quicken ourselves (and perhaps Elihu made that use of it) to do good in our places according to our capacity. God has made us_ and given us life_ and therefore we should study to use our life to some good purpose_ to spend it in glorifying God and serving our generation according to his will_ that we may answer the end of our creation and it may not be said that we were made in vain,20250223
He owns that he had spoken of him the thing that was right_ beyond what his antagonists had done. He had given a much better and truer account of the divine Providence than they had done. They had wronged God by making prosperity a mark of the true church and affliction a certain indication of God's wrath; but Job had done him right by maintaining that God's love and hatred are to be judged of by what is in men_ not by what is before them_ Eccl. ix. 1. Observe_ First_ Those do the most justice to God and his providence who have an eye to the rewards and punishments of another world more than to those of this_ and with the prospect of those solve the difficulties of the present administration. Job had referred things to the future judgment_ and the future state_ more than his friends had done_ and therefore he spoke of God that which was right_ better than his friends had done. Secondly_ Though Job had spoken some things amiss_ even concerning God_ whom he made too bold with_ yet he is commended for what he spoke that was right. We must not only not reject that which is true and good_ but must not deny it its due praise_ though there appear in it a mixture of human frailty and infirmity. Thirdly_ Job was in the right_ and his friends were in the wrong_ and yet he was in pain and they were at ease—a plain evidence that we cannot judge of men and their sentiments by looking in their faces or purses. He only can do it infallibly who sees men's hearts. ,20250223
He owns that men may be either bettered or damaged by what we do (v. 8): Thy wickedness_ perhaps_ may hurt a man as thou art_ may occasion him trouble in his outward concerns. A wicked man may wound_ or rob_ or slander his neighbour_ or may draw him into sin and so prejudice his soul. Thy righteousness_ thy justice_ thy charity_ thy wisdom_ thy piety_ may perhaps profit the son of man. Our goodness extends to the saints that are in the earth_ Ps. xvi,20250223
He passionately applauds death and the grave_ and seems quite in love with them. To desire to die that we may be with Christ_ that we may be free from sin_ and that we may be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven_ is the effect and evidence of grace; but to desire to die only that we may be quiet in the grave_ and delivered from the troubles of this life_ savours of corruption. Job's considerations here may be of good use to reconcile us to death when it comes_ and to make us easy under the arrest of it; but they ought not to be made use of as a pretence to quarrel with life while it is continued_ or to make us uneasy under the burdens of it. It is our wisdom and duty to make the best of that which is_ be it living or dying_ and so to live to the Lord and die to the Lord_ and to be his in both_ Rom. xiv,20250223
He passionately complains of the miserable condition he was now in_ ver. 11-16,20250223
He perceived that Job had no opinion of their abilities_ but thought they knew little. __We will own___ says Bildad_ __that we know nothing_ are as ready to confess our ignorance as thou art to condemn it; for we are but of yesterday in comparison_ and our days upon earth are short and transient_ and hastening away as a shadow. And hence___ ,20250223
He persuades him to humble himself before God and to take shame to himself_ ver. 14-16.,20250223
He pleads the final period which death puts to our present state_ ver. 7-10,20250223
He prays against the extremes of abundance and want: Give me neither poverty nor riches. He does not hereby prescribe to God_ nor pretend to teach him what condition he shall allot to him_ nor does he pray against poverty or riches absolutely_ as in themselves evil_ for either of them_ by the grace of God_ may be sanctified and be a means of good to us; but_ First_ He hereby intends to express the value which wise and good men have for a middle state of life_ and_ with submission to the will of God_ desires that that might be his state_ neither great honour nor great contempt. We must learn how to manage both (as St. Paul_ Phil. iv. but rather wish to be always between both. Optimus pecuniæ modus qui nec in paupertatem cedit nec procul à paupertate discedit—The best condition is that which neither implies poverty nor yet recedes far from it. Seneca. Secondly_ He hereby intimates a holy jealousy he had of himself_ that he could not keep his ground against the temptations either of an afflicted or a prosperous condition. Others may preserve their integrity in either_ but he is afraid of both_ and therefore grace teaches him to pray against riches as much as nature against poverty; but the will of the Lord be done. ,20250223
He prays that he may be kept from every condition of life that would be a temptation to him. ,20250223
He prays that of God's free gift he might receive a competent portion of the good things of this life: __Feed me with the bread of my allowance_ such bread as thou thinkest fit to allow me.__ As to all the gifts of the divine Providence_ we must refer ourselves to the divine wisdom. Or_ __the bread that is fit for me_ as a man_ a master of a family_ that which is agreeable to my rank and condition in the world.__ For as is the man so is his competency. Our Saviour seems to refer to this when he teaches us to pray_ Give us this day our daily bread_ as this seems to refer to Jacob's vow_ in which he wished for no more than bread to eat and raiment to put on. Food convenient for us is what we ought to be content with_ though we have not dainties_ varieties_ and superfluities—what is for necessity_ though we have not for delight and ornament; and it is what we may in faith pray for and depend upon God for. ,20250223
He prefers the condition of a still-born child before the condition of such a one_ ver,20250223
He preserves to us the use of our reason and understanding,20250223
He proceeds in divers particular instances and proofs of Job's utter inability to contend with God_ because of his ignorance and weakness: for,20250223
He professes his love to her and his delight in her affection to him_ ver. 9-14.,20250223
He promises himself effectual relief_ and the redress of all his grievances_ by the stroke of death (v. 10): __Then should I yet have comfort_ which now I have not_ nor ever expect till then.__ See,20250223
He promises not to offend any more as he had done; for Elihu had told him that this was meet to be said unto God. When we have spoken amiss we must repent of it and not repeat it nor stand to it. He enjoins himself silence (v. 4): __I will lay my hand upon my mouth_ will keep that as with a bridle_ to suppress all passionate thoughts which may arise in my mind_ and keep them from breaking out in intemperate speeches.__ It is bad to think amiss_ but it is much worse to speak amiss_ for that is an allowance of the evil thought and gives it an imprimatur—a sanction; it is publishing the seditious libel; and therefore_ if thou hast thought evil_ lay thy hand upon thy mouth and let it go no further (Prov. xxx. 32) and that will be an evidence for thee that that which thou thoughtest thou allowest not. Job had suffered his evil thoughts to vent themselves: __Once have I spoken amiss_ yea_ twice___ that is_ __divers times_ in one discourse and in another; but,20250223
He protests that he never gave the worship and glory to the creature which are due to God only; he was never guilty of idolatry_ v. 26-28. We do not find that Job's friends charged him with this. But there were those_ it seems_ at that time_ who were so sottish as to worship the sun and moon_ else Job would not have mentioned it. Idolatry is one of the old ways which wicked men have trodden_ and the most ancient idolatry was the worshipping of the sun and moon_ to which the temptation was most strong_ as appears Deut. iv. 19_ where Moses speaks of the danger which the people were in of being driven to worship them. But as yet it was practised secretly_ and durst not appear in open view_ as afterwards the most abominable idolatries did. Observe_,20250223
He protests that he was so far from doing or designing mischief to any that he neither desired nor delighted in the hurt of the worst enemy he had. The forgiving of those that do us evil_ it seems_ was Old-Testament duty_ though the Pharisees made the law concerning it of no effect_ by teaching_ Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thy enemy_ Matt. v,20250223
He proves it by divers instances of the benefit of friendship and good conversation. ,20250223
He proves it by showing what a God he is with whom we have to do: He is wise in heart_ and therefore we cannot answer him at law; he is mighty in strength_ and therefore we cannot fight it out with him. It is the greatest madness that can be to think to contend with a God of infinite wisdom and power_ who knows every thing and can do every thing_ who can be neither outwitted nor overpowered. The devil promised himself that Job_ in the day of his affliction_ would curse God and speak ill of him_ but_ instead of that_ he sets himself to honour God and to speak highly of him. As much pained as he is_ and as much taken up with his own miseries_ when he has occasion to mention the wisdom and power of God he forgets his complaints_ dwells with delight_ and expatiates with a flood of eloquence_ upon that noble useful subject. Evidences of the wisdom and power of God he fetches_,20250223
He proves the misery of his condition by many instances—that he should have a diseased body_ a troubled conscience_ a ruined estate_ a beggared family_ an infamous name and that he himself should perish under the weight of divine wrath: all this is most curiously described here in lofty expressions and lively similitudes; and it often proves true in this world_ and always in another_ without repentance_ ver. 10-29. But the great mistake was_ and (as bishop Patrick expresses it) all the flaw in his discourse (which was common to him with the rest)_ that he imagined God never varied from this method_ and therefore Job was_ without doubt_ a very bad man_ though it did not appear that he was_ any other way than by his infelicity.,20250223
He provided food convenient for them; they ate of the same morsels that he did (v. did not eat after him_ of the crumbs that fell from his table_ but with him_ of the best dish upon his table. Those that have abundance must not eat their morsels alone_ as if they had none but themselves to take care of_ nor indulge their appetite with a dainty bit by themselves_ but take others to share with them_ as David took Mephibosheth. ,20250223
He provides for our inward comfort and joy under our outward troubles_ and we ought to make use of that_ and wait his time for the removal of our troubles: He gives songs in the night_ that is_ when our condition is ever so dark_ and sad_ and melancholy_ there is that in God_ in his providence and promise_ which is sufficient_ not only to support us_ but to fill us with joy and consolation_ and enable us in every thing to give thanks_ and even to rejoice in tribulation. When we only pore upon the afflictions we are under_ and neglect the consolations of God which are treasured up for us_ it is just with God to reject our prayers. ,20250223
He put Job in hope that_ if he were indeed upright_ as he said he was_ he should yet see a good issue of his present troubles: __Although thy children have sinned against him_ and are cast away in their transgression (they have died in their own sin)_ yet if thou be pure and upright thyself_ and as an evidence of that wilt now seek unto God and submit to him_ all shall be well yet___ v. 5-7. This may be taken two ways_ either,20250223
He put a respect upon the poor_ and did them honour; for he took the fatherless children to eat with him at his own table: they should fare as he fared_ and be familiar with him_ and he would show himself pleased with their company as if they had been his own_ v,20250223
He puts no trust in them_ did not repose a confidence in them_ as we do in those we cannot live without. There is no service in which he employs them but_ if he pleased_ he could have it done as well without them. He never made them his confidants_ or of his cabinet-council_ Matt. xxiv,20250223
He puts this desire into a prayer_ that God would grant him this request_ that it would please God to do this for him. It was his sin so passionately to desire the hastening of his own death_ and offering up that desire to God made it no better; nay_ what looked ill in his wish looked worse in his prayer_ for we ought not to ask any thing of God but what we can ask in faith_ and we cannot ask any thing in faith but what is agreeable to the will of God. Passionate prayers are the worst of passionate expressions_ for we should lift up pure hands without wrath.,20250223
He reads him a long lecture concerning the woeful estate of wicked people_ who harden their hearts against God and the judgments which are prepared for them_ ver. 17-35. A good use may be made both of his reproofs (for they are plain) and of his doctrine (for it is sound)_ though both the one and the other are misapplied to Job.,20250223
He reasons with him concerning his discontent and uneasiness under his affliction_ v,20250223
He received a little thereof_ v,20250223
He reckoned it a great instance of God's favour to any man if by his grace he has kept him from this sin: He that pleases God shall escape from her_ shall be preserved either from being tempted to this sin or from being overcome by the temptation. Those that are kept from this sin must acknowledge it is God that keeps them_ and not any strength or resolution of their own_ must acknowledge it a great mercy; and those that would have grace sufficient for them to arm them against this sin must be careful to please God in every thing_ by keeping his ordinances_ Lev.,20250223
He reckoned it a sin that is as sore a punishment of other sins as a man can fall under in this life: The sinner shall be taken by her. First_ Those that allow themselves in other sins_ by which their minds are blinded and their consciences debauched_ are the more easily drawn to this. Secondly_ it is just with God to leave them to themselves to fall into it. See Rom. i. 26_ 28; Eph. iv. 18_ 19. Thus does Solomon_ as it were_ with horror_ bless himself from the sin in which he had plunged himself.,20250223
He reckons himself honoured in the kindnesses that are done them; he takes them as done to himself_ and will show himself accordingly pleased with them. I was hungry_ and you gave me meat. Those therefore that have any true honour for God will show it by compassion to the poor_ whom he has undertaken in a special manner to protect and patronise.,20250223
He recommends to him his Bible and his catechism_ as the means_ his father's words (v.,20250223
He recommends to him wisdom and understanding as the end to be aimed at in the use of these means; that wisdom which is the principal wisdom_ get that. Quod caput est sapientia eam acquire sapientiam—Be sure to mind that branch of wisdom which is the top branch of it_ and that is the fear of God_ ch. i,20250223
He recommends to us some good means proper to be used for the redress of these grievances and the arming of ourselves against the mischief we are in danger of from them_ that we may make the best of the bad_ as 1. Care of our reputation_ ver. 1,20250223
He recommends what he had written upon this subject by divine direction and inspiration to our serious consideration. The words of this book are faithful_ and well worthy our acceptance_ for_,20250223
He recommends wisdom to private persons_ who are in an inferior station. 1. It is our wisdom to preserve our reputation_ in managing our affairs dexterously_ ver. 1-3,20250223
He recommends wisdom to rulers; let them not think that_ because their subjects must be quiet under them_ therefore they may do what they please; no_ but,20250223
He reconciles this to the holiness and justice of God. Though wicked people prosper thus all their days_ yet we are not therefore to think that God will let their wickedness always go unpunished. No,20250223
He reconsiders the pretensions of wisdom_ and allows it to be excellent and useful_ and yet sees it clogged with such diminutions of its worth that it proves insufficient to make a man happy_ ver. 12-16.,20250223
He reflects upon his friends for their severe censures of his complaints and their unskilful management of his case. 1. Their reproofs were causeless. He complained_ it is true_ now that he was in this affliction_ but he never used to complain_ as those do who are of a fretful unquiet spirit_ when he was in prosperity: he did not bray when he had grass_ nor low over his fodder_ v,20250223
He reflects upon the vain hopes they had fed him with_ that he should yet see good days_ showing that his days were just at an end_ and with his body all his hopes would be buried in the dust_ ver. 10-16. His friends becoming strange to him_ which greatly grieved him_ he makes death and the grave familiar to him_ which yielded him some comfort.,20250223
He reflects with comfort upon the concern he always had for the calamities of others when he was himself at ease (v. 25): Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Some think he herein complains of God_ thinking it very hard that he who had shown mercy to others should not himself find mercy. I would rather take it as a quieting consideration to himself; his conscience witnessed for him that he had always sympathized with persons in misery and done what he could to help them_ and therefore he had reason to expect that_ at length_ both God and his friends would pity him. Those who mourn with them that mourn will bear their own sorrows the better when it comes to their turn to drink of the bitter cup. Did not my soul burn for the poor? so some read it_ comparing it with that of St. Paul_ 2 Cor. xi. 29_ Who is offended_ and I burn not? As those who have been unmerciful and hard-hearted to others may expect to hear of it from their own consciences_ when they are themselves in trouble_ so those who have considered the poor and succoured them shall have the remembrance thereof to make their bed easy in their sickness_ Ps. xli. 1_ 3.,20250223
He remembers how Job had comforted others as a reason why he might justly expect to be himself comforted; and yet_ if conviction was necessary in order to comfort_ they must be excused if they applied themselves to that first. The Comforter shall reprove_ John xvi,20250223
He reminds him that trouble and affliction are what we have all reason to expect in this world: Man is brought to trouble (v. not as man (had he kept his innocency he would have been born to pleasure)_ but as sinful man_ as born of a woman (ch. xiv. 1)_ who was in the transgression. Man is born in sin_ and therefore born to trouble. Even those that are born to honour and estate are yet born to trouble in the flesh. In our fallen state it has become natural to us to sin_ and the natural consequence of that is affliction_ Rom. v,20250223
He reminds young people of this: Childhood and youth are vanity. The dispositions and actions of childhood and youth have in them a great deal of impertinence and iniquity_ sinful vanity_ which young people have need to watch against and get cured. The pleasures and advantages of childhood and youth have in them no certainty_ satisfaction_ nor continuance. They are passing away; these flowers will soon wither_ and these blossoms fall; let them therefore be knit into good fruit_ which will continue and abound to a good account.,20250223
He repeats the caution he had before given against envying the pleasures and successes of wicked man in their wicked ways. This he quotes from his father David_ Ps. xxxvii. 1. We must not in any case fret ourselves_ or make ourselves uneasy_ whatever God does in his providence how disagreeable soever it is to our sentiments_ interests_ and expectations_ we must acquiesce in it. Even that which grieves us must not fret us; nor must our eye be evil against any because God is good. Are we more wise or just than he? If wicked people prosper_ we must not therefore incline to do as they do,20250223
He repeats_ almost word for word_ part of the description he had given of her beauty (ch.,20250223
He represents God_ the author of them_ as infinite and unsearchable_ v,20250223
He represents his own case as very deplorable upon all accounts_ ver. 6-16.,20250223
He represents the unkindness of their conduct towards him_ by showing what he could do to them if they were in his condition: I could speak as you do. It is an easy thing to trample upon those that are down_ and to find fault with what those say that are in extremity of pain and affliction: __I could heap up words against you_ as you do against me; and how would you like it? how would you bear it?__ ,20250223
He represents this as a slight put upon divine consolations in general_ as if they were of small account with him_ whereas really they were not. If he had not highly valued them_ he could not have borne up as he did under his sufferings. Note_ ,20250223
He reproves him for justifying himself_ and fathers on him many evil things which are unfairly inferred thence_ ver. 2-13.,20250223
He reproves his friends for their uncharitable censures of him and their unkind treatment_ ver. 14-30. It must be owned that Job_ in all this_ spoke much that was reasonable_ but with a mixture of passion and human infirmity. And in this contest_ as indeed in most contests_ there was fault on both sides.,20250223
He required his children to attend the sacrifice_ that they might join with him in the prayers he offered with the sacrifice_ that the sight of the killing of the sacrifice might humble them much for their sins_ for which they deserved to die_ and the sight of the offering of it up might lead them to a Mediator. This serious work would help to make them serious again after the days of their gaiety.,20250223
He requires from them a sacrifice_ to make atonement for what they had said amiss. They must bring each of them seven bullocks_ and each of them seven rams_ to be offered up to God for a burnt-offering; for it should seem that_ before the law of Moses_ all sacrifices_ even those of atonement_ were wholly burnt_ and therefore were so called. They thought they had spoken wonderfully well_ and that God was beholden to them for pleading his cause and owed them a good reward for it; but they are told that_ on the contrary_ he is displeased with them_ requires from them a sacrifice_ and threatens that_ otherwise_ he will deal with them after their folly. God is often angry at that in us which we are ourselves proud of and sees much amiss in that which we think was done well. ,20250223
He resolved to spare no pains (v. 25): __I applied my heart; I and my heart turned every way; I left no stone unturned_ no means untried_ to compass what I had in view. I set myself to know_ and to search_ and to seek out wisdom_ to accomplish myself in all useful learning_ philosophy_ and divinity.__ If he had not thus closely applied himself to study_ it would have been but a jest for him to say_ I will be wise_ for those that will attain the end must take the right way. Solomon was a man of great quickness_ and yet_ instead of using that (with many) as an excuse for slothfulness_ he pressed it upon himself as an inducement to diligence_ and the easier he found it to master a good notion the more intent he would be that he might be master of the more good notions. Those that have the best parts should take the greatest pains_ as those that have the largest stock should trade most. He applied himself not only to know what lay on the surface_ but to search what lay hidden out of the common view and road; nor did he search a little way_ and then give it over because he did not presently find what he searched for_ but he sought it out_ went to the bottom of it; nor did he aim to know things only_ but the reasons of things_ that he might give an account of them.,20250223
He resolved_ if it were possible_ to gain his point: I said_ I will be wise. He earnestly desired it as highly valuable; he fully designed it as that which he looked upon to be attainable; he determined not to sit down short of it_ Prov. xviii. 1. Many are not wise because they never said they would be so_ being indifferent to it; but Solomon set it up for the mark he aimed at. When he made trial of sensual pleasures_ he still thought to acquaint his heart with wisdom (ch. and not to be diverted from the pursuits of that; but perhaps he did not find it so easy a thing as he imagined to keep up his correspondence with wisdom_ while he addicted himself so much to his pleasures. However_ his will was good; he said_ I will be wise. And that was not all: ,20250223
He resolves all into the absolute propriety which God has in all the creatures (v. 10): In whose hand is the soul of every living thing. All the creatures_ and mankind particularly_ derive their being from him_ owe their being to him_ depend upon him for the support of it_ lie at his mercy_ are under his direction and dominion and entirely at his disposal_ and at his summons must resign their lives. All souls are his; and may he not do what he will with his own? The name Jehovah is used here (v. and it is the only time that we meet with it in all the discourses between Job and his friends; for God was_ in that age_ more known by the name of Shaddai—the Almighty.,20250223
He resolves this difference which Providence makes between one wicked man and another into the wisdom and sovereignty of God (v. 22): Shall any pretend to teach God knowledge? Dare we arraign God's proceedings or blame his conduct? Shall we take upon us to tell God how he should govern the world_ what sinner he should spare and whom he should punish? He has both authority and ability to judge those that are high. Angels in heaven_ princes and magistrates on earth_ are accountable to God_ and must receive their doom from him. He manages them_ and makes what use he pleases of them. Shall he then be accountable to us_ or receive advice from us? He is the Judge of all the earth_ and therefore no doubt he will do right (Gen. xviii. 25_ Rom. iii. and those proceedings of his providence which seem to contradict one another he can make_ not only mutually to agree_ but jointly to serve his own purposes. The little difference there is between one wicked man's dying so in pain and misery_ when both will at last meet in hell_ he illustrates by the little difference there is between one man's dying suddenly and another's dying slowly_ when they will both meet shortly in the grave. So vast is the disproportion between time and eternity that_ if hell be the lot of every sinner at last_ it makes little difference if one goes singing thither and another sighing. See_,20250223
He resolves to adhere to the testimony his own conscience gave of his integrity; and though his friends called it obstinacy that should not shake his constancy: __I will speak in my own defence_ and let come on me what will_ v,20250223
He retires himself_ and invites her with him_ from the mountains of terror to those of delight_ ver. 6_ 8.,20250223
He rose early_ as one in care that his children might not lie long under guilt and as one whose heart was upon his work and his desire towards it. ,20250223
He satisfies himself with this_ that God himself was a witness to his integrity_ and therefore did not doubt but the issue would be good.,20250223
He saw all his hopes from this world dropping into the grave with him (v. 15_ 16): __Seeing I must shortly leave the world_ where is now my hope? How can I expect to prosper who do not expect to live?__ He is not hopeless_ but his hope is not where they would have it be. If in this life only he had hope_ he was of all men most miserable. __No_ as for my hope_ that hope which I comfort and support myself with_ who shall see it? It is something out of sight that I hope for_ not things that are seen_ that are temporal_ but things not seen_ that are eternal.__ What is his hope he will tell us (ch. xix.,20250223
He saw himself just dropping into the grave. A convenient house_ an easy bed_ and agreeable relations_ are some of those things in which we take satisfaction in this world: Job expected not any of these above ground; all he felt_ and all he had in view_ was unpleasing and disagreeable_ but under ground he expected them. ,20250223
He saw no way open of deliverance_ nor knew he what course to take; his way was hedged up with thorns_ that he could not find his path. See ch. xxiii. 8; Lam. iii. 7.,20250223
He saw wicked men to whom it happened according to the work of the righteous_ who prospered as remarkably as if they had been rewarded for some good deed_ and that from themselves_ from God_ from men. We see the just troubled and perplexed in their own minds_ the wicked easy_ fearless_ and secure_—the just crossed and afflicted by the divine Providence_ the wicked prosperous_ successful_ and smiled upon_—the just_ censured_ reproached_ and run down_ by the higher powers_ the wicked applauded and preferred.,20250223
He saw_ at length_ what he had foreseen. He was not disappointed in his expectation concerning him; the event answered it; his family was undone_ and his estate ruined. In these particulars he plainly and very invidiously reflects on Job's calamities. ,20250223
He scatters terror with his very breath and looks; if he sneeze or spout up water_ it is like a light shining_ either with the froth or the light of the sun shining through it_ v.,20250223
He seems to prefer money before mirth: A feast is made for laughter_ not merely for eating_ but chiefly for pleasant conversation and the society of friends_ not the laughter of the fool_ which is madness_ but that of wise men_ by which they fit themselves for business and severe studies. Spiritual feasts are made for spiritual laughter_ holy joy in God. Wine makes merry_ makes glad the life_ but money is the measure of all things and answers all things. Pecuniæ obediunt omnia—Money commands all things. Though wine make merry_ it will not be a house for us_ nor a bed_ nor clothing_ nor provisions and portions for children; but money_ if men have enough of it_ will be all these. The feast cannot be made without money_ and_ though men have wine_ they are not so much disposed to be merry unless they have money for the necessary supports of life. Money of itself answers nothing; it will neither feed nor clothe; but_ as it is the instrument of commerce_ it answers all the occasions of this present life. What is to be had may be had for money. But it answers nothing to the soul; it will not procure the pardon of sin_ the favour of God_ the peace of conscience; the soul_ as it is not redeemed_ so it is not maintained_ with corruptible things as silver and gold. Some refer this to rulers; it is ill with the people when they give up themselves to luxury and riot_ feasting and making merry_ not only because their business is neglected_ but because money must be had to answer all these things_ and_ in order to that_ the people squeezed by heavy taxes.,20250223
He sees his ruin approaching: Destruction shall be ready at his side_ to seize him whenever justice gives the word_ so that he is brought into desolation in a moment_ Ps. lxxiii. 19,20250223
He sees it. The ways of man_ all his motions_ all his actions_ are before the eyes of the Lord_ all the workings of the heart and all the outgoings of the life_ that which is done ever so secretly and disguised ever so artfully. God sees it in a true light_ and knows it with all its causes_ circumstances_ and consequences. He does not cast an eye upon men's ways now and then_ but they are always actually in his view and under his inspection; and darest thou sin against God in his sight_ and do that wickedness under his eye which thou durst not do in the presence of a man like thyself? 2. He will call the sinner to an account for it; for he not only sees_ but ponders all his goings_ judges concerning them_ as one that will shortly judge the sinner for them. Every action is weighed_ and shall be brought into judgment (Eccl. xii. which is a good reason why we should ponder the path of our feet (ch. iv. and so judge ourselves that we may not be judged.,20250223
He seriously enquires how he may make his peace with God: __What shall I do unto thee_ having done so much against thee?__ Are we convinced that we have sinned_ and are we brought to own it? We cannot but conclude that something must be done to prevent the fatal consequences of it. The matter must not rest as it is_ but some course must be taken to undo what has been ill done. And_ if we are truly sensible of the danger we have run ourselves into_ we shall be willing to do any thing_ to take a pardon upon any terms; and therefore shall be inquisitive as to what we shall do (Mic. vi. 6_ what we shall do to God_ not to satisfy the demands of his justice (that is done only by the Mediator)_ but to qualify ourselves for the tokens of his favour_ according to the tenour of the gospel-covenant. In making this enquiry it is good to eye God as the preserver or Saviour of men_ not their destroyer. In our repentance we must keep up good thoughts of God_ as one that delights not in the ruin of his creatures_ but would rather they should return and live. __Thou art the Saviour of men; be my Saviour_ for I cast myself upon thy mercy.__ ,20250223
He sets bounds to the waters of the sea_ and compasses them in (v. that they may not return to cover the earth; and these bounds shall continue unmoved_ unshaken_ unworn_ till the day and night come to an end_ when time shall be no more. Herein appears the dominion which Providence has over the raging waters of the sea_ and so it is an instance of his power_ Jer.,20250223
He settled the course of nature. Job mentions particularly a decree for the rain and a way for the thunder and lightning. The general manner and method_ and the particular uses and tendencies_ of these strange performances_ both their causes and their effects_ were appointed by the divine purpose; hence God is said to prepare lightnings for the rain_ Ps. cxxxv. 7; Jer. x,20250223
He shall be happy in everlasting life and joy: His life shall see the light_ that is_ all good_ in the vision and fruition of God. To obtain this bliss_ if the prophet had bidden us do some great thing_ would we not have done it? How much more when he only says unto us_ Wash and be clean_ confess and be pardoned_ repent and be saved?,20250223
He shall be stripped of all he has and become a beggar. He that spoiled others shall himself be spoiled (Isa. xxxiii. 1); for every hand of the wicked shall be upon him. The innocent_ whom he has wronged_ sit down by their loss_ saying_ as David_ Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked_ but my hand shall not be upon him_ 1 Sam. xxiv,20250223
He shall be thy gold; so it is in the margin_ and it is the same word that is used (v. 24) for gold_ but it signifies also a strong-hold_ because money is a defence_ Eccl. vii,20250223
He shall fly away upon the wings of his own terrors_ and be chased away by the just imprecations of all about him_ who would gladly get rid of him. ,20250223
He shall have none. Those are not to be envied that have their portion in this life and must out-live it_ Ps. xvii,20250223
He shall lie down in sorrow.,20250223
He shall not come into condemnation_ but be saved from the wrath to come: He shall deliver his soul from going into the pit_ the pit of hell; iniquity shall not be his ruin. ,20250223
He shall not only never rejoice truly_ but not long rejoice at all.,20250223
He shall reap the same_ that is_ the proper product of that seedness. That which the sinner sows_ he sows not that body that shall be_ but God will give it a body_ a body of death_ the end of those things_ Rom. vi.,20250223
He sharply reproves Job as haughty and passionate_ and obstinate in his opinion_ ver. 1-4.,20250223
He should have it more sure to him: __Thou shalt lay it up in good hands_ and hold that which is got by thy piety by a surer tenure than that which thou didst get by thy iniquity.__ Thou shalt have silver of strength (for so the word is)_ which_ being honestly got_ will wear well—silver like steel. ,20250223
He should have more wealth than ever he had_ not only thousands of sheep and oxen_ the wealth of farmers_ but thousands of gold and silver_ the wealth of princes_ ch. iii,20250223
He should_ by the grace of God_ be kept from setting his heart so much upon it as Eliphaz thought he had done; and then wealth is a blessing indeed when we are not ensnared with the love of it. Thou shalt lay up gold; but how? Not as thy treasure and portion_ but as dust_ and as the stones of the brooks. So little shalt thou value it or expect from it that thou shalt lay it at thy feet (Acts iv. not in thy bosom.,20250223
He shows how dark and defective even the heavenly bodies are in the sight of God_ and in comparison with him_ and thence infers how little_ and mean_ and worthless_ man is. 1. The lights of heaven_ though beauteous creatures_ are before God as clods of earth (v. 5): Behold even to the moon_ walking in brightness_ and the stars_ those glorious lamps of heaven_ which the heathen were so charmed with the lustre of that they worshipped them—yet_ in God's sight_ in comparison with him_ they shine not_ they are not pure; they have no glory_ by reason of the glory which excelleth_ as a candle_ though it burn_ yet does not shine when it is set in the clear light of the sun. The glory of God_ shining in his providences_ eclipses the glory of the brightest creatures_ Isa. xxiv,20250223
He shows how great a change death will make with us_ which will be either the prevention or the period of the miseries of old age. Nothing else will keep them off_ nor any thing else cure them. __Therefore remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth_ because death is certainly before thee_ perhaps it is very near thee_ and it is a serious thing to die_ and thou shouldst feel concerned with the utmost care and diligence to prepare for it.__ ,20250223
He shows how they abuse their prosperity and are confirmed and hardened by it in their impiety_ v. 14_ 15.,20250223
He shows how wretchedly he was disappointed in his expectations from them (v. 15): __My brethren_ who should have helped me_ have dealt deceitfully as a brook.__ They came by appointment_ with a great deal of ceremony_ to mourn with him and to comfort him (ch. ii. 11); and some extraordinary things were expected from such wise_ learned_ knowing men_ and Job's particular friends. None questioned but that the drift of their discourses would be to comfort Job with the remembrance of his former piety_ the assurance of God's favour to him_ and the prospect of a glorious issue; but_ instead of this_ they most barbarously fall upon him with their reproaches and censures_ condemn him as a hypocrite_ insult over his calamities_ and pour vinegar_ instead of oil_ into his wounds_ and thus they deal deceitfully with him. Note_ It is fraud and deceit not only to violate our engagements to our friends_ but to frustrate their just expectations from us_ especially the expectations we have raised. Note_ further_ It is our wisdom to cease from man. We cannot expect too little from the creature nor too much from the Creator. It is no new thing even for brethren to deal deceitfully (Jer. ix. 4_ 5; Mic. vii. 5); let us therefore put our confidence in the rock of ages_ not in broken reeds-in the fountain of life_ not in broken cisterns. God will out-do our hopes as much as men come short of them. This disappointment which Job met with he here illustrates by the failing of brooks in summer.,20250223
He shows that Bildad's discourse was foreign to the matter he was discoursing of—though very true and good_ yet not to the purpose_ ver. 2-4.,20250223
He shows that he had just cause to complain as he did of his troubles_ and so it would appear to any impartial judge_ ver. 2-7.,20250223
He shows that there is no true happiness and satisfaction to be had in mirth and pleasure_ and the delights of sense_ ver. 1-11.,20250223
He shows that these daring sinners prosper_ and are at ease for a while_ nay_ and often end their days in peace_ as Ishmael_ who_ though he was a man of such a character as is here given_ yet both lived and died in the presence of all his brethren_ as we are told_ Gen. xvi. 12; xxv. 18: Of these sinners here it is said,20250223
He shows the many pernicious consequences of the sin of drunkenness_ for the enforcement of this caution. Take heed of the bait_ for fear of the hook: At the last it bites_ v,20250223
He shows the miserable end of wicked people_ notwithstanding their long prosperity_ and the curse that attends them and is entailed upon their families_ ver. 11-23.,20250223
He shows the perniciousness of these ways_ as a reason why we should dread them (v. 15): __My son_ walk not thou in the way with them; do not associate with them; get_ and keep_ as far off from them as thou canst; refrain thy foot from their path; do not take example by them_ not do as they do.__ Such is the corruption of our nature that our foot is very prone to step into the path of sin_ so that we must use necessary violence upon ourselves to refrain our foot from it_ and check ourselves if at any time we take the least step towards it. Consider,20250223
He shows the vanity of riches as pertaining only to the body_ and giving no satisfaction to the mind (ver. 7_ and of those boundless desires with which covetous people vex themselves (ver. which_ if they be gratified ever so fully_ leave a man but a man still_ ver.,20250223
He shows their folly herein_ and utterly disclaims all concurrence with them (v. 19): Lo_ their good is not in their hand_ that is_ they did not get it without God_ and therefore they are very ungrateful to slight him thus. It was not their might_ nor the power of their hand_ that got them this wealth_ and therefore they ought to remember God who gave it them. Nor can they keep it without God_ and therefore they are very unwise to lose their interest in him and bid him to depart from them. Some give this sense of it: __Their good is in their barns and their bags_ hoarded up there; it is not in their hand_ to do good to others with it; and then what good does it do them?__ __Therefore___ says Job_ __the counsel of the wicked is far from me. Far be it from me that I should be of their mind_ say as they say_ do as they do_ and take my measures from them. Their posterity approve their sayings_ though their way be their folly ( Ps. xlix. 13); but I know better things than to walk in their counsel.__,20250223
He shows their great impiety_ in which they are hardened by their prosperity_ ver. 14-16,20250223
He shows them of what unspeakable advantage it would be to them. 1. It would preserve them from the snares of evil men (ver. 10-15) and of evil women_ ver. 16-19,20250223
He shows them that_ if they would diligently use the means of knowledge and grace_ they should obtain of God the knowledge and grace which they seek_ ver. 1-9.,20250223
He shows them what they should do_ by telling them what in that case he would do (v. 5): __I would strengthen you_ and say all I could to assuage your grief_ but nothing to aggravate it.__ It is natural to sufferers to think what they would do if the tables were turned. But perhaps our hearts may deceive us; we know not what we should do. We find it easier to discern the reasonableness and importance of a command when we have occasion to claim the benefit of it than when we have occasion to do the duty of it. See what is the duty we owe to our brethren in their affliction. ,20250223
He soon found himself at a loss_ and perceived that they were innumerable (v. 28): __Which yet my soul seeks; I am still counting_ and still desirous to find out the account_ but I find not_ I cannot count them all_ nor find out the account of them to perfection. I still make new and amazing discoveries of the desperate wickedness that there is in my own heart___ Jer. xvii. 9_ 10. Who can know it? Who can understand his errors? Who can tell how often he offends? Ps. xix,20250223
He soon gave her an answer (for Satan spared him the use of his tongue_ in hopes he would curse God with it)_ which showed his constant resolution to cleave to God_ to keep his good thoughts of him_ and not to let go his integrity. See_,20250223
He speaks concisely_ and in haste_ because_ it should seem_ he perceived that God was about to take the work into his own hands. 1. He observes that God who has said that he will dwell in the thick darkness and make that his pavilion (2 Chron. vi. 1_ Ps. xviii. 11) is in that awful chariot advancing towards them_ as if he were preparing his throne for judgment_ surrounded with clouds and darkness_ Ps. xcvii. 2_ 9. He saw the cloud_ with a whirlwind in the bosom of it_ coming out of the south; but now it hung so thick_ so black_ over their heads_ that they could none of them see the bright light which just before was in the clouds. The light of the sun was now eclipsed. This reminded him of the darkness by reason of which he could not speak (v. and made him afraid to go on_,20250223
He speaks highly of God_ in calling him the living God (which means everliving_ the eternal God_ that has life in himself) and in appealing to him as the sole and sovereign Judge. We can swear by no greater_ and it is an affront to him to swear by any other,20250223
He speaks ironically: __No doubt you are the people; you think yourselves fit to dictate and give law to all mankind_ and your own judgment to be the standard by which every man's opinion must be measured and tried_ as if nobody could discern between truth and falsehood_ good and evil_ but you only; and therefore every top-sail must lower to you_ and_ right or wrong_ we must all say as you say_ and you three must be the people_ the majority_ to have the casting vote.__ Note_ It is a very foolish and sinful thing for any to think themselves wiser than all mankind besides_ or to speak and act confidently and imperiously_ as if they thought so. Nay_ he goes further: __You not only think there are none_ but that there will be none_ as wise as you_ and therefore that wisdom must die with you_ that all the world must be fools when you are gone_ and in the dark when your sun has set.__ Note_ It is folly for us to think that there will be any great irreparable loss of us when we are gone_ or that we can be ill spared_ since God has the residue of the Spirit_ and can raise up others_ more fit than we are_ to do his work. When wise men and good men die it is a comfort to think that wisdom and goodness shall not die with them. Some think Job here reflects upon Zophar's comparing him (as he thought) and others to the wild ass's colt_ ch. xi,20250223
He speaks of himself as wanting a revelation to guide him in the ways of truth and wisdom. He owns (v. 3) __I neither learned wisdom by any power of my own (the depths of it cannot be fathomed by my line and plummet) nor know I the knowledge of the holy ones_ the angels_ our first parents in innocency_ nor of the holy things of God; I can get no insight into them_ nor make any judgment of them_ further than God is pleased to make them known to me.__ The natural man_ the natural powers_ perceive not_ nay_ they receive not_ the things of the Spirit of God. Some suppose Agur to be asked_ as Apollo's oracle was of old_ Who was the wisest man? The answer is_ He that is sensible of his own ignorance_ especially in divine things. Hoc tantum scio_ me nihil scire—All that I know is that I know nothing.,20250223
He speaks of robbers_ and those that do wrong by downright force_ as the bands of the Sabeans and Chaldeans_ which had lately plundered him. He does not mention them particularly_ lest he should seem partial to his own cause_ and to judge of men (as we are apt to do) by what they are to us; but among the Arabians_ the children of the east (Job's country)_ there were those that lived by spoil and rapine_ making incursions upon their neighbours_ and robbing travellers. See how they are described here_ and what mischief they do_ v. 5-8. 1. Their character is that they are as wild asses in the desert_ untamed_ untractable_ unreasonable_ Ishmael's character (Gen. xvi. fierce and furious_ and under no restraint of law or government_ Jer. ii. 23_ 24. They choose the deserts for their dwelling_ that they may be lawless and unsociable_ and that they may have opportunity of doing the more mischief. The desert is indeed the fittest place for such wild people_ ch. xxxix,20250223
He speaks of them with amazement at their intolerable pride and insolence: __Oh how lofty are their eyes! With what disdain do they look upon their neighbours_ as not worthy to be set with the dogs of their flock! What a distance do they expect every body should keep; and_ when they look upon themselves_ how do they strut and vaunt like the peacock_ thinking they make themselves illustrious when really they make themselves ridiculous!__ There is a generation of such_ on whom he that resists the proud will pour contempt,20250223
He speaks once_ yea_ twice; if that prevail not_ he works twice_ yea_ thrice; he changes his method (we have piped_ we have mourned) returns again to the same method_ repeats the same applications. Why does he take all this pains with man? It is to bring back his soul from the pit_ v,20250223
He speaks this_ perhaps_ in a way of pity_ lamenting that through the extremity of his affliction he could not apply those comforts to himself which he had formerly administered to others. It is easier to give good counsel than to take it_ to preach meekness and patience than to practise them. Facile omnes_ cum valemus_ rectum consilium ægrotis damus—We all find it easy_ when in health_ to give good advice to the sick.—Terent. ,20250223
He steered his course towards the house of one that he thought would entertain him_ and that he might be merry with; he went near her corner_ the way to her house (v. contrary to Solomon's advice (ch. v.,20250223
He still holds fast his integrity_ concerning which he appeals to God's righteous judgment from the unrighteous censures of his friends_ ver. 14-22.,20250223
He stood upon his guard against the love of the world_ and carefully avoided all sinful indirect means of getting wealth. He dreaded all forbidden profit as much as all forbidden pleasure. Let us see_,20250223
He stood_ and cried_ Come unto me. We see who invited; now let us observe_,20250223
He stretches out the north over the empty place_ v,20250223
He suffers those to prey upon him that he is under no obligation to: A stranger eateth it. This is the common fate of misers; they will not trust their own children perhaps_ but retainers and hangers-on_ that have the art of wheedling_ insinuate themselves into them_ and find ways of devouring what they have_ or getting it to be left to them by their wills. God orders it so that a stranger eats it. Strangers devour his strength_ Hos. vii. 9; Prov. v,20250223
He supposes his prosperity to be very high_ as high as you can imagine_ v,20250223
He takes away our breath_ and we die; nay_ he but looks on the earth and it trembles_ Ps. xiv. 29_ 30. ,20250223
He takes away our creature-comforts and confidences when and as he pleases_ takes away health_ estate_ relations_ friends_ takes away life itself; whatever goes_ it is he that takes it; by what hand so ever it is removed_ his hand must be acknowledged in its removal. The Lord takes away_ and who can hinder him? Who can turn him away? (Margin_ Who shall make him restore?) Who can dissuade him or alter his counsels? Who can resist him or oppose his operations? Who can control him or call him to an account? What action can be brought against him? Or who will say unto him_ What doest thou? Or_ Why doest thou so? Dan. iv,20250223
He takes away_ and who can hinder him? so he says again. What God says cannot be gainsaid_ nor what he does undone. There is no rebuilding what God will have to lie in ruins; witness the tower of Babel_ which the undertakers could not go on with_ and the desolations of Sodom and Gomorrah_ which could never be repaired. See Isa. xxv. 2; Ezek. xxvi. 14; Rev. xviii,20250223
He takes notice of Job's former serviceableness to the comfort of others. He owns that Job had instructed many_ not only his own children and servants_ but many others_ his neighbours and friends_ as many as fell within the sphere of his activity. He did not only encourage those who were teachers by office_ and countenance them_ and pay for the teaching of those who were poor_ but he did himself instruct many. Though a great man_ he did not think it below him (king Solomon was a preacher); though a man of business_ he found time to do it_ went among his neighbours_ talked to them about their souls_ and gave them good counsel. O that this example of Job were imitated by our great men! If he met with those who were ready to fall into sin_ or sink under their troubles_ his words upheld them: a wonderful dexterity he had in offering that which was proper to fortify persons against temptations_ to support them under their burdens_ and to comfort afflicted consciences. He had_ and used_ the tongue of the learned_ knew how to speak a word in season to those that were weary_ and employed himself much in that good work. With suitable counsels and comforts he strengthened the weak hands for work and service and the spiritual warfare_ and the feeble knees for bearing up the man in his journey and under his load. It is not only our duty to lift up our own hands that hang down_ by quickening and encouraging ourselves in the way of duty (Heb. xii. but we must also strengthen the weak hands of others_ as there is occasion_ and do what we can to confirm their feeble knees_ by saying to those that are of a fearful heart_ Be strong_ Isa. xxxv. 3_ 4. The expressions seem to be borrowed thence. Note_ Those should abound in spiritual charity. A good word_ well and wisely spoken_ may do more good than perhaps we think of. But why does Eliphaz mention this here? ,20250223
He takes them into partnership with him in the examination and discussion of this matter_ v,20250223
He teaches him what he should say_ ver. 31_ 32. And then_ lastly_ he leaves the matter to Job's own conscience_ and concludes with a sharp reproof of him for his peevishness and discontent_ ver. 33-37. All this Job not only bore patiently_ but took kindly_ because he saw that Elihu meant well; and_ whereas his other friends had accused him of that from which his own conscience acquitted him_ Elihu charged him with that only for which_ it is probable_ his own heart_ now upon the reflection_ began to smite him.,20250223
He tells us what was the result of this trial_ to confirm what he had said_ that all is vanity.,20250223
He that cleaves the wood_ especially if_ as it follows_ he has sorry tools (v. shall be endangered thereby; the chips_ or his own axe-head_ will fly in his face. If we meet with knotty pieces of timber_ and we think to master them by force and violence_ and hew them to pieces_ they may not only prove too hard for us_ but the attempt may turn to our own damage.,20250223
He that commits adultery is in the high road to destruction. The bold presumptuous sinner says_ __I may venture upon the sin and yet escape the punishment; I shall have peace though I go on.__ He might as well say_ I will take fire into my bosom and not burn my clothes_ or I will go upon hot coals and not burn my feet. He that goes into his neighbour's wife_ however he holds himself_ God will not hold him guiltless. The fire of lust kindles the fire of hell.,20250223
He that digs a pit for another_ it is ten to one but he falls into it himself_ and his violent dealing returns upon his own head. If princes become tyrants_ or subjects become rebels_ all histories will tell both what is likely to be their fate and that it is at their utmost peril_ and it were better for both to be content within their own bounds. ,20250223
He that formed the spirit of man within him knows all the avenues to it_ and which way to enter into it; he can find the hole of the door at which to put in his hand for the conquering of prejudices and the introducing of his own doctrine and law. He has the key of David (Rev. iii.,20250223
He that gave being has an incontestable authority to give laws_ and can enforce the laws he gives. He that made all has a right to dispose of all according to his own will_ with an absolute sovereignty. Whatever he will do he does_ and may do; and none can say unto him_ What doest thou? or Why doest thou so? Dan. iv,20250223
He that has a giddy head_ a roving rambling fancy_ will never be fit for any solid business. He is a fool_ and good for nothing_ whose eyes are in the ends of the earth_ here_ and there and every where_ any where but where they should be_ who cannot fix his thoughts to one subject nor pursue any one purpose with any thing of steadiness. When his mind should be applied to his study and business it is filled with a thousand things foreign and impertinent.,20250223
He that has silver in abundance_ and has it increasing ever so fast upon him_ yet does not find that it yields any solid satisfaction to his soul. There are bodily desires which silver itself will not satisfy; if a man be hungry_ ingots of silver will do no more to satisfy his hunger than clods of clay. Much less will worldly abundance satisfy spiritual desires; he that has ever so much silver covets more_ not only of that_ but of something else_ something of another nature. Those that make themselves drudges to the world are spending their labour for that which satisfies not (Isa. lv. which fills the belly_ but will never fill the soul_ Ezek. vii. 19.,20250223
He that is blessed with a good wife is as happy as if he were upon the throne_ for she is no less than a crown to him. A virtuous woman_ that is pious and prudent_ ingenious and industrious_ that is active for the good of her family and looks well to the ways of her household_ that makes conscience of her duty in every relation_ a woman of spirit_ that can bear crosses without disturbance_ such a one owns her husband for her head_ and therefore she is a crown to him_ not only a credit and honour to him_ as a crown is an ornament_ but supports and keeps up his authority in his family_ as a crown is an ensign of power. She is submissive and faithful to him and by her example teaches his children and servants to be so too,20250223
He that is born to-day_ and dies to-morrow_,20250223
He that is foolish cannot avoid proclaiming his folly_ and it is his shame that he cannot: The heart of fools_ by their foolish words and actions_ proclaims foolishness; either they do not desire to hide it_ so little sense have they of good and evil_ honour and dishonour_ or they know not how to hide it_ so little discretion have they in the management of themselves_ Eccl. x. 3.,20250223
He that is plagued with a bad wife is as miserable as if he were upon the dunghill; for she is no better than rottenness in his bones_ an incurable disease_ besides that she makes him ashamed. She that is silly and slothful_ wasteful and wanton_ passionate and ill-tongued_ ruins both the credit and comfort of her husband. If he go abroad_ his head is hung down_ for his wife's faults turn to his reproach. If he retire into himself_ his heart is sunk; he is continually uneasy; it is an affliction that preys much upon the spirits.,20250223
He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.,20250223
He that is so humble that he takes it well to be told of his faults shall certainly be exalted: He that regards a reproof_ whoever gives it to him_ and will mend what is amiss when it is shown him_ gains respect as wise and candid; he avoids that which would be a disgrace to him and is in a fair way to make himself considerable.,20250223
He that is so proud that he scorns to be taught will certainly be abased. He that refuses the good instruction offered him_ as if it were a reflection upon his honour and an abridgment of his liberty_ poverty and shame shall be to him: he will become a beggar and live and die in disgrace; every one will despise him as foolish_ and stubborn_ and ungovernable,20250223
He that is the preacher of this doctrine was king over Israel_ whom all their neighbours admired as a wise and understanding people_ Deut. iv,20250223
He that is wise does not affect to proclaim his wisdom_ and it is his honour that he does not. He communicates his knowledge when it may turn to the edification of others_ but he conceals it when the showing of it would only tend to his own commendation. Knowing men_ if they be prudent men_ will carefully avoid every thing that savours of ostentation_ and not take all occasions to show their learning and reading_ but only to use it for good purposes_ and then let their own works praise them. Ars est celare artem—The perfection of art is to conceal it,20250223
He that knows how to discourse will make the place he lives in a paradise,20250223
He that lives a thousand years goes to the same place with the child that does not live an hour_ ch. iii,20250223
He that loves silver_ and sets his heart upon it_ will never think he has enough_ but enlarges his desire as hell (Hab. ii. lays house to house and field to field (Isa. v. and_ like the daughters of the horse-leech_ still cries_ Give_ give. Natural desires are at rest when that which is desired is obtained_ but corrupt desires are insatiable. Nature is content with little_ grace with less_ but lust with nothing.,20250223
He that made him can make his sword to approach to him (v. that is_ the same hand that made him_ notwithstanding his great bulk and strength_ can unmake him again at pleasure and kill an elephant as easily as a worm or a fly_ without any difficulty_ and without the imputation either of waste or wrong. God that gave to all the creatures their being may take away the being he gave; for may he not do what he will with his own? And he can do it; he that has power to create with a word no doubt has power to destroy with a word_ and can as easily speak the creature into nothing as at first he spoke it out of nothing. The behemoth perhaps is here intended (as well as the leviathan afterwards) to represent those proud tyrants and oppressors whom God had just now challenged Job to abase and bring down. They think themselves as well fortified against the judgments of God as the elephant with his bones of brass and iron; but he that made the soul of man knows all the avenues to it_ and can make the sword of justice_ his wrath_ to approach to it_ and touch it in the most tender and sensible part. He that framed the engine_ and put the parts of it together_ knows how to take it in pieces. Woe to him therefore that strives with his Maker_ for he that made him has therefore power to make him miserable_ and will not make him happy unless he will be ruled by him.,20250223
He that made himself so much talked of shall_ when he is dead_ be no more remembered with honour; his name shall rot_ Prov. x,20250223
He that so far wants understanding as to be drawn aside by these enticements is led on_ ignorantly_ to his own inevitable ruin: He knows not_ will not believe_ does not consider_ the tempter will not let him know_ that the dead are there_ that those who live in pleasure are dead while they live_ dead in trespasses and sins.,20250223
He that speaketh flattery to his friends_ even the eyes of his children shall fail. 6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. 7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow_ and all my members are as a shadow. 8 Upright men shall be astonied at this_ and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. 9 The righteous also shall hold on his way_ and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.,20250223
He then looked upon it as folly_ and it was with reluctance that he gave himself to it; as St. Paul_ when he commended himself_ called it a weakness_ and desired to be borne with in his foolishness_ 2 Cor. xi. 1. He sought to lay hold on folly_ to see the utmost that that folly would do towards making men happy; but he had like to have carried the jest (as we say) too far. He resolved that the folly should not take hold of him_ not get the mastery of him_ but he would lay hold on it_ and keep it at a distance; yet he found it too hard for him,20250223
He therefore runs up all the streams of actual transgression to the fountain of original corruption. The source of all the folly and madness that are in the world is in man's apostasy from God and his degeneracy from his primitive rectitude (v. 20): __Lo_ this only have I found; when I could not find out the particulars_ yet the gross account was manifest enough; it is as clear as the sun that man is corrupted and revolted_ and is not as he was made.__ Observe_ First_ How man was made by the wisdom and goodness of God: God made man upright; Adam the first man_ so the Chaldee. God made him_ and he made him upright_ such a one as he should be; being made a rational creature_ he was_ in all respects_ such a one as a rational creature should be_ upright_ without any irregularity; one could find no fault in him; he was upright_ that is_ determined to God only_ in opposition to the many inventions which he afterwards turned aside to. Man_ as he came out of God's hands_ was (as we may say) a little picture of his Maker_ who is good and upright. Secondly_ How he was marred_ and in effect unmade_ by his own folly and badness: They have sought out many inventions—they_ our first parents_ or the whole race_ all in general and every one in particular. They have sought out great inventions (so some)_ inventions to become great as gods (Gen. iii. or the inventions of the great ones (so some)_ of the angels that fell_ the Magnates_ or many inventions. Man_ instead of resting in what God had found for him_ was for seeking to better himself_ like the prodigal that left his father's house to seek his fortune. Instead of being for one_ he was for many; instead of being for God's institutions_ he was for his own inventions. The law of his creation would not hold him_ but he would be at his own disposal and follow his own sentiments and inclinations. Vain man would be wise_ wiser than his Maker; he is giddy and unsettled in his pursuits_ and therefore has many inventions. Those that forsake God wander endlessly. Men's actual transgressions are multiplied. Solomon could not find out how many they are (v. 28); but he found they were very many. Many kinds of sins_ and those often repeated. They are more than the hairs on our heads_ Ps. xl. 12.,20250223
He therefore thinks it strange that God should thus prolong his torture_ and continue him under the confinement of this affliction_ and neither bring him to a trial nor grant him a release_ as if he must take time to enquire after his iniquity and use means to search after his sin_ v,20250223
He thinks he may expect a favourable hearing; for_ ,20250223
He thinks himself_ in particular_ hardly dealt with_ that he might not be eased of his pain and misery by death when he could not get ease in any other way. To be thus impatient of life for the sake of the troubles we meet with is not only unnatural in itself_ but ungrateful to the giver of life_ and argues a sinful indulgence of our own passion and a sinful inconsideration of our future state. Let it be our great and constant care to get ready for another world_ and then let us leave it to God to order the circumstances of our removal thither as he thinks fit: __Lord_ when and how thou pleasest;__ and this with such an indifference that_ if he should refer it to us_ we would refer it to him again. Grace teaches us_ in the midst of life's greatest comforts_ to be willing to die_ and_ in the midst of its greatest crosses_ to be willing to live. Job_ to excuse himself in this earnest desire which he had to die_ pleads the little comfort and satisfaction he had in life.,20250223
He thinks it would be a piece of justice to him to hear what he had to say: Hear now my reasoning. Perhaps_ though they did not interrupt him in his discourse_ yet they seemed careless_ and did not much heed what he said. He therefore begged that they would not only hear_ but hearken. Note_ We should be very willing and glad to hear what those have to say for themselves whom_ upon any account_ we are tempted to have hard thoughts of. Many a man_ if he could but be fairly heard_ would be fairly acquitted_ even in the consciences of those that run him down.,20250223
He thinks those happy who never began this miserable life; nay_ they are happiest of all: He that has not been is happier than both they. Better never to have been born than be born to see the evil work that is done under the sun_ to see so much wickedness committed_ so much wrong done_ and not only to be in no capacity to mend the matter_ but to suffer ill for doing well. A good man_ how calamitous a condition soever he is in in this world_ cannot have cause to wish he had never been born_ since he is glorifying the Lord even in the fires_ and will be happy at last_ for ever happy. Nor ought any to wish so while they are alive_ for while there is life there is hope; a man is never undone till he is in hell.,20250223
He thought God fought against him and stirred up his whole strength to ruin him: With thy strong hand thou opposest thyself_ or art an adversary against me. He had better thoughts of God (ch. xxiii. 6) when he concluded he would not plead against him with his great power. God has an absolute sovereignty and an irresistible strength_ but he never uses either the one or the other for the crushing or oppressing of any. ,20250223
He thought he had no reason to expect a long life_ for he found himself declining fast (v. 6): My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle_ that is_ __My time is now but short_ and there are but a few sands more in my glass_ which will speedily run out.__ Natural motions are more swift near the centre. Job thought his days ran swiftly because he thought he should soon be at his journey's end; he looked upon them as good as spent already_ and he was therefore without hope of being restored to his former prosperity. It is applicable to man's life in general. Our days are like a weaver's shuttle_ thrown from one side of the web to the other in the twinkling of an eye_ and then back again_ to and fro_ until at length it is quite exhausted of the thread it carried_ and then we cut off_ like a weaver_ our life_ Isa. xxxviii,20250223
He thought he had spoken very fully_ though in few words_ that he had plentifully declared it_ and_ alas! it was but poorly and scantily that he declared it_ in comparison with the vast compass and copiousness of the subject.,20250223
He thought he insulted over him (v. 22): Thou lifted me up to the wind_ as a feather or the chaff which the wind plays with; so unequal a match did Job think himself for Omnipotence_ and so unable was he to help himself when he was made to ride_ not in triumph_ but in terror_ upon the wings of the wind_ and the judgments of God did even dissolve his substance_ as a cloud is dissolved and dispersed by the wind. Man's substance_ take him in his best estate_ is nothing before the power of God; it is soon dissolved.,20250223
He took care at the same time to acquaint himself with wisdom_ to manage himself wisely in the use of his pleasures_ so that they should not do him any prejudice nor disfit him to be a competent judge of them. When he drew his flesh with wine he led his heart with wisdom (so the word is)_ kept up his pursuits after knowledge_ did not make a sot of himself_ nor become a slave to his pleasures_ but his studies and his feasts were foils to each other_ and he tried whether both mixed together would give him that satisfaction which he could not find in either separately. This Solomon proposed to himself_ but he found it vanity; for those that think to give themselves to wine_ and yet to acquaint their hearts with wisdom_ will perhaps deceive themselves as much as those do that think to serve both God and mammon. Wine is a mocker; it is a great cheat; and it will be impossible for any man to say that thus far he will give himself to it and no further,20250223
He took no pleasure in it in comparison with the spiritual things which were the delight of his soul. His joy did not terminate in the gift_ but passed through it to the giver. When he was in the midst of his abundance he never said_ Soul_ take thy ease in these things_ eat_ drink_ and be merry_ nor blessed himself in his riches. He did not inordinately rejoice in his wealth_ which helped him to bear the loss of it so patiently as he did. The way to weep as though we wept not is to rejoice as though we rejoiced not. The less pleasure the enjoyment is the less pain the disappointment will be.,20250223
He took pains in the business of his place (v. 16): The cause which I knew not I searched out. He diligently enquired into the matters of fact_ patiently and impartially heard both sides_ set every thing in its true light_ and cleared it from false colours; he laid all circumstances together_ that he might find out the truth and the merits of every cause_ and then_ and not until then_ gave judgment upon it. He never answered a matter before he heard it_ nor did he judge a man to be righteous_ however he seemed_ for his being first in his own cause_ Prov. xviii. 17.,20250223
He took particular care to clothe those that were without covering_ which would be more expensive to him than feeding them_ v,20250223
He took pleasure in it_ and_ as I may say_ a holy delight. He looked upon it as his greatest glory to do justice to all and injury to none: My judgment was as a robe and a diadem. Perhaps he did not himself wear a robe and a diadem; he was very indifferent to those ensigns of honour; those were most fond of them who had least intrinsic worth to recommend them. But the settled principles of justice_ by which he was governed and did govern_ were to him instead of all those ornaments. If a magistrate do the duty of his place_ that is an honour to him far beyond his gold or purple_ and should be_ accordingly_ his delight; and truly if he do not make conscience of his duty_ and in some measure answer the end of his elevation_ his robe and diadem_ his gown and cap_ his sword and mace_ are but a reproach_ like the purple robe and crown of thorns with which the Jews studied to ridicule our Saviour; for_ as clothes on a dead man will never make him warm_ so robes on a base man will never make him honourable.,20250223
He treads upon the waves of the sea; that is_ he suppresses them and keeps them under_ that they return not to deluge the earth (Ps. civ. which is given as a reason why we should all fear God and stand in awe of him_ Jer. v,20250223
He turns from them to God (v. 3): Surely I would speak to the Almighty; as if he had said_ __I can promise myself no satisfaction in talking to you. O that I might have liberty to reason with God! He would not be so hard upon me as you are.__ The prince himself will perhaps give audience to a poor petitioner with more mildness_ patience_ and condescension_ than the servants will. Job would rather argue with God himself than with his friends. See here,20250223
He turns to God_ and expostulates with him (ver. 7_ to the end)_ in which,20250223
He undertakes to convince him that he had spoken amiss_ by showing very fully,20250223
He upbraids him with his present low-spiritedness_ v,20250223
He upbraids his friends with their unkind usage of him_ ver. 1-5.,20250223
He urges him_ by the persuasions of his own wife_ to curse God_ v,20250223
He utterly denies that God can really be either prejudiced or advantaged by what any_ even the greatest men of the earth_ do_ or can do. ,20250223
He values not the censures of those who are wise in their own conceit: He respecteth them not_ v,20250223
He warmly accuses Job for some passionate words which he had spoken_ that reflected on the divine government_ appealing to the house whether he ought not to be called to the bar and checked for them.,20250223
He was a father to the fatherless_ took care of orphans_ brought them up with him under his own eye_ and gave them_ not only maintenance_ but education. He was a guide to the widow_ who had lost the guide of her youth; he advised her in her affairs_ took cognizance of them_ and undertook the management of them. Those that need not our alms may yet have occasion for our counsel_ and it may be a real kindness to them. This Job says he did from his youth_ from his mother's womb. He had something of tenderness and compassion woven in his nature; he began betimes to do good_ ever since he could remember; he had always some poor widow or fatherless child under his care. His parents taught him betimes to pity and relieve the poor_ and brought up orphans with him. ,20250223
He was a fool who_ when his barns were full_ said_ Soul_ take thine ease.,20250223
He was a night-walker_ that hated and scorned the business that is to be done by day-light_ from which the evening calls men in to their repose; and_ having fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness_ he begins to move in the twilight in the evening_ v,20250223
He was a young man void of understanding_ that went abroad into the world_ not principled as he ought to have been with wisdom and the fear of God_ and so ventured to sea without ballast_ without pilot_ cord_ or compass; he knew not how to depart from evil_ which is the best understanding_ Job xxviii,20250223
He was also employed in the third day's work_ when the waters above the heavens_ were gathered together by establishing the clouds above_ and those under the heavens by strengthening the fountains of the deep_ which send forth those waters (v. and by preserving the bounds of the sea_ which is the receptacle of those waters_ v,20250223
He was alumnus patris—the Father's pupil_ as I may say_ trained up from eternity for that service which in time_ in the fulness of time_ he was to go through with_ and is therein taken under the special tuition and protection of the Father; he is my servant whom I uphold_ Isa. xlii. 1. He did what he saw the Father do (John v. pleased his Father_ sought his glory_ did according to the commandment he received from his Father_ and all this as one brought up with him. He was daily his Father's delight (my elect_ in whom my soul delighteth_ says God_ Isa. xliii.,20250223
He was always ready to grant their desires and answer their expectations_ v,20250223
He was angry at Job_ because he thought he did not speak so reverently of God as he ought to have done; and that was too true (v.,20250223
He was angry at his friends because he thought they had not conducted themselves so charitably towards Job as they ought to have done (v. 3): They had found no answer_ and yet had condemned Job. They had adjudged him to be a hypocrite_ a wicked man_ and would not recede from that sentence concerning him; and yet they could not prove him so_ nor disprove the evidences he produced of his integrity. They could not make good the premises_ and yet held fast the conclusion. They had no reply to make to his arguments_ and yet they would not yield_ but_ right or wrong_ would run him down; and this was not fair. Seldom is a quarrel begun_ and more seldom is a quarrel carried on to the length that this was_ in which there is not a fault on both sides. Elihu_ as became a moderator_ took part with neither_ but was equally displeased with the mistakes and mismanagement of both. Those that in good earnest seek for truth must thus be impartial in their judgments concerning the contenders_ and not reject what is true and good on either side for the sake of what is amiss_ nor approve or defend what is amiss for the sake of what is true and good_ but must learn to separate between the precious and the vile.,20250223
He was fond of death_ and pleased himself with the thoughts of it: his soul (his judgment_ he thought_ but really it was his passion) chose strangling and death rather than life; any death rather than such a life as this. Doubtless this was Job's infirmity; for though a good man would not wish to live always in this world_ and would choose strangling and death rather than sin_ as the martyrs did_ yet he will be content to live as long as pleases God_ not choose death rather than life_ because life is our opportunity of glorifying God and getting ready for heaven.,20250223
He was full of pain_ piercing pain_ pain that went to the bone_ to all his bones_ v,20250223
He was full of sores. Some that are pained in their bones_ yet sleep in a whole skin_ but_ Satan's commission against Job extending both to his bone and to his flesh_ he spared neither. His skin was black upon him_ v. 30.,20250223
He was in a constant fever_ which dried up the radical moisture and even consumed the marrow in his bones. See how frail our bodies are_ which carry in themselves the seeds of our own disease and death. ,20250223
He was in great sorrow by reason of it. His bowels boiled with grief_ and rested not_ v,20250223
He was in no capacity at all to make his part good with God_ v,20250223
He was king of Israel—a king_ and yet it was no disparagement to him to be an instructor of the ignorant_ and a teacher of babes—king of Israel_ that people among whom God was known and his name was great; among them he learned wisdom_ and to them he communicated it. All the earth sought to Solomon to hear his wisdom_ which excelled all men's (1 Kings iv. 30; x. 24); it was an honour to Israel that their king was such a dictator_ such an oracle. Solomon was famous for apophthegms; every word he said had weight in it_ and something that was surprising and edifying. His servants who attended him_ and heard his wisdom_ had_ among them_ collected 3000 proverbs of his which they wrote in their day-books; but these were of his own writing_ and do not amount to nearly a thousand. In these he was divinely inspired. Some think that out of those other proverbs of his_ which were not so inspired_ the apocryphal books of Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of Solomon were compiled_ in which are many excellent sayings_ and of great use; but_ take altogether_ they are far short of this book. The Roman emperors had each of them his symbol or motto_ as many now have with their coat of arms. But Solomon had many weighty sayings_ not as theirs_ borrowed from others_ but all the product of that extraordinary wisdom which God had endued him with.,20250223
He was made partaker of divine revelation (as Maimonides distinguishes_ De Fund. Legis_ c. 7) per vigiliam—while awake_1 whereas God manifested himself to all the other prophets in a dream or vision: and he adds that Moses understood the words of prophecy without any perturbation or astonishment of mind_ whereas the other prophets commonly fainted and were troubled. But the writers of the Hagiographa they suppose to be inspired in a degree somewhat below that of the other prophets_ and to receive divine revelation_ not as they did by dreams_ and visions_ and voices_ but (as Maimonides describes it_ More Nevochim—part 2 c.,20250223
He was never the wiser_ never the better_ for the visit they made him. Note_ Whatever complacency we may take_ or whatever confidence we may put_ in creatures_ how great soever they may seem and how dear soever they may be to us_ one time or other we shall say of them_ Now you are nothing. When Job was in prosperity his friends were something to him_ he took complacency in them and their society; but __Now you are nothing_ now I can find no comfort but in God.__ It were well for us if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature_ and its insufficiency to make us happy_ as we have sometimes had_ or shall have on a sick-bed_ a death-bed_ or in trouble of conscience: __Now you are nothing. You are not what you have been_ what you should be_ what you pretend to be_ what I thought you would have been; for you see my casting down and are afraid. When you saw me in my elevation you caressed me; but now that you see me in my dejection you are shy of me_ are afraid of showing yourselves kind_ lest I should thereby be emboldened to beg something of you_ or to borrow__ (compare v. 22); __you are afraid lest_ if you own me_ you should be obliged to keep me.__ Perhaps they were afraid of catching his distemper or of coming within smell of the noisomeness of it. It is not good_ either out of pride or niceness_ for love of our purses or of our bodies_ to be shy of those who are in distress and afraid of coming near them. Their case may soon be our own.,20250223
He was no less active when_ on the second day_ he stretched out the firmament_ the vast expanse_ and set that as a compass upon the face of the depth (v. surrounded it on all sides with that canopy_ that curtain. Or it may refer to the exact order and method with which God framed all the parts of the universe_ as the workman marks out his work with his line and compasses. The work in nothing varied from the plan of it formed in the eternal mind,20250223
He was not only weak as water_ but_ in his own apprehension_ lost as water spilt upon the ground. Compare Ps. xxii. 14_ My heart is melted like wax.,20250223
He was quite at a loss to know what God designed to do with him; and_ whatever conjecture he advanced_ still something or other appeared against it.,20250223
He was sauntering_ and had nothing to do_ but passed through the street as one that knew not how to dispose of himself. One of the sins of filthy Sodom was abundance of idleness_ Ezek. xvi,20250223
He was sick of life_ and hated the thoughts of it: __I loathe it; I have had enough of it. I would not live always_ not only not live always in this condition_ in pain and misery_ but not live always in the most easy and prosperous condition_ to be continually in danger of being thus reduced. My days are vanity at the best_ empty of solid comfort_ exposed to real griefs; and I would not be for ever tied to such uncertainty.__ Note_ A good man would not (if he might) life always in this world_ no_ not though it smile upon him_ because it is a world of sin and temptation and he has a better world in prospect.,20250223
He was sincere in his religion: He was perfect; not sinless_ as he himself owns (ch. ix. 20): If I say I am perfect_ I shall be proved perverse. But_ having a respect to all God's commandments_ aiming at perfection_ he was really as good as he seemed to be_ and did not dissemble in his profession of piety; his heart was sound and his eye single. Sincerity is gospel perfection. I know no religion without it,20250223
He was the darling of his country. All about him were well pleased with every thing he said and did_ as David's people were with him_ 2 Sam. iii,20250223
He was the oracle of his country. He was consulted as an oracle_ and his dictates were acquiesced in as oracles_ v,20250223
He was the son of David; it was his honour to stand related to that good man_ and he reckoned it so with good reason_ for he fared the better for it_ 1 Kings xi. 12. He had been blessed with a good education_ and many a good prayer had been put up for him (Ps. lxxii. 1)_ the effect of both which appeared in his wisdom and usefulness. The generation of the upright are sometimes thus blessed_ that they are made blessings_ eminent blessings_ in their day. Christ is often called the Son of David_ and Solomon was a type of him in this_ as in other things_ that he opened his mouth in parables or proverbs,20250223
He was the sovereign of his country_ v,20250223
He was upright in his dealings both with God and man_ was faithful to his promises_ steady in his counsels_ true to every trust reposed in him_ and made conscience of all he said and did. See Isa. xxxiii,20250223
He was very fretful_ peevish indeed_ for he quarrels with God_ ,20250223
He was very tender of them_ and had a fatherly concern for them_ v,20250223
He went in a starched stately manner_ so (it is said) the word signifies. He appeared to be a nice formal fop_ the top of whose accomplishments was to dress well and walk with a good air; fit game for that bird of prey to fly at,20250223
He wept so much that he had almost lost his sight: My eye is dim by reason of sorrow_ ch. xvi,20250223
He whose hatred is covered by deceit will one time or other be discovered_ and his wickedness shown_ to his shame and confusion_ before the whole congregation; and nothing will do more to make a man odious to all companies. Love (says one) is the best armour_ but the worst cloak_ and will serve dissemblers as the disguise which Ahab put on and perished in.,20250223
He will do it for us when we please him. If we make it our care to be reconciled to God_ and to keep ourselves in his love_ he will incline those that have been envious towards us_ and vexatious to us_ to entertain a good opinion of us and to become our friends. God made Esau to be at peace with Jacob_ Abimelech with Isaac_ and David's enemies to court his favour and desire a league with Israel. The image of God appearing upon the righteous_ and his particular lovingkindness to them_ are enough to recommend them to the respect of all_ even of those that have been most prejudiced against them.,20250223
He will draw nigh to those in a way of mercy who draw nigh to him in a way of duty: He hears the prayer of the righteous_ accepts it_ is well pleased with it_ and will grant an answer of peace to it. It is the prayer of a righteous man that avails much_ Jam. v,20250223
He will give a gracious order for his discharge. He says_ Deliver him (that is_ let him be delivered) from going down to the pit_ from that death which is the wages of sin. When afflictions have done their work they shall be removed. When we return to God in a way of duty he will return to us in a way of mercy. Those shall be delivered from going down to the pit who receive God's messengers_ and rightly understand his interpreters_ so as to subscribe to his uprightness,20250223
He will give a gracious reason for this order: I have found a ransom_ or propitiation; Jesus Christ is that ransom_ so Elihu calls him_ as Job had called him his Redeemer_ for he is both the purchaser and the price_ the priest and the sacrifice; so high was the value put upon souls that nothing less would redeem them_ and so great the injury done by sin that nothing less would atone for it than the blood of the Son of God_ who gave his life a ransom for many. This is a ransom of God's finding_ a contrivance of Infinite Wisdom; we could never have found it ourselves_ and the angels themselves could never have found it. It is the wisdom of God in a mystery_ the hidden wisdom_ and such an invention as is and will be the everlasting wonder of those principalities and powers that desire to look into it. Observe how God glories in the invention here_ heureka_ heureka—__I have found_ I have found_ the ransom; I_ even I_ am he that has done it.__,20250223
He will judge us accordingly. As his knowledge cannot be imposed upon_ so his justice cannot be biassed_ but he will render to every man according to his works_ not only the commission of evil works_ but the omission of good works.,20250223
He will let them into the history of his own life_ will show them all the stages and scenes of it. He will give them a narrative of his conversation_ what would make against him as well as what would make for him_ and let them make what use they pleased of it; and so confident he is of his integrity that as a prince to be crowned_ rather than a prisoner to be tried_ he would go near to him_ both to his accuser to hear his charge and to his judge to hear his doom. Thus the testimony of his conscience was his rejoicing.,20250223
He will not alter his counsels to oblige them_ nor can those that prescribe to him prevail with him to do as they would have him do. He regards the prayer of the humble_ but not the policies of the crafty. No_ the foolishness of God is wiser than men_ 1 Cor. i,20250223
He will not answer_ but he will make supplication to his Judge_ as he had said_ ch. ix. 15.,20250223
He will not repeat their arguments_ nor go upon their principles: __Neither will I answer him with your speeches—not with the same matter_ for should I only say what has been said I might justly be silenced as impertinent_—nor in the same manner; I will not be guilty of that peevishness towards him myself which I dislike in you.__ The controversy that has already been fully handled a wise man will let alone_ unless he can amend and improve what has been done; why should he actum agere—do that which has been done already?,20250223
He will not reply to Job's protestations of his integrity_ but allows the truth of them_ and therefore does not interpose as his enemy: __He hath not directed his words against me. I have nothing to say against the main scope of his discourse_ nor do I differ from his principles. I have only a gentle reproof to give him for his passionate expressions.__ ,20250223
He will pass his word for Job that_ notwithstanding all the wrong his friends had done him_ he is so good a man_ and of such a humble_ tender_ forgiving spirit_ that he will very readily pray for them_ and use his interest in heaven on their behalf: __My servant Job will pray for you. I know he will. I have pardoned him_ and he has the comfort of pardon_ and therefore he will pardon you.__ ,20250223
He will speak_ but it shall be the bitterness of his soul that he will express_ not his settled judgment. If I speak amiss_ it is not I_ but sin that dwells in me_ not my soul_ but its bitterness.,20250223
He wishes to have favour with men also (as Christ had_ Luke ii. to be accepted of the multitude of his brethren (Esth. x.,20250223
He wonders that,20250223
He would have him repent and return to God. Observe the steps of that return. 1. He must look within_ and get his mind changed and the tree made good. He must prepare his heart; there the work of conversion and reformation must begin. The heart that wandered from God must be reduced—that was defiled with sin and put into disorder must be cleansed and put in order again—that was wavering and unfixed must be settled and established; so the word here signifies. The heart is then prepared to seek God when it is determined and fully resolved to make a business of it and to go through with it,20250223
He would have his own protestation to be decisive_ for none but God and himself knew his heart. __Be silent therefore_ and let me hear no more of you_ but hearken diligently to what I say_ and let my own oath for confirmation be an end of the strife.__,20250223
He would have them wonder at it (v. 5): __Mark me_ and be astonished. Instead of expounding my troubles_ you should awfully adore the unsearchable mysteries of Providence in afflicting one thus of whom you know no evil; you should therefore lay your hand upon your mouth_ silently wait the issue_ and judge nothing before the time. God's way is in the sea_ and his path in the great waters. When we cannot account for what he does_ in suffering the wicked to prosper and the godly to be afflicted_ nor fathom the depth of those proceedings_ it becomes us to sit down and admire them. Upright men shall be astonished at this_ ch. xvii,20250223
He would have us not to fret and perplex ourselves about it_ or make ourselves uneasy_ but cheerfully to enjoy what God has given us in the world_ to be content with it and make the best of it_ though it be much better with others_ and such as we think very unworthy (v. 15): Then I commended joy_ a holy security and serenity of mind_ arising from a confidence in God_ and his power_ providence_ and promise_ because a man has no better thing under the sun (though a good man has much better things above the sun) than to eat and drink_ that is_ soberly and thankfully to make use of the things of this life according as his rank is_ and to be cheerful_ whatever happens_ for that shall abide with him of his labour. That is all the fruit he has for himself of the pains that he takes in the business of the world; let him therefore take it_ and much good may it do him; and let him not deny himself that_ out of a peevish discontent because the world does not go as he would have it. That shall abide with him during the days of his life which God gives him under the sun. Our present life is a life under the sun_ but we look for the life of the world to come_ which will commence and continue when the sun shall be turned into darkness and shine no more. This present life must be reckoned by days; this life is given us_ and the days of it are allotted to us_ by the counsel of God_ and therefore while it does last we must accommodate ourselves to the will of God and study to answer the ends of life.,20250223
He would have us to take occasion hence_ not to charge God with iniquity_ but to charge the world with vanity. No fault is to be found with God; but_ as to the world_ This is vanity upon the earth_ and again_ This is also vanity_ that is_ it is a certain evidence that the things of this world are not the best things nor were ever designed to make a portion and happiness for us_ for_ if they had_ God would not have allotted so much of this world's wealth to his worst enemies and so much of its troubles to his best friends; there must therefore be another life after this the joys and griefs of which must be real and substantial_ and able to make men truly happy or truly miserable_ for this world does neither.,20250223
He would hear them speak when it came to their turn. __After I have spoken you may go on with what you have to say_ and I will not hinder you_ no_ though you go on to mock me.__ Those that engage in controversy must reckon upon having hard words given them_ and resolve to bear reproach patiently; for_ generally_ those that mock will mock on_ whatever is said to them. ,20250223
He would not own he had been doing any hurt_ that he had been drawing men from the allegiance to God_ deceiving and destroying souls; no. I have done no wickedness_ Prov. xxx.,20250223
He would not so much as admit a wanton look. He made a covenant with his eyes_ made this bargain with them_ that he would allow them the pleasure of beholding the light of the sun and the glory of God shining in the visible creation_ provided they would never fasten upon any object that might occasion any impure imaginations_ much less any impure desires_ in his mind; and under this penalty_ that_ if they did_ they must smart for it in penitential tears. Note_ Those that would keep their hearts pure must guard their eyes_ which are both the outlets and inlets of uncleanness. Hence we read of wanton eyes (Isa. iii. 16) and eyes full of adultery_ 2 Pet. ii,20250223
He would not so much as allow a wanton thought: __Why then should I think upon a maid with any unchaste fancy or desire towards her?__ Shame and sense of honour might restrain him from soliciting the chastity of a beautiful virgin_ but only grace and the fear of God would restrain him from so much as thinking of it. Those are not chaste that are not so in spirit as well as body_ 1 Cor. vii,20250223
He wraps himself up in security and sensuality (v. 27): He covers his face with his fatness. This signifies both the pampering of his flesh with daily delicious fare and the hardening of his heart thereby against the judgments of God. Note_ The gratifying of the appetites of the body_ feeding and feasting that to the full_ often turns to the damage of the soul and its interests. Why is God forgotten and slighted_ but because the belly is made a god of and happiness placed in the delights of sense? Those that fill themselves with wine and strong drink abandon all that is serious and flatter themselves with hopes that tomorrow shall be as this day_ Isa. lvi,20250223
He yet asserts that those who know him (that is_ wise and good people who are acquainted with him_ and with whom his secret is) do not see his day_—the day of his judging for them; this was the thing he complained of in his own case (ch. xxiii. that he could not see God appearing on his behalf to plead his cause_—the day of his judging against open and notorious sinners_ that is called his day_ Ps. xxxvii,20250223
Hear this_ That God is to be acknowledged and submitted to in all that he does. Divers considerations Elihu here suggests to Job_ to beget in him great and high thoughts of God_ and so to persuade him to submit and proceed no further in his quarrel with him.,20250223
Heaven is his bed_ the rest into which he entered when he had done his work. Or it may be meant of the sweet repose and satisfaction which gracious souls enjoy in communion with him; it is called his bed_ because_ though we are admitted to it_ and therefore it is called our bed (ch. i. yet it is his peace that is our rest_ John xiv,20250223
Heavenly wisdom is better than worldly wealth_ and to be preferred before it. Grace is more valuable than gold. Grace is the gift of God's peculiar favour; gold only of common providence. Grace is for ourselves; gold for others. Grace is for the soul and eternity; gold only for the body and time. Grace will stand us in stead in a dying hour_ when gold will do us no good,20250223
Heavenly wisdom will procure that for us_ and secure that to us_ which silver_ and gold_ and rubies_ will not be the purchase of.,20250223
Hence,20250223
Hence he infers that it is our wisdom to make the best use of life that we can while it does last_ and manage wisely what remains of it.,20250223
Hence he observes that wise and good men_ notwithstanding this_ must often content themselves with the satisfaction of having done good_ or at least attempted it_ and offered at it_ when they cannot do the good they would do nor have the praise they should have. Wisdom capacitates a man to serve his neighbours_ and he offers his service; but_ alas! if he be poor his wisdom is despised and his words are not heard_ v,20250223
Her breasts; these are like two young roes that are twins_ v,20250223
Her children grow up in her place_ and they call her blessed. They give her their good word_ they are themselves a commendation to her_ and they are ready to give great commendations of her; they pray for her_ and bless God that they had such a good mother. It is a debt which they owe her_ a part of that honour which the fifth commandment requires to be paid to father and mother; and it is a double honour that is due to a good father and a good mother. ,20250223
Her eyes. A good eye contributes much to a beauty: Thou hast doves' eyes_ clear and chaste_ and often cast up towards heaven. It is not the eagle's eye_ that can face the sun_ but the dove's eye_ a humble_ modest_ mournful eye_ that is the praise of those whom Christ loves. Ministers are the church's eyes (Isa. lii. 8_ thy watchmen shall see eye to eye); they must be like doves' eyes_ harmless and inoffensive (Matt. x. having their conversation in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity. Wisdom and knowledge are the eyes of the new man; they must be clear_ but not haughty_ not exercised in things too high for us. When our aims and intentions are sincere and honest_ then we have doves' eyes_ when we look not unto idols (Ezek. xviii. but have our eyes ever towards the Lord_ Ps. xxv,20250223
Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. 6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life_ her ways are moveable_ that thou canst not know them. 7 Hear me now therefore_ O ye children_ and depart not from the words of my mouth. 8 Remove thy way far from her_ and come not nigh the door of her house: 9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others_ and thy years unto the cruel: 10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger,20250223
Her hair; it is compared to a flock of goats_ which looked white_ and were_ on the top of the mountains_ like a fine head of hair; and the sight was more pleasant to the spectator because the goats have not only gravity from their beards_ but they are comely in going (Prov. xxx. but it was most pleasant of all to the owner_ much of whose riches consisted in his flocks. Christ puts a value upon that in the church_ and in believers_ which others make no more account of than of their hair. He told his disciples that the very hairs of their head were all numbered_ as carefully as men number their flocks (Matt. x. and that not a hair of their head should perish_ Luke xxi.,20250223
Her house_ though richly decked and furnished_ and called a house of pleasure_ is the way to hell; and her chambers are the stair-case that goes down to the chambers of death and everlasting darkness. The cup of fornication must shortly be exchanged for the cup of trembling; and the flames of lust_ if not quenched by repentance and mortification_ will burn to the lowest hell. Therefore stand in awe and sin not.,20250223
Her husband thinks himself so happy in her that he takes all occasions to speak well of her_ as one of the best of women. It is no indecency at all_ but a laudable instance of conjugal love_ for husbands and wives to give one another their due praises.,20250223
Her lips; these are compared to a thread of scarlet_ v,20250223
Her mother's children made her the drudge of the family. Cursed be their anger_ for it was fierce_ and their wrath_ for it was cruel. The spouse of Christ has met with a great deal of hard usage.,20250223
Her neck; this is here compared to the tower of David_ v,20250223
Her own works will praise her; if her relations and neighbours altogether hold their peace_ her good works will proclaim her praise. The widows gave the best encomium of Dorcas when they showed the coats and garments she had made for the poor_ Acts ix,20250223
Her petition for divine grace: Draw me. This implies sense of distance from him_ desire of union with him. __Draw me to thyself_ draw me nearer_ draw me home to thee.__ She had prayed that he would draw nigh to her (v. 2); in order to that_ she prays that he would draw her nigh to him. __Draw me_ not only with the moral suasion which there is in the fragrancy of the good ointments_ not only with the attractives of that name which is as ointment poured forth_ but with supernatural grace_ with the cords of a man and the bands of love___ Hos. xi,20250223
Her praise. Christ is the rock_ to whom she flies for shelter and in whom alone she can think herself safe and find herself easy_ as a dove in the hole of a rock_ when struck at by the birds of prey_ Jer. xlviii,20250223
Her profession of piety. She had been to-day at the temple_ and was as well respected there as any that worshipped in the courts of the Lord. She had paid her vows_ and_ as she thought_ made all even with God Almighty_ and therefore might venture upon a new score of sins. Note_ The external performances of religion_ if they do not harden men against sin_ harden them in it_ and embolden carnal hearts to venture upon it_ in hopes that when they come to count and discount with God he will be found as much in debt to them for their peace-offerings and their vows as they to him for their sins. But it is sad that a show of piety should become the shelter of iniquity (which really doubles the shame of it_ and makes it more exceedingly sinful) and that men should baffle their consciences with those very things that should startle them. The Pharisees made long prayers_ that they might the more plausibly carry on their covetous and mischievous provisions. The greatest part of the flesh of the peace-offerings was by the law returned back to the offerers_ to feast upon with their friends_ which (if they were peace-offerings of thanksgiving) was to be all eaten the same day and none of it left until the morning_ Lev. vii,20250223
Her promise to improve that grace: Draw me_ and then we will run after thee. See how the doctrine of special and effectual grace consists with our duty_ and is a powerful engagement and encouragement to it_ and yet reserves all the glory of all the good that is in us to God only. Observe_,20250223
Her prosperity_ that she was compassed about with so many blessings that she had occasion to offer peace-offerings_ in token of joy and thankfulness; she was before-hand in the world_ so that he needed not fear having his pocket picked. ,20250223
Her request to him that she might be admitted into his society: Tell me where thou feedest. Those that would be told_ that would be taught_ what they are concerned to know and do_ must apply to Jesus Christ_ and beg of him to teach them_ to tell them. __Tell me where to find thee_ where I may have conversation with thee_ where thou feedest and tendest thy flock_ that there I may have some of my company.__ Observe_ by the way_ We should not_ in love to our friends and their company_ tempt them or urge them to neglect their business_ but desire such an enjoyment of them as will consist with it_ and rather_ if we can_ to join with them in their business and help to forward it. __Tell me where thou feedest_ and there I will sit with thee_ walk with thee_ feed my flocks with thine_ and not hinder thee nor myself_ but bring my work with me.__ Note_ Those whose souls love Jesus Christ earnestly desire to have communion with him_ by his word in which he speaks to us and by prayer in which we speak to him_ and to share in the privileges of his flock; and we may learn from the care he takes of his church_ to provide convenient food and rest for it_ how to take care of our own souls_ which are our charge,20250223
Her teeth_ v,20250223
Her temples_ or cheeks_ which are here compared to a piece of a pomegranate_ a fruit which_ when cut in two_ has rich veins or specks in it_ like a blush in the face. Humility and modesty_ blushing to lift up our faces before God_ blushing at the remembrance of sin and in a sense of our unworthiness of the honour put upon us_ will beautify us very much in the eyes of Christ. The blushes of Christ's bride are within her locks_ which intimates (says Mr. Durham) that she blushes when no other sees_ and for that which none sees but God and conscience; also that she seeks not to proclaim her humility_ but modestly covers that too; yet the evidences of all these_ in a tender walk_ appear and are comely.,20250223
Her words_ both in her devotion to God and her discourses with men (v. 11): Thy lips O my spouse! drop as the honeycomb_ drop that which is very sweet_ and drop it freely and plentifully. If what God speaks to us be sweeter to us than the honey and the honeycomb (Ps. xix. what we say to him in prayer and praise shall also be pleasing to him: Sweet is thy voice. And if out of a good treasure in the heart we bring forth good things_ if our speech be always with grace_ if our lips use knowledge aright_ if they disperse knowledge_ they then_ in Christ's account_ even drop the honeycomb_ out-drop it. Honey and milk (the two staple commodities of Canaan) are under thy tongue; that is_ in thy heart_ not only reserved there for thy own use as a sweet morsel for thyself_ but ready there for the use of others. In the word of God there is sweet and wholesome nourishment_ milk for babes_ honey for those that are grown up. Christ is well-pleased with those that are full of his word.,20250223
Here,20250223
Here Job makes a very large and sad complaint of the great disgrace he had fallen into_ from the height of honour and reputation_ which was exceedingly grievous and cutting to such an ingenuous spirit as Job's was. Two things he insists upon as greatly aggravating his affliction:—,20250223
Here Job shows,20250223
Here Job touches briefly upon the main point now in dispute between him and his friends. They maintained that those who are righteous and good always prosper in this world_ and none but the wicked are in misery and distress; he asserted_ on the contrary_ that it is a common thing for the wicked to prosper and the righteous to be greatly afflicted. This is the one thing_ the chief thing_ wherein he and his friends differed; and they had not proved their assertion_ therefore he abides by his: __I said it_ and day it again_ that all things come alike to all.__ Now,20250223
Here Solomon fastens upon another instance of the vanity of this world_ that frequently the more men have of it the more they would have; and on this they are so intent that they have no enjoyment of what they have. Now Solomon here shows_,20250223
Here Solomon gives another general rule to young people_ in order to their finding out_ and keeping in_ the paths of wisdom_ and that is to take heed of the snare of bad company. David's psalms begin with this caution_ and so do Solomon's proverbs; for nothing is more destructive_ both to a lively devotion and to a regular conversation (v. 10): __My son_ whom I love_ and have a tender concern for_ if sinners entice thee_ consent thou not.__ This is good advice for parents to give their children when they send them abroad into the world; it is the same that St. Peter gave to his new converts_ (Acts ii.,20250223
Here Solomon returns to the observation and consideration of the vanity and vexation of spirit that attend the business of this world_ which he had spoken of before_ ch. ii. 11.,20250223
Here The pleasure we are apt to take in the troubles of an enemy is forbidden us. If any have done us an ill turn_ or if we bear them ill-will only because they stand in our light or in our way_ when any damage comes to them (suppose they fall)_ or any danger (suppose they stumble)_ our corrupt hearts are too apt to conceive a secret delight and satisfaction in it—Aha! so would we have it; they are entangled; the wilderness has shut them in—or_ as Tyrus said concerning Jerusalem (Ezek. xxvi. 2) I shall be replenished_ now she is laid waste. __Men hope in the ruin of their enemies or rivals to wreak their revenge or to find their account; but be not thou so inhuman; rejoice not when the worst enemy thou hast falls.__ There may be a holy joy in the destruction of God's enemies_ as it tends to the glory of God and the welfare of the church (Ps. lviii. 10); but in the ruin of our enemies_ as such_ we must by no means rejoice; on the contrary_ we must weep even with them when they weep (as David_ Ps. xxxv. 13_ and that in sincerity_ not so much as letting our hearts be secretly glad at their calamities,20250223
Here again Solomon shows the sin and folly of those that will be rich; they are resolved that they will be so_ per fas_ per nefas—right or wrong; they will be so with all speed; they are getting hastily an estate. 1. They have no comfort in it: They have an evil eye_ that is_ they are always grieving at those that have more than they_ and always grudging their necessary expenses_ because they think the former keep them from seeming rich_ the latter from being so_ and between both they must needs be perpetually uneasy,20250223
Here are,20250223
Here are lessons for wise men_ that is_ judges and princes. As subjects must do their duty_ and be obedient to magistrates_ so magistrates must do their duty in administering justice to their subjects_ both in pleas of the crown and causes between party and party. These are lessons for them. 1. They must always weigh the merits of a cause_ and not be swayed by any regard_ one way or other_ to the parties concerned: It is not good in itself_ nor can it ever do well_ to have respect of persons in judgment; the consequences of it cannot but be the perverting of justice and doing wrong under colour of law and equity. A good judge will know the truth_ not know faces_ so as to countenance a friend and help him out in a bad cause_ or so much as omit any thing that can be said or done in favour of a righteous cause_ when it is the cause of an enemy,20250223
Here are two maxims in politics_ which carry their own evidence with them:—1. That it is much for the honour of a king to have a populous kingdom; it is a sign that he rules well_ since strangers are hereby invited to come and settle under his protection and his own subjects live comfortably; it is a sign that he and his kingdom are under the blessing of God_ the effect of which is being fruitful and multiplying. It is his strength_ and makes him considerable and formidable; happy is the king_ the father of his country_ who has his quiver full of arrows; he shall not be ashamed_ but shall speak with his enemy in the gate_ Ps. cxxvii. 4_ 5. It is therefore the wisdom of princes_ by a mild and gentle government_ by encouraging trade and husbandry_ and by making all easy under them_ to promote the increase of their people. And let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ_ and to his honour_ do what they can in their places that many may be added to his church.,20250223
Here are two things to be wondered at:—1. A wise man not satisfied with his wisdom_ but still seeking the increase of it; the more he has the more he would have: The heart of him that has understanding_ rejoices so in the knowledge it has attained to that it is still coveting more_ and in the use of the means of knowledge is still labouring for more_ growing in grace_ and in the knowledge of Christ. Si dixisti_ Sufficit_ periisti—If you say_ I have enough_ you are undone,20250223
Here are two things which are more valuable and which we should covet more than great riches:—1. To be well spoken of: A name (that is_ a good name_ a name for good things with God and good people) is rather to be chosen than great riches; that is_ we should be more careful to do that by which we may get and keep a good name than that by which we may raise and increase a great estate. Great riches bring great cares with them_ expose men to danger_ and add no real value to a man. A fool and a knave may have great riches_ but a good name makes a man easy and safe_ supposes a man wise and honest_ redounds to the glory of God_ and gives a man a greater opportunity of doing good. By great riches we may relieve the bodily wants of others_ but by a good name we may recommend religion to them,20250223
Here he gives the reason of his silence; it was not because he was sullen_ but because he was convinced he had been in the wrong. Those that are truly sensible of their own sinfulness and vileness dare not justify themselves before God_ but are ashamed that ever they entertained such a thought_ and_ in token of their shame_ lay their hand upon their mouth,20250223
Here he mentions another pleasure which we must not take too much of_ that of visiting our friends_ the former for fear of surfeiting ourselves_ this for fear of surfeiting our neighbour. 1. It is a piece of civility to visit our neighbours sometimes_ to show our respect to them and concern for them_ and to cultivate and improve mutual acquaintance and love_ and that we may have both the satisfaction and advantage of their conversation,20250223
Here he reflects_ not only upon Job himself_ but either upon all the managers of the conference (thinking perhaps that Eliphaz and Zophar did not speak so closely to the purpose as they might have done) or upon some that were present_ who possibly took part with Job_ and put in a word now and then in his favour_ though it be not recorded. Bildad was weary of hearing others speak_ and impatient till it came to his turn_ which cannot be observed to any man's praise_ for we ought to be swift to hear and slow to speak. It is common for contenders to monopolize the reputation of wisdom_ and then to insist upon it as their privilege to be dictators. How unbecoming this conduct is in others every one can see; but few that are guilty of it can see it in themselves. Time was when Job had the last word in all debates (ch. xxix. 22): After my words they spoke not again. Then he was in power and prosperity; but now that he was impoverished and brought low he could scarcely be allowed to speak at all_ and every thing he said was as much vilified as formerly it had been magnified. Wisdom therefore (as the world goes) is good with an inheritance (Eccl. vii. 11); for the poor man's wisdom is despised_ and_ because he is poor_ his words are not heard_ Eccl. ix. 16.,20250223
Here is,20250223
Here is A rational concession of the sweetness of life_ which old people find by experience: Truly the light is sweet; the light of the sun is so; it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold it. Light was the first thing made in the formation of the great world_ as the eye is one of the first in the formation of the body_ the little world. It is pleasant to see the light; the heathen were so charmed with the pleasure of it that they worshipped the sun. It is pleasant by it to see other things_ the many agreeable prospects this world gives us. The light of life is so. Light is put for life_ Job iii. 20_ 23. It cannot be denied that life is sweet. It is sweet to bad men because they have their portion in this life; it is sweet to good men because they have this life as the time of their preparation for a better life; it is sweet to all men; nature says it is so_ and there is no disputing against it; nor can death be desired for its own sake_ but dreaded_ unless as a period to present evils or a passage to future good. Life is sweet_ and therefore we have need to double a guard upon ourselves_ lest we love it too well.,20250223
Here is a description of the worst of sinners_ whose hearts are fully set in them to do evil. 1. They set that at defiance which would deter and detain them from sin: An ungodly witness is one that bears false witness against his neighbour_ and will forswear himself to do another a mischief_ in which there is not only great injustice_ but great impiety; this is one of the worst of men. Or an ungodly witness is one that profanely and atheistically witnesses against religion and godliness_ whose instructions seduce from the words of knowledge (v. 27); such a one scorns judgment_ laughs at the terrors of the Lord_ mocks at that fear_ Job xv,20250223
Here is a doleful representation of Job's grievances. O what reason have we to bless God that we are not making such complaints! He complains_,20250223
Here is a full assurance of faith concerning the complete beauty of the Lord Jesus: __He is altogether lovely. Why should I stand to mention particulars_ when throughout there is nothing amiss?__ She is sensible she does him wrong in the particular descriptions of him_ and comes far short of the dignity and merit of the subject_ and therefore she breaks off with the general encomium: He is truly lovely_ he is wholly so; there is nothing in him but what is amiable_ and nothing amiable but what is in him. He is all desires; he has all in him that one can desire. And therefore all her desire is towards him_ and she seeks him thus carefully and cannot rest contented in the want of him. Who can but love him who is so lovely? ,20250223
Here is a full assurance of hope concerning her own interest in him: __This is my beloved_ and this is my friend; and therefore wonder not that I thus long after him.__ See with what a holy boldness she claims relation to him_ and then with what a holy triumph she proclaims it. It is property that sweetens excellency. To see Christ_ and not to see him as ours_ would be rather a torture than a happiness; but to see one that is thus lovely_ and to see him as ours_ is a complete satisfaction. Here is a true believer_ ,20250223
Here is a further character of good kings_ that they love and delight in those that speak right.,20250223
Here is a great plenty of fruits and great variety_ nothing wanting which might either beautify or enrich this garden_ might make it either delightful or serviceable to its great Lord. Every thing here is the best of the kind. Their chief spices were much more valuable_ because much more durable_ than the choicest of our flowers. Solomon was a great master in botany as well as other parts of natural philosophy; he treated largely of trees (1 Kings iv. and perhaps had reference to some specific qualities of the fruits here specified_ which made them very fit for the purpose for which he alludes to them; but we must be content to observe_ in general_ the saints in the church_ and graces in the saints_ are very fitly compared to these fruits and spices; for_ ,20250223
Here is a particular caution against the sin of uncleanness.,20250223
Here is a splendid feast got ready (v. 2): She has killed her beasts; she has mingled her wine; plenty of meat and drink are provided_ and all of the best. She has killed her sacrifice (so the word is); it is a sumptuous_ but a sacred feast_ a feast upon a sacrifice. Christ has offered up himself a sacrifice for us_ and it is his flesh that is meat indeed and his blood that is drink indeed. The Lord's supper is a feast of reconciliation and joy upon the sacrifice of atonement. The wine is mingled with something richer than itself_ to give it a more than ordinary spirit and flavour. She has completely furnished her table with all the satisfactions that a soul can desire-righteousness and grace_ peace and joy_ the assurances of God's love_ the consolations of the Spirit_ and all the pledges and earnests of eternal life. Observe_ It is all Wisdom's own doing; she has killed the beasts_ she has mingled the wine_ which denotes both the love of Christ_ who makes the provision (he does not leave it to others_ but takes the doing of it into his own hands)_ and the excellency of the preparation. That must needs be exactly fitted to answer the end which Wisdom herself has the fitting up of.,20250223
Here is a stately palace provided_ v. 1. Wisdom_ not finding a house capacious enough for all her guests_ has built one on purpose_ and_ both to strengthen it and to beautify it_ she has hewn out her seven pillars_ which make it to be very firm_ and look very great. Heaven is the house which Wisdom has built to entertain all her guests that are called to the marriage-supper of the Lamb; that is her Father's house_ where there are many mansions_ and whither she has gone to prepare places for us. She has hanged the earth upon nothing_ there in it we have no continuing city; but heaven is a city that has foundations_ has pillars. The church is Wisdom's house_ to which she invites her guests_ supported by the power and promise of God_ as by seven pillars. Probably_ Solomon refers to the temple which he himself had lately built for the service of religion_ and to which he would persuade people to resort_ both to worship God and to receive the instructions of Wisdom.

Here is a winter's night proposed to be expected after this summer's day: Yet let this hearty old man remember the days of darkness_ for they shall be many. Note_ ,20250223
Here is an admonition both to old people and to young people_ to think of dying_ and get ready for it. Having by many excellent precepts taught us how to live well_ the preacher comes now_ towards the close of his discourse_ to teach us how to die well and to put us in mind of our latter end.,20250223
Here is an argument against a voluptuous luxurious life_ taken from the ruin it brings upon men's temporal interests. Here is 1. The description of an epicure: He loves pleasure. God allows us to use the delights of sense soberly and temperately_ wine to make glad the heart and put vigour into the spirits_ and oil to make the face to shine and beautify the countenance; but he that loves these_ that sets his heart upon them_ covets them earnestly_ is solicitous to have all the delights of sense wound up to the height of pleasurableness_ is impatient of every thing that crosses him in his pleasures_ relishes these as the best pleasures_ and has his mouth by them put out of taste for spiritual delights_ he is an epicure_ 2 Tim. iii. 4,20250223
Here is another sort of evil men described to us_ that we may neither do like them_ nor have any thing to do with them. 1. Such as (like Satan) do all the mischief they can by force and violence_ as roaring lions_ and not only by fraud and insinuation_ as subtle serpents: They are violent men_ that do all by rapine and oppression_ that shut their eyes_ meditating with the closest intention and application of mind to devise froward things_ to contrive how they may do the greatest mischief to their neighbour_ to do it effectually and yet securely to themselves; and then moving their lips_ giving the word of command to their agents_ they bring the evil to pass_ and accomplish the wicked device_ biting his lips (so some read it) for vexation. When the wicked plots against the just he gnasheth upon him with his teeth,20250223
Here is good advice for parents to give to their children; words are put into their mouths_ that they may train them up in the way they should go. Here we have_,20250223

Here is the description,20250223
Here is the description of an unprofitable_ slothful_ wicked servant_ a slave that serves not from conscience_ or love_ but purely from fear. Let those that have such servants put on patience to bear the vexation and not disturb themselves at it. See their character. 1. No rational words will work upon them; they will not be corrected and reformed_ not brought to their business_ nor cured of their idleness and laziness_ by fair means_ no_ nor by foul words; even the most gentle master will be forced to use severity with them; no reason will serve their turn_ for they are unreasonable,20250223
Here is the sin and punishment of an evil man. 1. His sin. He is an evil man indeed that seeks all occasions to rebel against God_ and the government God has set over him_ and to contradict and quarrel with those about him. Quærit jurgia—He picks quarrels; so some. There are some that are actuated by a spirit of opposition_ that will contradict for contradiction-sake_ that will go on frowardly in their wicked ways in spite of all restraint and check. A rebellious man seeks mischief (so some read it)_ watches all opportunities to disturb the public peace,20250223
Here is the vanity of man as mortal. He now comes to speak more generally concerning the estate of the sons of men in this world_ their life and being on earth_ and shows that their reason_ without religion and the fear of God_ advances them but little above the beasts. Now observe_,20250223
Here is_,20250223
Here is_ A caution not to abuse other people's servants any more than our own_ nor to make mischief between them and their masters_ for it is an ill office_ invidious_ and what will make a man odious_ v,20250223
Here is_ An account of the penman of this book; it was Solomon_ for no other son of David was king of Jerusalem; but he conceals his name Solomon_ peaceable_ because by his sin he had brought trouble upon himself and his kingdom_ had broken his peace with God and lost the peace of his conscience_ and therefore was no more worthy of that name. Call me not Solomon_ call me Marah_ for_ behold_ for peace I had great bitterness. But he calls himself_,20250223
Here is_ The humble petition which the spouse presents to her beloved_ the shepherdess to the shepherd_ the church and every believer to Christ_ for a more free and intimate communion with him. She turns from the daughters of Jerusalem_ to whom she had complained both of her sins and of her troubles_ and looks up to heaven for relief and succour against both_ v,20250223
Here observe,20250223
Here observe The title she gives to Christ: O thou whom my soul loveth. Note_ It is the undoubted character of all true believers that their souls love Jesus Christ_ which intimates both the sincerity and the strength of their love; they love him with all their hearts; and those that do so may come to him boldly and may humbly plead it with him,20250223
Here observe_ ,20250223
Here see,20250223
Here she repeats it as that which she resolved to abide by_ and which she took an unspeakable pleasure and satisfaction in; she liked her choice too well to change. Our communion with God is very much maintained and kept up by the frequent renewing of our covenant with him and rejoicing in it. ,20250223
Here the conference is carried on between Christ and his spouse_ and endearments are mutually exchanged.,20250223
Here we are taught,20250223
Here we have,20250223
Here we have the description and doom of an uncharitable man. 1. His description: He stops his ears at the cry of the poor_ at the cry of their wants and miseries (he resolves to take no cognizance of them)_ at the cry of their requests and supplications—he resolves he will not so much as give them the hearing_ turns them away from his door_ and forbids them to come near him_ or_ if he cannot avoid hearing them_ he will not need them_ nor be moved by their complaints_ no be prevailed with by their importunities; he shuts up the bowels of his compassion_ and that is equivalent to the stopping of his ears_ Acts vii. 57,20250223

Here_ The spouse commends her beloved and prefers him before all others: As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood_ which perhaps does not grow so high_ nor spread so wide_ as some other trees_ yet is useful and serviceable to man_ yielding pleasant and profitable fruit_ while the other trees are of little use_ no_ not the cedars themselves_ till they are cut down_ so is my beloved among the sons_ so far does he excel them all_—all the sons of God_ the angels (that honour was put upon him which was never designed for them_ Heb. i. 4)_—all the sons of men; he is fairer than them all_ fairer than the choicest of them_ Ps. xlv,20250223
Here_ as before_ Solomon laments the case of him that has a peevish passionate wife_ that is continually chiding_ and making herself and all about her uneasy. 1. It is a grievance that there is no avoiding_ for it is like a continual dropping in a very rainy day. The contentions of a neighbour may be like a sharp shower_ troublesome for the time_ yet_ while it lasts_ one may take shelter; but the contentions of a wife are like a constant soaking rain_ for which there is no remedy but patience See ch. xix. 13,20250223
Here_ as before_ men are judged of_ and_ accordingly_ are justified or condemned_ by their words_ Matt. xii,20250223
Hereby he prepared himself to get good by the affliction; for how can we improve the grief which we will not feel?,20250223
Herein Job was a type of Christ_ as many of the ancients make him: these very expressions are used in the predictions of his sufferings_ Ps. xxii. 13_ They gaped upon me with their mouths; and (Mic. v. 1)_ They shall smite the Judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek_ which was literally fulfilled_ Matt. xxvi. 67. How were those increased that troubled him!,20250223
Herein also Job was a type of Christ_ who was delivered into wicked hands_ to be crucified and slain_ by the determinate counsel and fore-knowledge of God_ Acts ii. 23.,20250223
Herein he seems to reflect upon what Job had said (ch. xiii. 14): Wherefore did I take my flesh in my teeth? __It is thy own fault___ says Bildad. Or he reflected upon what he said ch. xvi. 9_ where he seemed to charge it upon God_ or_ as some think_ upon Eliphaz: He teareth me in his wrath. __No___ says Bildad; __thou alone shalt bear it.__ He teareth himself in his anger. Note_ Anger is a sin that is its own punishment. Fretful passionate people tear and torment themselves. He teareth his soul (so the word is); every sin wounds the soul_ tears that_ wrongs that (Prov. viii. unbridled passion particularly.,20250223
Herein he was a type of Christ_ who_ in his sufferings_ complained most of the sufferings of his soul. Now is my soul troubled_ John xii,20250223
Herein_ perhaps_ he has an eye especially to Samson_ who was slain by this sin_ and perhaps to David too_ who by this sin entailed a sword upon his house_ though so far the Lord took it away that he himself should not die. These were men not only of great bodily strength_ but of eminent wisdom and courage_ and yet their fleshly lusts prevailed over them. Howl_ fir-trees_ if the cedars be shaken. Let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. ,20250223

High mettle is the praise of a horse rather than of a man_ whom fierceness and rage ill become. This description of the war-horse will help to explain that character which is given of presumptuous sinners_ Jer. viii,20250223
His agency in making the world. He not only had a being before the world_ but he was present_ not as a spectator_ but as the architect_ when the world was made. God silenced and humbled Job by asking him_ __Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Who hath laid the measures thereof? (Job xxxviii. 4_ &c.). Wast thou that eternal Word and wisdom_ who was the prime manager of that great affair? No; thou art of yesterday.__ But here the Son of God_ referring_ as it should seem_ to the discourse God had with Job_ declares himself to have been engaged in that which Job could not pretend to be a witness of and a worker in_ the creation of the world. By him God made the worlds_ Eph. iii. 9; Heb. i. 2; Col. i,20250223
His almighty power_ ver. 20_ 24,20250223
His back-bone is so strong that_ though his tail be not large_ yet he moves it like a cedar_ with a commanding force_ v,20250223
His bones (a horrid sight) start through his skin_ Which lay before_ in flesh and fat_ unseen.__,20250223
His bones_ compared with those of other creatures_ are like bars of iron_ v,20250223
His bowels are as bright ivory_ for so it should be rendered_ rather than his belly_ for it is the same word that was used for bowels,20250223
His cheeks (the rising of the face) are as a bed of spices_ raised in the gardens_ which are the beauty and wealth of them_ and as sweet flowers_ or towers of sweetness. There is that in Christ's countenance which is amiable in the eyes of all the saints_ in the least glimpse of him_ for the cheek is but a part of the face. The half discoveries Christ makes of himself to the soul are reviving and refreshing_ fragrant above the richest flowers and perfumes. ,20250223
His children were crushed_ v,20250223
His complaint of God as implacable and inexorable was by no means to be excused. It was the language of his corruption. He knew better_ and_ at another time_ would have been far from harbouring any such hard thoughts of God as now broke in upon his spirit and broke out in these passionate complaints. Good men do not always speak like themselves; but God_ who considers their frame and the strength of their temptations_ gives them leave afterwards to unsay what was amiss by repentance and will not lay it to their charge.,20250223
His complaint of his present uneasiness is excusable_ v. 27_ 28. 1. It should seem_ he did his endeavour to quiet and compose himself as his friends advised him. That was the good he would do: he would fain forget his complaints and praise God_ would leave off his heaviness and comfort himself_ that he might be fit for converse both with God and man; but_ 2. He found he could not do it: __I am afraid of all my sorrows. When I strive most against my trouble it prevails most over me and proves too hard for me!__ It is easier_ in such a case_ to know what we should do than to do it_ to know what temper we should be in than to get into that temper and keep in it. It is easy to preach patience to those that are in trouble_ and to tell them they must forget their complaints and comfort themselves; but it is not so soon done as said. Fear and sorrow are tyrannizing things_ not easily brought into the subjection they ought to be kept in to religion and right reason. But_,20250223
His condition during that continuance. Man's life is a warfare_ and as the days of a hireling. We are every one of us to look upon ourselves in this world_ ,20250223
His condition would have been as good as that of the best: I would have been (says he_ v. 14) with kings and counsellors of the earth_ whose pomp_ power_ and policy_ cannot set them out of the reach of death_ nor secure them from the grave_ nor distinguish theirs from common dust in the grave. Even princes_ who had gold in abundance_ could not with it bribe Death to overlook them when he came with commission; and_ though they filled their houses with silver_ yet they were forced to leave it all behind them_ no more to return to it. Some_ by the desolate places which the kings and counsellors are here said to build for themselves_ understand the sepulchres or monuments they prepared for themselves in their life-time; as Shebna (Isa. xxii. 16) hewed himself out a sepulchre; and by the gold which the princes had_ and the silver with which they filled their houses_ they understand the treasures which_ they say_ it was usual to deposit in the graves of great men. Such arts have been used to preserve their dignity_ if possible_ on the other side death_ and to keep themselves from lying even with those of inferior rank; but it will not do: death is_ and will be_ an irresistible leveller. Mors sceptra ligonibus æquat—Death mingles sceptres with spades. Rich and poor meet together in the grave; and there a hidden untimely birth (v. a child that either never saw light or but just opened its eyes and peeped into the world_ and_ not liking it_ closed them again and hastened out of it_ lies as soft and easy_ lies as high and safe_ as kings and counsellors_ and princes_ that had gold. __And therefore___ says Job_ __would I had lain there in the dust_ rather than to lie here in the ashes!__ 2. His condition would have been much better than now it was (v. 13): __Then should I have lain still_ and been quiet_ which now I cannot do_ I cannot be_ but am still tossing and unquiet; then I should have slept_ whereas now sleep departeth from my eyes; then had I been at rest_ whereas now I am restless.__ Now that life and immortality are brought to a much clearer light by the gospel than before they were placed in good Christians can give a better account than this of the gain of death: __Then should I have been present with the Lord; then should I have seen his glory face to face_ and no longer through a glass darkly.__ But all that poor Job dreamed of was rest and quietness in the grave out of the fear of evil tidings and out of the feeling of sore boils. Then should I have been quiet; and had he kept his temper_ his even easy temper still_ which he was in as recorded in the two foregoing chapters_ entirely resigned to the holy will of God and acquiescing in it_ he might have been quiet now; his soul_ at least_ might have dwelt at ease_ even when his body lay in pain_ Ps. xxv,20250223
His confession of faith_ ver. 1-6.,20250223
His continuance in that place. Is there not a time appointed for his abode here? Yes_ certainly there is_ and it is easy to say by whom the appointment is made_ even by him that made us and set us here. We are not to be on this earth always_ nor long_ but for a certain time_ which is determined by him in whose hand our times are. We are not to think that we are governed by the blind fortune of the Epicureans_ but by the wise_ holy_ and sovereign counsel of God,20250223
His countenance (his port and mien) is as Lebanon_ that stately hill; his aspect beautiful and charming_ like the prospect of that pleasant forest or park_ excellent as the cedars_ which_ in height and strength_ excel other trees_ and are of excellent use. Christ is a goodly person; the more we look upon him the more beauty we shall see in him. ,20250223
His dairy abounded to such a degree that he might_ if he pleased_ wash his steps with butter; and his olive-yards were so fruitful_ beyond expectation_ that it seemed as if the rock poured him out rivers of oil. He reckons his wealth_ not by his silver and gold_ which were for hoarding_ but by his butter and oil_ which were for use; for what is an estate good for unless we take the good of it ourselves and do good with it to others?,20250223
His demonstration of God's sovereignty and omnipotence_ which he gives instances of in the operations of common providence_ and which is a reason why we should all submit to him in his dealings with us_ ver. 22-33. This he prosecutes and enlarges upon in the following chapter.,20250223
His discourse is designed for the convincing of their judgments and the rectifying of their mistakes. He owns that God does sometimes hang up a wicked man as it were in chains_ in terrorem—as a terror to others_ by some visible remarkable judgment in this life_ but denies that he always does so; nay_ he maintains that commonly he does otherwise_ suffering even the worst of sinners to live all their days in prosperity and to go out of the world without any visible mark of his wrath upon them. 1. He describes the great prosperity of wicked people_ ver. 7-13,20250223
His discourse is long_ and all upon one subject_ the very same that Bildad was large upon (ch. xviii.)_ the certain misery of wicked people and the ruin that awaits them. 1. He asserts_ in general_ that the prosperity of a wicked person is short_ and his ruin sure_ ver. 4-9,20250223
His doom. He shall himself be reduced to straits_ which will make him cry_ and then he shall not be heard. Men will not hear him_ but reward him as he has rewarded others. God will not hear him; for he that showed no mercy shall have judgment without mercy (Jam. ii. and he that on earth denied a crumb of bread in hell was denied a drop of water. God will be deaf to the prayers of those who are deaf to the cries of the poor_ which_ if they be not heard by us_ will be heard against us_ Exod. xxii. 23.,20250223
His estate strangely increased_ by the blessing of God upon the little that his friends gave him. He thankfully received their courtesy_ and did not think it below him to have his estate repaired by contributions. He did not_ on the one hand_ urge his friends to raise money for him; he acquits himself from that (ch. vi.,20250223
His estate was plundered_ v,20250223
His estate will be sunk. His goods shall flow away from his family as fast as ever they flowed into it_ when the day of God's wrath comes_ for which_ all the while his estate was in the getting by fraud and oppression_ he was treasuring up wrath.,20250223
His eternity; he was begotten of the Father_ for the Lord possessed him_ as his own Son_ his beloved Son_ laid him in his bosom; he was brought forth as the only-begotten of the Father_ and this before all worlds_ which is most largely insisted upon here. The Word was eternal_ and had a being before the world_ before the beginning of time; and therefore it must follow that it was from eternity. The Lord possessed him in the beginning of his way_ of his eternal counsels_ for those were before his works. This way indeed had no beginning_ for God's purposes in himself are eternal like himself_ but God speaks to us in our own language. Wisdom explains herself (v. 23): I was set up from everlasting. The Son of God was_ in the eternal counsels of God_ designed and advanced to be the wisdom and power of the Father_ light and life_ and all in all both in the creation and in the redemption of the world. That he was brought forth as to his being_ and set up as to the divine counsels concerning his office_ before the world was made_ is here set forth in a great variety of expressions_ much the same with those by which the eternity of God himself is expressed. Ps. xc. 2_ Before the mountains were brought forth. 1. Before the earth was_ and that was made in the beginning_ before man was made; therefore the second Adam had a being before the first_ for the first Adam was made of the earth_ the second had a being before the earth_ and therefore is not of the earth_ John iii. 31,20250223
His examination_ how he came thither (v. 7): The Lord said unto Satan_ Whence comest thou? He knew very well whence he came_ and with what design he came thither_ that as the good angels came to do good he came for a permission to do hurt; but he would_ by calling him to an account_ show him that he was under check and control. Whence comest thou? He asks this,20250223
His expectations from them_ which their coming so solemnly to comfort him had raised_ he compares to the expectation which the weary thirsty travellers have of finding water in the summer where they have often seen it in great abundance in the winter_ v,20250223
His eye anticipates more than he can take; for_ when he is very thirsty_ having been long kept without water_ he trusts that he can drink up Jordan in his mouth_ and even takes it with his eyes_ v,20250223
His eyes are as the eyes of doves_ fair and clear_ and chaste and kind_ by the rivers of waters_ which doves delight in_ and in which_ as in a glass_ they see themselves. They are washed_ to make them clean_ washed with milk_ to make them white_ and fitly set_ neither starting out nor sunk in. Christ is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity_ for they are doves' eyes_ Hab. i,20250223
His face was furrowed_ not with age_ but sickness: Thou hast filled me with wrinkles. His flesh was wasted with the running of his sore boils_ so that his leanness rose up in him_ that is_ his bones_ that before were not seen_ stuck out_ ch. xxxiii,20250223
His falling out with this business. He soon grew weary of it. 1. He hated all his labour_ because he did not meet with that satisfaction in which he expected. After he had had his fine houses_ and gardens_ and water-works_ awhile_ he began to nauseate them_ and look upon them with contempt_ as children_ who are eager for a toy and fond of it at first_ but_ when they have played with it awhile_ are weary of it_ and throw it away_ and must have another. This expresses not a gracious hatred of these things_ which is our duty_ to love them less than God and religion (Luke nor a sinful hatred of them_ which is our folly_ to be weary of the place God has assigned us and the work of it_ but a natural hatred of them_ arising from a surfeit upon them and a sense of disappointment in them,20250223
His family might justly be made infamous in the highest degree (v. 10): Let my wife grind to another. Let her be a slave (so some)_ a harlot_ so others. God often punishes the sins of one with the sin of another_ the adultery of the husband with the adultery of the wife_ as in David's case (2 Sam. xii. which does not in the least excuse the treachery of the adulterous wife; but_ how unrighteous soever she is_ God is righteous. See Hos. iv. 13_ Your spouses shall commit adultery. Note_ Those who are not just and faithful to their relations must not think it strange if their relations be unjust and unfaithful to them. ,20250223
His friends come to condole with him and to comfort him_ ver. 11-13. And in this that good man is set forth for an example of suffering affliction and of patience.,20250223
His friends were ready enough to tell him how numerous and how heinous they were_ ch. xxii,20250223
His good opinion of himself is the cause of his slothfulness; he will not take pains to get wisdom because he thinks he is wise enough already. A conceit of the sufficiency of our attainments is a great enemy to our improvement. ,20250223
His great care about his children is taken notice of as an instance of his piety: for that we are really which we are relatively. Those that are good will be good to their children_ and especially do what they can for the good of their souls. Observe (v. 5) Job's pious concern for the spiritual welfare of his children_,20250223
His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl_ a noted precious stone_ v,20250223
His having dominion (or being Dominus—Lord) bespeaks him both owner and ruler of all the creatures. They are all his_ and they are all under his direction and at his disposal. Hence it follows that he is to be feared (that is_ reverenced and obeyed)_ that he is feared by all that know him (the seraphim cover their faces before him)_ and that_ first or last_ all will be made to fear him. Men's dominion is often despicable_ often despised_ but God is always terrible. ,20250223
His head and his body are well set together. Sorrow rejoices (or rides in triumph) before him_ for he makes terrible work wherever he comes. Or_ Those storms which are the sorrow of others are his joys; what is tossing to others is dancing to him. His flesh is well knit_ v,20250223
His head is as the most fine gold. The head of Christ is God (1 Cor. xi. and it is promised to the saints that the Almighty shall be their gold (Job xxii. their defence_ their treasure; much more was he so to Christ_ in whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily_ Col. ii,20250223
His heart did not walk after his eyes_ that is_ he did not covet what he saw that was another's_ nor wish it his own. Covetousness is called the lust of the eye_ 1 John ii,20250223
His heart is as firm as a stone_ v,20250223
His hope_ he thought_ would in the issue be turned into joy; but this is the issue_ this is the joy. The harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow_ Isa. xvii,20250223
His inward peace is continually disturbed. He seems to those about him to be easy_ and they therefore envy him and wish themselves in his condition; but he who knows what is in men tells us that a wicked man has so little comfort and satisfaction in his own breast that he is rather to be pitied than envied. First_ His own conscience accuses him_ and with the pangs and throes of that he travaileth in pain all his days_ v,20250223
His judgment of them_ that all is vanity_ ver,20250223
His knowledge is intuitive: he sees_ and does not know by report. It is intimate and entire: he knows things truly_ and not by their colours—thoroughly_ and not by piecemeal. To his knowledge there is nothing distant_ but all near—nothing future_ but all present—nothing hid_ but all open. We ought to acknowledge this in all his wondrous works_ and it is sufficient to satisfy us in those wondrous works which we know not the meaning of that they are the works of one that knows what he does.,20250223
His legs are as pillars of marble_ so strong_ and stately_ and no disgrace_ no_ not to the sockets of fine gold upon which they are set_ v,20250223
His light will certainly be put out at length_ quite put out_ so that not the least spark of it shall remain with which to kindle another fire. Even while he is in his tabernacle_ while he is in the body_ which is the tabernacle of the soul (2 Cor. v. 1)_ the light shall be dark; he shall have no true solid comfort_ no joy that is satisfying_ no hope that is supporting. Even the light that is in him is darkness; and how great is that darkness! But_ when he is put out of this tabernacle by death_ his candle shall be put out with him. The period of his life will be the final period of all his days and will turn all his hopes into endless despair. When a wicked man dies his expectation shall perish_ Prov. xi,20250223
His lips are like lilies_ not white like lilies_ but sweet and pleasant. Such are the words of his lips to all that are sanctified_ sweeter than honey and the honey-comb; such are the kisses of his lips_ all the communications of his grace; grace is poured into his lips_ and those that heard him wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. His lips are as lilies_ dropping sweet-smelling myrrh. Never any lilies in nature dropped myrrh_ but nothing in nature can fully set forth the beauty and excellence of Christ_ and therefore_ to do it by comparison_ there must be a composition of images. ,20250223
His locks are bushy and black_ not black as the tents of Kedar_ whose blackness was their deformity_ to which therefore the church compares herself (ch. i. but black as a raven_ whose blackness is his beauty. Sometimes Christ's hair is represented as white (Rev. i. denoting his eternity_ that he is the ancient of days; but here as black and bushy_ denoting that he is ever young and that there is in him no decay_ nothing that waxes old. Every thing that belongs to Christ is amiable in the eyes of a believer_ even his hair is so; it was pity that it should be wet_ as it was_ with the dew_ and these locks with the drops of the night_ while he waited to be gracious_ v,20250223
His memory falls under the just indignation of all mankind (v. 23): Men shall clap their hands at him_ that is_ they shall rejoice in the judgments of God_ by which he is cut off_ and be well pleased in his fall. When the wicked perish there is shouting_ Prov. xi,20250223
His mouth is most sweet; it is sweetness itself; it is sweetnesses (so the word is); it is pure essence_ nay_ it is the quintessence of all delights_ v,20250223
His nights were wearisome_ and_ instead of taking any rest_ he did but tire himself more with tossing to and fro until morning. Those that are in great uneasiness_ through pain of body or anguish of mind_ think by changing sides_ changing places_ changing postures_ to get some ease; but_ while the cause is the same within_ it is all to no purpose; it is but a resemblance of a fretful discontented spirit_ that is ever shifting_ but never easy. This made him dread the night as much as the servant desires it_ and_ when he lay down_ to say_ When will the night be gone? ,20250223
His nose has in it strength enough for both; for_ when he goes greedily to drink with it_ he pierces through snares or nets_ which perhaps are laid in the waters to catch fish. He makes nothing of the difficulties that lie in his way_ so great is his strength and so eager his appetite.,20250223
His observance. __He not only sees_ but takes notice; he counts all my steps_ all my false steps in the way of duty_ all my by-steps into the way of sin.__ He not only sees our ways in general_ but takes cognizance of our particular steps in these ways_ every action_ every motion. He keeps account of all_ because he will call us to account_ will bring every work into judgment. God takes a more exact notice of us than we do of ourselves; for who ever counted his own steps? yet God counts them. Let us therefore walk circumspectly.,20250223
His old acquaintance_ neighbours_ and relations_ were very kind to him_ v,20250223
His omniscience_ ver. 21_ 22_ 25,20250223
His other servants never heeded him; if he called to them they would not come at his call_ but pretended that they did not hear him. If he asked them a question_ they would not vouchsafe to give him an answer_ v,20250223
His outward prosperity will soon come to an end_ and all his confidence and all his comfort will come to an end with it. How can he prosper when God runs upon him? so some understand that_ v,20250223
His own covetous mind keeps him from being truly rich. He is not rich that has not enough_ and he has not enough that does not think he has. It is contentment only that is great gain. Providence remarkably keeps some from being rich_ defeating their enterprises_ breaking their measures_ and keeping them always behind-hand. Many that get much by fraud and injustice_ yet do not grow rich: it goes as it comes; it is got by one sin and spent upon another. Secondly_ He is in care to keep what he has got_ but in vain: His substance shall not continue; it will dwindle and come to nothing. God blasts it_ and what came up in a night perishes in a night. Wealth gotten by vanity will certainly be diminished. Some have themselves lived to see the ruin of those estates which have been raised by oppression; but_ where this is not the case_ that which is left goes with a curse to those who succeed. De male quæsitis vix gaudet tertius hæres—Ill-gotten property will scarcely be enjoyed by the third generation. He purchases estates to him and his heirs for ever; but to what purpose? He shall not prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth; neither the credit nor the comfort of his riches shall be prolonged; and_ when those are gone_ where is the perfection of them? How indeed can we expect the perfection of any thing to be prolonged upon the earth_ where every thing is transitory_ and we soon see the end of all perfection? Thirdly_ He is in care to leave what he has got and kept to his children after him. But in this he is crossed; the branches of his family shall perish_ in whom he hoped to live and flourish and to have the reputation of making them all great men. They shall not be green_ v,20250223
His own servants slighted him. His maids did not attend him in his illness_ but counted him for a stranger and an alien_ v,20250223
His parents loved him_ and therefore taught him: I was my father's son. David had many sons_ but Solomon was his son indeed_ as Isaac is called (Gen. xvii. 19) and for the same reason_ because on him the covenant was entailed. He was his father's darling_ above any of his children. God had a special kindness for Solomon (the prophet called him Jedidiah_ because the Lord loved him_ 2 Sam. xii. and for that reason David had a special kindness for him_ for he was a man after God's own heart. If parents may ever love one child better than another_ it must not be till it plainly appears that God does so. He was tender_ and only beloved_ in the sight of his mother. Surely there was a manifest reason for making such a distinction when both the parents made it. Now we see how they showed their love; they catechised him_ kept him to his book_ and held him to a strict discipline. Though he was a prince_ and heir-apparent to the crown_ yet they did not let him live at large; nay_ therefore they tutored him thus. And perhaps David was the more strict with Solomon in his education because he had seen the ill effects of an undue indulgence in Adonijah_ whom he had not crossed in any thing (1 Kings as also in Absalom. ,20250223
His prayer_ ver. 7-9.,20250223
His prayers are accepted. God will be favourable to him_ and be well pleased with him; his anger shall be turned away from him_ and the light of God's countenance shall shine upon his soul; and then it follows_ ,20250223

His preface is short_ but hot_ ver. 2_ 3.,20250223
His preface_ ver. 2-4.,20250223
His present miseries_ which God had brought him into notwithstanding his integrity_ gave him too sensible a conviction that_ in the ordering and disposing of men's outward condition in this world_ God acts by sovereignty_ and_ though he never does wrong to any_ yet he does not ever give full right to all (that is_ the best do not always fare best_ nor the worst fare worst) in this life_ because he reserves the full and exact distribution of rewards and punishments for the future state. Job was not conscious to himself of any extraordinary guilt_ and yet fell under extraordinary afflictions_ v. 17_ 18. Every man must expect the wind to blow upon him and ruffle him_ but Job was broken with a tempest. Every man_ in the midst of these thorns and briers_ must expect to be scratched; but Job was wounded_ and his wounds were multiplied. Every man must expect a cross daily_ and to taste sometimes of the bitter cup; but poor Job's troubles came so thickly upon him that he had no breathing time_ and he was filled with bitterness. And he presumes to say that all this was without cause_ without any great provocation given. We have made the best of what Job said hitherto_ though contrary to the judgment of many good interpreters; but here_ no doubt_ he spoke unadvisedly with his lips; he reflected on God's goodness in saying that he was not suffered to take his breath (while yet he had such good use of his reason and speech as to be able to talk thus) and on his justice in saying that it was without cause. Yet it is true that as_ on the one hand_ there are many who are chargeable with more sin than the common infirmities of human nature_ and yet feel no more sorrow than that of the common calamities of human life_ so_ on the other hand_ there are many who feel more than the common calamities of human life and yet are conscious to themselves of no more than the common infirmities of human nature. ,20250223
His pride and security were the certain presages of his misery. This will certainly be true of all impenitent sinners in the other world; they shall be undone_ for ever undone. But Zophar means his ruin in this world; and indeed sometimes notorious sinners are remarkably cut off by present judgments; they have reason enough to fear what Zophar here threatens even the triumphant sinner with. ,20250223
His providence extends itself to all: Upon whom does not his light arise? The light of the sun is communicated to all parts of the world_ and_ take the year round_ to all equally. See Ps. xix,20250223
His punishment. Because he will not be reclaimed by mild and gentle methods_ a cruel messenger shall be sent against him_ some dreadful judgment or other_ as a messenger from God. Angels_ God's messengers_ shall be employed as ministers of his justice against him_ Ps. lxxviii,20250223
His repeated commendation of the beauty of the spouse (v. 7): Thou art all fair_ my love. He had said (v. 1)_ Thou art fair; but here he goes further_ and_ in review of the particulars_ as of those of the creation_ he pronounces all very good: __Thou art all fair_ my love; thou art all over beautiful_ and there is nothing amiss in thee_ and thou hast all beauties in thee; thou art sanctified wholly in every part; all things have become new (2 Cor. v. 17); there is not only a new face and a new name_ but a new man_ a new nature; there is no spot in thee_ as far as thou art renewed.__ The spiritual sacrifices must be without blemish. There is no spot but such as is often the spot of God's children_ none of the leopard's spots. The church_ when Christ shall present it to himself a glorious church_ will be altogether without spot or wrinkle_ Eph. v. 27.,20250223
His scales are his beauty and strength_ and therefore his pride_ v. 15-17. The crocodile is indeed remarkable for his scales; if we understand it of the whale_ we must understand by these shields (for so the word is) the several coats of his skin; or there might be whales in that country with scales. That which is remarkable concerning the scales is that they stick so close together_ by which he is not only kept warm_ for no air can pierce him_ but kept safe_ for no sword can pierce him through those scales. Fishes_ that live in the water_ are fortified accordingly by the wisdom of Providence_ which gives clothes as it gives cold. ,20250223
His severity against sinners_ ver. 26-28.,20250223
His sheep_ with which especially he used to honour God in sacrifice_ were all taken from him_ as if God were angry at his offerings and would punish him in those very things which he had employed in his service. Having misrepresented Job to God as a false servant_ in pursuance of his old design to set Heaven and earth at variance_ he here misrepresented God to Jacob as a hard Master_ who would not protect those flocks out of which he had so many burnt-offerings. This would tempt Job to say_ It is in vain to serve God. ,20250223
His sinful projects and pursuits bring him into mischief. He is cast into a net by his own feet (v. runs upon his own destruction_ is snared in the work of his own hands (Ps. ix.,20250223
His size is prodigious_ and therefore he must have supply accordingly_ v,20250223
His slothfulness is the cause of his good opinion of himself. If he would but take pains to examine himself_ and compare himself with the laws of wisdom_ he would have other thoughts of himself. Indulged slothfulness is at the bottom of prevailing self-conceitedness. Nay_ ,20250223
His sores bred worms_ the scabs were like clods of dust_ and his skin was broken; so evil was the disease which cleaved fast to him. See what vile bodies we have_ and what little reason we have to pamper them or be proud of them; they have in themselves the principles of their own corruption: as fond as we are of them now_ the time may come when we may loathe them and long to get rid of them.,20250223
His soul falls under the just indignation of God_ and it is the terror of that indignation which puts him into such amazement at the approach of death (v. 22): For God shall cast upon him and not spare. While he lived he had the benefit of sparing mercy; but now the day of God's patience is over_ and he will not spare_ but pour out upon him the full vials of his wrath. What God casts down upon a man there is no flying from nor bearing up under. We read of his casting down great stones from heaven upon the Canaanites (Josh. x. which made terrible execution among them; but what was that to his casting down his anger in its full weight upon the sinner's conscience_ like the talent of lead? Zech. v. 7_ 8. The damned sinner_ seeing the wrath of God break in upon him_ would fain flee out of his hand; but he cannot: the gates of hell are locked and barred_ and the great gulf fixed_ and it will be in vain to call for the shelter of rocks and mountains. Those who will not be persuaded now to fly to the arms of divine grace_ which are stretched out to receive them_ will not be able to flee from the arms of divine wrath_ which will shortly be stretched out to destroy them. ,20250223
His soul recovers it peace_ v,20250223
His sovereign dominion_ ver. 13-15,20250223
His steps never turned out of the way_ the way of justice and fair dealing; from that he never deviated_ v,20250223
His thoughts and cares about it_ and that close and constant application of mind which was requisite to it_ were a burden and fatigue to him_ especially when he grew old. It is the effect of a curse on that we are to work upon. Our business is said to be the work and toil of our hands_ because of the ground which the Lord had cursed (Gen. v. 29) and of the weakening of the faculties we are to work with_ and of the sentence pronounced on us_ that in the sweat of our face we must eat bread. Our labour is called the vexation of our heart (v. 22); it is to most a force upon themselves_ so natural is it to us to love our ease. A man of business is described to be uneasy both in his going out and his coming in_ v,20250223
His troubles began in Satan's malice_ which God restrained; his restoration began in God's mercy_ which Satan could not oppose. Job's sorest complaint_ and indeed the sorrowful accent of all his complaints_ on which he laid the greatest emphasis_ was that God appeared against him. But now God plainly appeared for him_ and watched over him to build and to plant_ like as he had (at least in his apprehension) watched over him to pluck up and to throw down_ Jer. xxxi,20250223
His very motion in the water troubles it and puts it into a ferment_ v. 31_ 32. When he rolls_ and tosses_ and makes a stir in the water_ or is in pursuit of his prey_ he makes the deep to boil like a pot_ he raises a great froth and foam upon the water_ such as is upon a boiling pot_ especially a pot of boiling ointment; and he makes a path to shine after him_ which even a ship in the midst of the sea does not_ Prov. xxx,20250223
His whole work is so. God does nothing mean. This is a good reason why we should acquiesce in all the operations of his providence concerning us in particular. His visible works_ those of nature_ and which concern the world in general_ are such as we admire and commend_ and in which we observe the Creator's wisdom_ power_ and goodness; shall we then find fault with his dispensations concerning us_ and the counsels of his will concerning our affairs? We are here called to consider the work of God_ Eccl. vii,20250223
His wife tempts him to curse God_ but he resists the temptation_ ver. 9_ 10.,20250223
Hitherto God had put such questions to Job as were proper to convince him of his ignorance and short-sightedness. Now he comes_ in the same manner_ to show his impotency and weakness. As it is but little that he knows_ and therefore he ought not to arraign the divine counsels_ so it is but little that he can do_ and therefore he ought not to oppose the proceedings of Providence. Let him consider what great things God does_ and try whether he can do the like_ or whether he thinks himself an equal match for him.,20250223
Hitherto we have been in the porch or preface to the proverbs_ here they begin. They are short but weighty sentences; most of them are distichs_ two sentences in one verse_ illustrating each other; but it is seldom that there is any coherence between the verses_ much less any thread of discourse_ and therefore in these chapters we need not attempt to reduce the contents to their proper heads_ the several sentences will appear best in their own places. The scope of them all is to set before us good and evil_ the blessing and the curse. Many of the proverbs in this chapter relate to the good government of the tongue_ without which men's religion is vain.,20250223
Holy fear is an excellent guard upon every holy thing_ and against every thing that is unholy. It is wisdom to depart from evil_ from the evil of sin_ and thereby from all other evil; and therefore it is wisdom to fear_ that is_ to be jealous over ourselves with a godly jealousy_ to keep up a dread of God's wrath_ to be afraid of coming near the borders of sin or dallying with the beginnings of it. A wise man_ for fear of harm_ keeps out of harm's way_ and starts back in a fright when he finds himself entering into temptation,20250223
Holy love is a fire that begets a vehement heat in the soul_ and consumes the dross and chaff that are in it_ melts it down like wax into a new form_ and carries it upwards as the sparks towards God and heaven.,20250223
Honesty defeating the design and escaping the snare: Through knowledge of the devices of Satan shall the just be delivered from the snares which the hypocrite has laid for him; seducers shall not deceive the elect. By the knowledge of God_ and the scriptures_ and their own hearts_ shall the just be delivered from those that lie in wait to deceive_ and so to destroy_ Rom. xvi. 18_ 19.,20250223

House-breakers_,20250223
How Christ is accounted of by all believers: He is a bundle of myrrh and a cluster of camphire_ something_ we may be sure_ nay_ every thing_ that is pleasant and delightful. The doctrine of his gospel_ and the comforts of his Spirit_ are very refreshing to them_ and they rest in his love; none of all the delights of sense are comparable to the spiritual pleasure they have in meditating on Christ and enjoying him. There is a complicated sweetness in Christ and an abundance of it; there is a bundle of myrrh and a cluster of camphire. We are not straitened in him whom there is all fulness. The word translated camphire is copher_ the same word that signifies atonement or propitiation. Christ is a cluster of merit and righteousness to all believers; therefore he is dear to them because he is the propitiation for their sins. Observe what stress the spouse lays upon the application: He is unto me_ and again unto me_ all that is sweet; whatever he is to others_ he is so to me. He loved me_ and gave himself for me. He is my Lord_ and my God. ,20250223
How Elihu solves the difficulty. If the cries of the oppressed be not heard_ the fault is not in God; he is ready to hear and help them. But the fault is in themselves; they ask and have not_ but it is because they ask amiss_ James iv,20250223
How Elihu was himself affected_ and desired to affect Job_ with the appearance of God's glory in the thunder and lightning (v. 1_ 2): __For my part___ says Elihu_ __my heart trembles at it; though I have often heard it_ often seen it_ yet it is still terrible to me_ and makes every joint of me tremble_ and my heart beat as if it would move out of its place.__ Thunder and lightning have been dreadful to the wicked: the emperor Caligula would run into a corner_ or under a bed_ for fear of them. Those who are very much astonished_ we say_ are thunder-struck. Even good people think thunder and lightning very awful; and that which makes them the more terrible is the hurt often done by lightning_ many having been killed by it. Sodom and Gomorrah were laid in ruins by it. It is a sensible indication of what God could do to this sinful world_ and what he will do_ at last_ by the fire to which it is reserved. Our hearts_ like Elihu's should tremble at it for fear of God's judgments_ Ps. cxix. 120. He also calls upon Job to attend to it (v. 2): Hear attentively the noise of his voice. Perhaps as yet it thundered at a distance_ and could not be heard without listening: or rather_ Though the thunder will be heard_ and whatever we are doing we cannot help attending to it_ yet_ to apprehend and understand the instructions God thereby gives us_ we have need to hear with great attention and application of mind. Thunder is called the voice of the Lord (Ps. xxix. 3_ &c.)_ because by it God speaks to the children of men to fear before him_ and it should put us in mind of that mighty word by which the world was at first made_ which is called thunder. Ps. civ. 7_ At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away_ namely_ the waters_ when God said_ Let them be gathered into one place. Those that are themselves affected with God's greatness should labour to affect others,20250223
How Heaven regards the foolish saint below.,20250223
How Job is commended for his constancy notwithstanding the attacks made upon him: __Still he holds fast his integrity_ as his weapon_ and thou canst not disarm him—as his treasure_ and thou canst not rob him of that; nay_ thy endeavours to do it make him hold it the faster; instead of losing ground by the temptation_ he gets ground.__ God speaks of it with wonder_ and pleasure_ and something of triumph in the power of his own grace; Still he holds fast his integrity. Thus the trial of Job's faith was found to his praise and honour_ 1 Pet. i,20250223
How Satan is condemned for his allegations against Job: __Thou movedst me against him_ as an accuser_ to destroy him without cause.__ Or_ __Thou in vain movedst me to destroy him_ for I will never do that.__ Good men_ when they are cast down_ are not destroyed_ 2 Cor. iv,20250223
How a good man's estate lasts: He leaves an inheritance to his children's children. It is part of his praise that he is thoughtful for posterity_ that he does not lay all out upon himself_ but is in care to do well for those that come after him_ not by withholding more than is meet_ but by a prudent and decent frugality. He trains up his children to this_ that they may leave it to their children; and especially he is careful_ both by justice and charity_ to obtain the blessing of God upon what he has_ and to entail that blessing upon his children_ without which the greatest industry and frugality will be in vain: A good man_ by being good and doing good_ by honouring the Lord with his substance and spending it in his service_ secures it to his posterity; or_ if he should not leave them much of this world's goods_ his prayers_ his instructions_ his good example_ will be the best entail_ and the promises of the covenant will be an inheritance to his children's children_ Ps. ciii. 17,20250223
How a great estate may be ruined by indiscretion: There is that has a great deal_ but it is destroyed and brought to nothing for want of judgment_ that is_ prudence in the management of it. Men over-build themselves or over-buy themselves_ keep greater company_ or a better table_ or more servants_ than they can afford_ suffer what they have to go to decay and do not make the most of it; by taking up money themselves_ or being bound for others_ their estates are sunk_ their families reduced_ and all for want of judgment.,20250223
How a small estate may be improved by industry_ so that a man_ by making the best of every thing_ may live comfortably upon it: Much food is in the tillage of the poor_ the poor farmers_ that have but a little_ but take pains with that little and husband it well. Many make it an excuse for their idleness that they have but a little to work on_ a very little to be doing with; but the less compass the field is of the more let the skill and labour of the owner be employed about it_ and it will turn to a very good account. Let him dig_ and he needs not beg,20250223
How acceptable such good news will be when it does come_ as refreshing as cold water to one that is thirsty. Solomon himself had much trading abroad_ as well as correspondence by his ambassadors with foreign courts; and how pleasant it was to hear of the good success of his negotiations abroad he well knew by experience. Heaven is a country afar off; how refreshing is it to hear good news thence_ both in the everlasting gospel_ which signified glad tidings_ and in the witness of the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children.,20250223
How affectionately he speaks to her: O thou fairest among women! Note_ Believing souls are fair_ in the eyes of the Lord Jesus_ above any other. Christ sees a beauty in holiness_ whether we do or no. The spouse has called herself black_ but Christ calls her fair. Those that are low in their own eyes are so much the more amiable in the eyes of Jesus Christ. Blushing at their own deformity (says Mr. Durham) is a chief part of their beauty,20250223
How apt fools are at every turn to proclaim their own folly_ and expose themselves; he that is either witless or graceless_ either silly or wicked_ if he be ever so little from under the check_ and left to himself_ if he but walk by the way_ soon shows what he is; his wisdom fails him_ and_ by some impropriety or other_ he says to every one he meets that he is a fool (v. that is_ he discovers his folly as plainly as if he had told them so. He cannot conceal it_ and he is not ashamed of it. Sin is the reproach of sinners wherever they go.,20250223
How can I do it_ and sin against God? Two things Job had an eye to:—,20250223
How can he be clean that is born of a woman? Clean children cannot come from unclean parents any more than pure streams from an impure spring or grapes from thorns. Our habitual corruption is derived with our nature from our parents_ and is therefore bred in the bone. Our blood is not only attainted by a legal conviction_ but tainted with an hereditary disease. Our Lord Jesus_ being made sin for us_ is said to be made of a woman_ Gal. iv. 4.,20250223
How cautious young people should be that they be not seduced by them: __Consent thou not; and then_ though they entice thee_ they cannot force thee. Do not say as they say_ nor do as they do or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them.__ To enforce this caution_,20250223
How clear he was from this sin_ v,20250223
How closely he gives to Satan this good character of Job: Hast thou set thy heart to my servant Job? designing hereby_ ,20250223
How dreadful the agonies of death are (v. 22): While his flesh is upon him (so it may be read)_ that is_ the body he is so loth to lay down_: it shall have pain; and while his soul is within him_ that is_ the spirit he is so loth to resign_ it shall mourn. Note_ Dying work is hard work; dying pangs are_ commonly_ sore pangs. It is folly therefore for men to defer their repentance to a death-bed_ and to have that to do which is the one thing needful when they are really unfit to do any thing: but it is true wisdom by making our peace with God in Christ and keeping a good conscience_ to treasure up comforts which will support and relieve us against the pains and sorrows of a dying hour.,20250223
How evidently it is proved by two arguments: 1. His independent absolute sovereignty and dominion (v. 13): Who has given him a charge over the earth and deputed him to manage the affairs of men upon the earth? Or_ Who besides has disposed the whole world of mankind? He has the sole administration of the kingdoms of men_ and has it of himself_ nor is he entrusted with it by or for any other. ,20250223
How false she is. Who will have any dealings with those that are made up of treachery? She is a strange woman; for_ First_ She is false to him whom she entices. She speaks fair_ tells him how much she admires him above any man_ and what a kindness she has for him; but she flatters with her words; she has no true affection for him_ nor any desire of his welfare_ any more than Delilah had of Samson's. All she designs is to pick his pocket and gratify a base lust of her own. Secondly_ She is false to her husband_ and violates the sacred obligation she lies under to him. He was the guide of her youth; by marrying him she chose him to be so_ and submitted herself to his guidance_ with a promise to attend him only_ and forsake all others. But she has forsaken him_ and therefore it cannot be thought that she should be faithful to any one else; and whoever entertains her is partaker with her in her falsehood. Thirdly_ She is false to God himself: She forgets the covenant of her God_ the marriage-covenant (v. to which God is not only a witness_ but a party_ for_ he having instituted the ordinance_ both sides vow to him to be true to each other. It is not her husband only that she sins against_ but her God_ who will judge whoremongers and adulterers because they despise the oath and break the covenant_ Ezek. xvii. 18; Mal. ii,20250223
How far soever our desires wander_ and how closely soever our endeavours keep pace with them_ we cannot strive with the divine Providence_ but must submit to the disposals of it_ whether we will or no. If it is man_ he may not contend with him that is mightier than he. It is presumption to arraign God's proceedings_ and to charge him with folly or iniquity; nor is it to any purpose to complain of him_ for he is in one mind and who can turn him? Elihu pacifies Job with this incontest able principle_ That God is greater than man (Job xxxiii. 12) and therefore man may not contend with him_ nor resist his judgments_ when they come with commission. A man cannot with the greatest riches make his part good against the arrests of sickness or death_ but must yield to his fate.,20250223
How fatal it will prove to those that fall in league with her_ v. 18_ 19. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Take heed of the sin of whoredom; for_ First_ The ruin of those who are guilty of it is certain and unavoidable_ if they do not repent. It is a sin that has a direct tendency to the killing of the soul_ the extinguishing of all good affections and dispositions in it_ and the exposing of it to the wrath and curse of God and the sword of his justice. Those that live in forbidden pleasures are dead while they live. Let discretion preserve every man_ not only from the evil woman_ but from the evil house_ for the house inclines to death; it is in the road that leads directly to eternal death; and her paths unto Rephaim_ to the giants (so some read it)_ the sinners of the old world_ who_ living in luxury and excess of riot_ were cut down out of time_ and their foundation was overthrown with a flood. Our Lord Jesus deters us from sinful pleasures with the consideration of everlasting torments which follow them. Where the worm dies not_ nor is the fire quenched. See Matt. v. 28_ 29. Secondly_ Their repentance and recovery are extremely hazardous: None_ or next to none_ that go unto her_ return again. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil recover themselves_ so much is the heart hardened_ and the mind blinded_ by the deceitfulness of this sin. Having once lost their hold of the paths of life_ they know not how to take hold of them again_ but are perfectly besotted and bewitched with those base lusts. Many learned interpreters think that this caution against the strange woman_ besides the literal sense_ is to be understood figuratively_ as a caution,20250223
How fatal the consequences will be. What fruit will the sinner have of his honey and oil when the end will be_ ,20250223
How formidable kings are_ and what a terror they strike upon those they are angry with. Their fear_ with which (especially when they are absolute and their will is a law) they keep their subjects in awe_ is as the roaring of a lion_ which is very dreadful to the creatures he preys upon_ and makes them tremble so that they cannot escape from him. Those princes that rule by wisdom and love rule like God himself_ and bear his image; but those that rule merely by terror_ and with a high hand_ do but rule like a lion in the forest_ with a brutal power. Oderint_ dum metuant—Let them hate_ provided they fear,20250223
How formidable the wrath of a king is: It is as messengers of death; the wrath of Ahasuerus was so to Haman. An angry word from an incensed prince has been to many a messenger of death_ and has struck so great a terror upon some as if a sentence of death had been pronounced upon them. He must be a very wise man that knows how to pacify the wrath of a king with a word fitly spoken_ as Jonathan once pacified his father's rage against David_ 1 Sam. xix,20250223
How good people are encouraged in their goodness: Among the righteous there is favour; if they in any thing offend_ they presently repent and obtain the favour of God. They have a goodwill one to another; and among them_ in their societies_ there is mutual charity and compassion in cases of offences_ and no mocking.,20250223
How greedy he is of it (v. 15): He has swallowed down riches as eagerly as ever a hungry man swallowed down meat; and is still crying_ __Give_ give.__ It is that which he desired (v. 20); it was_ in his eye_ the best gift_ and that which he coveted earnestly. ,20250223
How hard-hearted poor people frequently are to one another_ not only not doing such good offices as they might do one to another_ but imposing upon and over-reaching one another. Those who know by experience the miseries of poverty should be compassionate to those who suffer the like_ but they are inexcusably barbarous if they be injurious to them,20250223
How hast thou_ with thy grave dictates_ counselled him that has no wisdom? v,20250223
How he aggravates their unkindness. 1. They had thus abused him often (v. 3): These ten times you have reproached me_ that is_ very often_ as Gen. xxxi. 7; Num. xiv,20250223
How he answers their harsh censures_ by showing them that what they condemned was capable of excuse_ which they ought to have considered. 1. The errors of his judgment were excusable,20250223
How he appeared for him. It is taken for granted that all his offences are forgiven; for if he be dignified_ as we find he is here_ no doubt he is justified. Job had sometimes intimated_ with great assurance_ that God would clear him at last_ and he was not made ashamed of the hope. ,20250223
How he calls to us_ and in what manner. 1. Very publicly_ that whosoever hath ears to hear may hear_ since all are welcome to take the benefit of what is said and all are concerned to heed it. The rules of wisdom are published without in the streets_ not in the schools only_ or in the palaces of princes_ but in the chief places of concourse_ among the common people that pass and repass in the opening of the gates and in the city. It is comfortable casting the net of the gospel where there is a multitude of fish_ in hopes that then some will be enclosed. This was fulfilled in our Lord Jesus_ who taught openly in the temple_ in crowds of people_ and in secret said nothing (John xviii. and charged his ministers to proclaim his gospel on the housetop_ Matt. x,20250223
How he came by these instructions; he had them from his parents_ and teaches his children the same that they taught him_ v. 3_ 4. Observe_ ,20250223
How he describes the sinners. They are robbers_ and such as provoke God_ the worst kind of sinners_ blasphemers and persecutors. Perhaps he refers to the Sabeans and Chaldeans_ who had robbed him_ and had always lived by spoil and rapine_ and yet they prospered; all the world saw they did_ and there is no disputing against sense; one observation built upon matter of fact is worth twenty notions framed by an hypothesis. Or more generally_ All proud oppressors are robbers and pirates. It is supposed that what is injurious to men is provoking to God_ the patron of right and the protector of mankind. It is not strange if those that violate the bonds of justice break through the obligations of all religion_ bid defiance even to God himself_ and make nothing of provoking him,20250223
How he describes their cruelty and oppression. The Hebrew tongue has five several names for lions_ and they are all here used to set forth the terrible tearing power_ fierceness_ and cruelty_ of proud oppressors. They roar_ and rend_ and prey upon all about them_ and bring up their young ones to do so too_ Ezek. xix,20250223
How he describes their destruction_ the destruction both of their power and of their persons. They shall be restrained from doing further hurt and reckoned with for the hurt they have done. An effectual course shall be taken_ ,20250223
How he describes their prosperity. It is very great; for_ ,20250223
How he describes them. ,20250223
How he dissuades the covetous man from cheating and deceiving himself by an inordinate love and pursuit of that which is vanity and vexation of spirit; for_,20250223
How he favours the cause of the poor and humble_ and espouses that. First_ He exalts the humble_ v,20250223
How he frustrates the counsels of the proud and politic_ v. 12-14. There is a supreme power that manages and overrules men who think themselves free and absolute_ and fulfils its own purposes in spite of their projects. Observe_ First_ The froward_ that walk contrary to God and the interests of his kingdom_ are often very crafty; for they are the seed of the old serpent that was noted for his subtlety. They think themselves wise_ but_ at the end_ will be fools. Secondly_ The Froward enemies of God's kingdom have their devices_ their enterprises_ and their counsels_ against it_ and against the loyal faithful subjects of it. They are restless and unwearied in their designs_ close in their consultations_ high in their hopes_ deep in their politics_ and fast-linked in their confederacies_ Ps.,20250223
How he is accepted: He shall lie all night between my breasts_ near my heart. Christ lays the beloved disciples in his bosom; why then should not they lay their beloved Saviour in their bosoms? Why should not they embrace him with both arms_ and hold him fast_ with a resolution never to let him go? Christ must dwell in the heart (Eph. iii. and_ in order to that_ the adulteries must be put from between the breasts (Hos. ii. no pretender must have his place in the soul. He shall be as a bundle of myrrh_ or perfume bag_ between my breasts_ always sweet to me; or his effigies in miniature_ his love-tokens_ shall be hung between my breasts_ according to the custom of those that are dear to each other. He shall not only be laid their for a while_ but shall lie there_ shall abide there.,20250223
How he is affected towards his spouse: Thou hast ravished my heart; the word is used only here. Thou hast hearted me_ or Thou has unhearted me. New words are coined to express the inexpressibleness of Christ's surprising love to his church; and the strength of that love is set forth by that which is a weakness in men_ the being so much in love with one object as to be heartless to every thing else. This may refer to that love which Christ had to the chosen remnant_ before the worlds were_ when his delights were with the sons of men (Prov. viii. that first love_ which brought him from heaven to earth_ to seek and save them at such vast expense_ yet including the complacency he takes in them when he has brought them to himself. Note_ Christ's heart is upon his church; so it has appeared all along. His treasure is in it; it is his peculiar treasure (Exod. xix. 5); and therefore there his heart is also. __Never was love like unto the love of Christ_ which made him even mindless of himself_ when he emptied himself of his glory_ and despised all shame and pain_ for our sakes. The wound of love towards us_ which he had from eternity in himself_ made him neglect all the wounds and reproaches of the cross;__ so Bishop Reynolds. Thus let us love him. ,20250223
How he is embarrassed: The steps of his strength_ his mighty designs and efforts_ shall be straitened_ so that he shall not compass what he intended; and the more he strives to extricate himself the more will he be entangled. Evil men wax worse and worse. ,20250223
How he is secured and kept from escaping the judgments of God that are in pursuit of him. The gin shall take him by the heel. He can no more escape the divine wrath that is in pursuit of him than a man_ so held_ can flee from the pursuer. God knows how to reserve the wicked for the day of judgment_ 2 Pet. ii. 9.,20250223
How he obviates the objections which might be made against this duty and the excuses of the uncharitable.,20250223
How he pleads this with God_ and what use he makes of it. He reminds God of it (v. 9): Remember_ I beseech thee_ that thou hast made me. What then? Why,20250223
How he spoke—Out of the whirlwind_ the rolling and involving cloud_ which Elihu took notice of_ ch. xxxvii. 1_ 2_ 9. A whirlwind prefaced Ezekiel's vision (Ezek. i. and Elijah's_ 1 Kings xix,20250223
How he supports himself. He makes his wealth his city_ where he dwells_ where he rules_ with a great deal of self-complacency_ as if he had a whole city under his command. It is his strong city_ in which he intrenches himself_ and then sets danger at defiance_ as if nothing could hurt him. His scales are his pride; his wealth is his wall in which he encloses himself_ and he thinks it a high wall_ which cannot be scaled or got over_ Job xxxi. 24; Rev. xviii. 7,20250223
How he that exalts himself is here abased_ and contempt put upon him. When pride comes then comes shame. Pride is a sin which men have reason to be themselves ashamed of; it is a shame to a man who springs out of the earth_ who lives upon alms_ depends upon God_ and has forfeited all he has_ to be proud. It is a sin which others cry out shame on and look upon with disdain; he that is haughty makes himself contemptible; it is a sin for which God often brings men down_ as he did Nebuchadnezzar and Herod_ whose ignominy immediately attended their vain-glory; for God resists the proud_ contradicts them_ and counterworks them_ in the thing they are proud of_ Isa. ii. 11_ &c,20250223
How he that humbles himself is here exalted_ and a high character is given him. As with the proud there is folly_ and will be shame_ so with the lowly there is wisdom_ and will be honour_ for a man's wisdom gains him respect and makes his face to shine before men; or_ if any be so base as to trample upon the humble_ God will give them grace which will be their glory. Considering how safe_ and quiet_ and easy_ those are that are of a humble spirit_ what communion they have with God and comfort in themselves_ we will say_ With the lowly is wisdom.,20250223
How he would teach them: By the hand of God_ that is_ by his strength and assistance. Those who undertake to teach others must look to the hand of God to direct them_ to open their ear (Isa. l. and to open their lips. Those whom God teaches with a strong hand are best able to teach others_ Isa. viii. 11.,20250223
How herein he cheats himself. It is a strong city_ and a high wall_ but it is so only in his own conceit; it will not prove to be really so_ but like the house built on the sand_ which will fail the builder when he most needs it.,20250223
How his looks are altered: Thou changest his countenance_ and this in two ways:—First_ By the disease of his body. When a man has been a few days sick what a change is there in his countenance! How much more when he has been a few minutes dead! The countenance which was majestic and awful becomes mean and despicable—that was lovely and amiable becomes ghastly and frightful. Bury my dead out of my sight. Where then is the admired beauty? Death changes the countenance_ and then sends us away out of this world_ gives us one dismission hence_ never to return. Secondly_ By the discomposure of his mind. Note_ The approach of death will make the strongest and stoutest to change countenance; it will make the most merry smiling countenance to look grave and serious_ and the most bold daring countenance to look pale and timorous. ,20250223
How impatient the devil was of hearing Job praised_ though it was God himself that praised him. Those are like the devil who cannot endure that any body should be praised but themselves_ but grudge the just share of reputation others have_ as Saul (1 Sam. xviii. 5_ &c.) and the Pharisees_ Matt. xxi. 15,20250223
How imperious and griping those commonly are who_ being indigent and necessitous_ get into power. If a prince prefer a poor man_ he forgets that ever he was poor_ and none shall be so oppressive to the poor as he_ nor squeeze them so cruelly. The hungry leech and the dry sponge suck most. Set a beggar on horseback_ and he will ride without mercy. He is like a sweeping rain_ which washes away the corn in the ground_ and lays and beats out that which has grown_ so that it leaves no food. Princes therefore ought not to put those into places of trust who are poor_ and in debt_ and behind-hand in the world_ nor any who make it their main business to enrich themselves.,20250223
How indefeasible the happiness of the saints is; the God that cannot lie has engaged that to the righteous good shall be repaid. They shall be abundantly recompensed for all the good they have done_ and all the ill they have suffered_ in this world; so that_ though many have been losers for their righteousness_ they shall not be losers by it. Though the recompence do not come quickly_ it will come in the day of payment_ in the world of retribution; and it will be an abundant recompence.,20250223
How industrious a good man is_ by communicating his goodness_ to do good with it: His mouth_ the outlet of his mind_ is a well of life; it is a constant spring_ whence issues good discourse for the edification of others_ like streams that water the ground and make it fruitful_ and for their consolation_ like streams that quench the thirst of the weary traveller. It is like a well of life_ that is pure and clean_ not only not poisoned_ but not muddled_ with any corrupt communication.,20250223
How industrious generally all are_ both princes and people_ to get money_ because that serves for all purposes_ v,20250223
How industrious wicked people are to seduce others into the paths of the destroyer: they will entice. Sinners love company in sin; the angels that fell were tempters almost as soon as they were sinners. They do not threaten or argue_ but entice with flattery and fair speech; with a bait they draw the unwary young man to the hook. But they mistake if they think that by bringing others to partake with them in their guilt_ and to be bound_ as it were_ in the bond with them_ they shall have the less to pay themselves; for they will have so much the more to answer for,20250223
How it becomes calm after it has been stormy: He quiets the earth by the south wind_ when the spring comes. As he has a blustering freezing north wind_ so he has a thawing_ composing_ south wind; the Spirit is compared to both_ because he both convinces and comforts_ Cant. iv. 16.,20250223
How it came to be so firmly fixed. Though it is hung upon nothing_ yet it is established_ that it cannot be moved; but who can tell upon what the foundations of it are fastened_ that it may not sink with its own weight_ or who laid the corner-stone thereof_ that the parts of it may not fall asunder? v,20250223
How it increases by the accession of the wealth of the sinner to it_ for that is laid up for the just. If it be asked_ How should good men grow so rich_ who are not so eager upon the world as others are and who commonly suffer for their well-doing? It is here answered_ God_ in his providence_ often brings into their hands that which wicked people had laid up for themselves. The innocent shall divide the silver_ Job xxvii. 16_ 17. The Israelites shall spoil the Egyptians (Exod.,20250223
How it stood between him and God. He doubted not but that_ ,20250223
How little he is concerned in the affairs of his family_ which once lay so near his heart. When he is in the hands of the harbingers of death_ suppose struck with a palsy or apoplexy_ or delirious in a fever_ or in conflict with death_ tell him then the most agreeable news_ or the most painful_ concerning his children_ it is all alike_ he knows it not_ he perceives it not_ v,20250223
How little regard is to be had to a false witness. He forges lies_ and yet pours them out with the greatest assurance imaginable for the destruction of the innocent. It is therefore the interest of a nation by all means possible to detect and punish false-witness-bearing_ yea_ and lying in common conversation; for truth is the cement of society.,20250223
How many are the afflictions of the afflicted in this world! Such are not to be censured or despised_ but pitied and prayed for_ succoured and comforted. It might have been our own lot_ or may be yet_ merry as we are at present.,20250223
How many are the calamities of old age_ and that if we should live to be old_ our days will be such as we shall have no pleasure in_ which is a good reason why we should return to God_ and make our peace with him_ in the days of our youth_ and not put it off till we come to be old; for it will be no thanks to us to leave the pleasures of sin when they have left us_ nor to return to God when need forces us. It is the greatest absurdity and ingratitude imaginable to give the cream and flower of our days to the devil_ and reserve the bran_ and refuse_ and dregs of them for God; this is offering the torn_ and the lame_ and the sick for sacrifice; and_ besides_ old age being thus clogged with infirmities_ it is the greatest folly imaginable to put off that needful work till then_ which requires the best of our strength_ when our faculties are in their prime_ and especially to make the work more difficult by a longer continuance in sin_ and_ laying up treasures of guilt in the conscience_ to add to the burdens of age and make them much heavier. If the calamities of age will be such as are here represented_ we shall have need of something to support and comfort us then_ and nothing will be more effectual to do that than the testimony of our consciences for us that we begin betimes to remember our Creator and have not since laid aside the remembrance of him. How can we expect God should help us when we are old_ if we will not serve him when we are young? See Ps. lxxi. 17_ 18.,20250223
How mildly he checks her for her ignorance_ in these words_ If thou know not_ intimating that she might have known it if it had not been her own fault. What! dost thou not know where to find me and my flock? Compare Christ's answer to a like address of Philip's (John xiv.,20250223
How mischievous those are that make no scruple of deceiving their neighbours; they are as madmen that cast firebrands_ arrows_ and death_ so much hurt may they do by their deceits. They value themselves upon it as polite cunning men_ but really they are as madmen. There is not a greater madness in the world than a wilful sin. It is not only the passionate furious man_ but the malicious deceitful man_ that is a madman; he does in effect cast fire-brands_ arrows_ and death; he does more mischief than he can imagine. Fraud and falsehood burn like fire-brands_ kill_ even at a distance_ like arrows,20250223
How miserably mistaken those are that not only do evil_ but devise it: Do they not err? Yes_ certainly they do; every one knows it. They think that by sinning with craft and contrivance_ and carrying on their intrigues with more plot and artifice than others_ they shall make a better hand of their sins than others do_ and come off better. But they are mistaken. God's justice cannot be out-witted. Those that devise evil against their neighbours greatly err_ for it will certainly turn upon themselves and end in their own ruin_ a fatal error! 2. How wisely those consult their own interest that not only do good but devise it: Mercy and truth shall be to them_ not a reward of debt (they will own that they merit nothing)_ but a reward of mercy_ mere mercy_ mercy according to the promise_ mercy and truth_ to which God is pleased to make himself a debtor. Those that are so liberal as to devise liberal things_ that seek opportunities of doing good_ and contrive how to make their charity most extensive and most acceptable to those that need it_ by liberal things they shall stand_ Isa. xxxii. 8.,20250223
How much at a loss he was for something to object against him; he could not accuse him of any thing that was bad_ and therefore charged him with by-ends in doing good. Had the one half of that been true which his angry friends_ in the heat of dispute_ charged him with (ch. xv. 4_ xxii.,20250223
How much praise is due to a faithful witness: He delivers the souls of the innocent_ who are falsely accused_ and their good names_ which are as dear to them as their lives. A man of integrity will venture the displeasure of the greatest_ to bring truth to light and rescue those who are injured by falsehood. A faithful minister_ who truly witnesses for God against sin_ is thereby instrumental to deliver souls from eternal death,20250223
How much this will be the satisfaction of the master; it will refresh his soul as much as ever the cold of snow (which is hot countries they preserve by art all the year round) refreshed the labourers in the harvest_ that bore the burden and heat of the day. The more important the affair was_ and the more fear of its miscarrying_ the more acceptable is the messenger_ if he have managed it successfully and well. A faithful minister_ Christ's messenger_ should be thus acceptable to us (Job xxxiii. 23); however_ he will be a sweet savour to God_ 2 Cor. ii. 15.,20250223
How natural it is to us to desire to hear good news from our friends_ and concerning our affairs at a distance. It is sometimes with impatience that we expect to hear from abroad; our souls thirst after it. But we should check the inordinateness of that desire; if it be bad news_ it will come too soon_ if good_ it will be welcome at any time,20250223
How often do you see their destruction come upon them_ or God distributing sorrows in his anger among them? Do you not as often see their mirth and prosperity continuing to the last?__ Perhaps there are as many instances of notorious sinners ending their days in pomp as ending them in misery_ which observation is sufficient to invalidate their arguments against Job and to show that no certain judgment can be made of men's character by their outward condition.,20250223
How pernicious the consequences of it will be. They are plainly told that this wicked way will certainly end in their own destruction_ and yet they persist in it. Herein_ ,20250223
How pernicious their way is in its own nature (v. 16): Their feet run to evil_ to that which is displeasing to God and hurtful to mankind_ for they make haste to shed blood. Note_ The way of sin is down-hill; men not only cannot stop themselves_ but_ the longer they continue in it_ the faster they run_ and make haste in it_ as if they were afraid they should not do mischief enough and were resolved to lose no time. They said they would proceed leisurely (Let us lay wait for blood_ v.but thou wilt find they are all in haste_ so much has Satan filled their hearts,20250223
How shall God either rule or judge the world if there be_ or could be_ any unrighteousness with him? Rom. iii. 5_ 6. He that is entitled to such unlimited power most certainly have in himself unspotted purity. This is also a good reason why we should acquiesce in all God's dealings with us. Shall not he that disposes of the whole world dispose of us and our concerns? ,20250223
How she ascribes the good work of God in her to the good-will of God towards her: __He has made me a wall and my breasts as towers_ and then_ in that instance more than in any thing_ I experienced his love to me.__ Hail_ thou that art highly favoured_ for in thee Christ is formed. ,20250223
How she enquired of the watchmen concerning him_ v,20250223
How she exposes her eggs; she does not retire to some private place_ and make a nest there_ as the sparrows and swallows do (Ps. lxxxiv. and there lay eggs and hatch her young. Most birds_ as well as other animals_ are strangely guided by natural instinct in providing for the preservation of their young. But the ostrich is a monster in nature_ for she drops her eggs any where upon the ground and takes no care to hatch them. If the sand and the sun will hatch them_ well and good; they may for her_ for she will not warm them_ v,20250223
How she had sought him in vain abroad_ v,20250223
How she represents them. She calls them simple and wanting understanding_ and therefore courts them to her school_ that they may be cured of the restraints and formalities of their religion. This is the method of the stage (which is too close an exposition of this paragraph)_ where the sober young man_ that has been virtuously educated_ is the fool in the play_ and the plot is to make him seven times more a child of hell than his profane companions_ under colour of polishing and refining him_ and setting him up for a wit and a beau. What is justly charged upon sin and impiety (v. that it is folly_ is here very unjustly retorted upon the ways of virtue; but the day will declare who are the fools.,20250223
How she was entertained: His banner over me was love; he brought me in with a banner displayed over my head_ not as one he triumphed over_ but as one he triumphed in_ and whom he always caused to triumph with him and in him_ 2 Cor. ii,20250223
How she was introduced: __He brought me_ wrought in me an inclination to draw nigh to God_ helped me over my discouragements_ took me by the hand_ guided and led me_ and gave me an access with boldness to God as a Father___ Eph. ii,20250223
How should man be just with God? Some understand this as a passionate complaint of God's strictness and severity_ that he is a God whom there is no dealing with; and it cannot be denied that there are_ in this chapter_ some peevish expressions_ which seem to speak such language as this. But I take this rather as a pious confession of man's sinfulness_ and his own in particular_ that_ if God should deal with any of us according to the desert of our iniquities_ we should certainly be undone.,20250223
How slightly he speaks of the affliction he desired that Job might be tried with: __Do but touch all that he has_ do but begin with him_ do but threaten to make him poor; a little cross will change his tone.__ 2. How spitefully he speaks of the impression it would make upon Job: __He will not only let fall his devotion_ but turn it into an open defiance—not only think hardly of thee_ but even curse thee to thy face.__ The word translated curse is barac_ the same that ordinarily_ and originally_ signifies to bless; but cursing God is so impious a thing that the holy language would not admit the name: but that where the sense requires it it must be so understood is plain form 1 Kings xxi. 10-13_ where the word is used concerning the crime charged on Naboth_ that he did blaspheme God and the king. Now_ ,20250223
How swift the motion of time is. It is always upon the wing_ hastening to its period; it stays for no man. What little need have we of pastimes_ and what great need to redeem time_ when time runs out_ runs on so fast towards eternity_ which comes as time goes! 2. How vain the enjoyments of time are_ which we may be quite deprived of while yet time continues. Our day may be longer than the sun-shine of our prosperity; and_ when that is gone_ it is as if it had not been. The remembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; so will not the remembrance of our having got a great deal of worldly wealth when it is all lost and gone. __They flee away_ past recall; they see no good_ and leave none behind them.__,20250223
How the appointments and events of Providence are counterchanged. In this world_ at the same time_ some are in prosperity_ others are in adversity; the same persons at one time are in great prosperity_ at another time in great adversity; nay_ one event prosperous_ and another grievous_ may occur to the same person at the same time. Both come from the hand of God; out of his mouth both evil and good proceed (Isa. and he has set the one over against the other_ so that there is a very short and easy passage between them_ and they are a foil to each other. Day and night_ summer and winter_ are set the one over against the other_ that in prosperity we may rejoice as though we rejoiced not_ and in adversity may weep as though we wept not_ for we may plainly see the one from the other and quickly exchange the one for the other; and it is to the end that man may find nothing after him_ that he may not be at any certainty concerning future events or the continuance of the present scene_ but may live in a dependence upon Providence and be ready for whatever happens. Or that man may find nothing in the work of God which he can pretend to amend. ,20250223
How the case stood between him and his friends. He knew not how to be free with them_ nor could he expect either a fair hearing with them or fair dealing from them. __My friends (so they call themselves) scorn me; they set themselves not only to resist me_ but to expose me; they are of counsel against me_ and use all their art and eloquence__ (so the word signifies) __to run me down.__ The scorns of friends are more cutting than those of enemies; but we must expect them_ and provide accordingly,20250223
How the guilt of sin is taken away from us—by the mercy and truth of God_ mercy in promising_ truth in performing_ the mercy and truth which kiss each other in Jesus Christ the Mediator—by the covenant of grace_ in which mercy and truth shine so brightly—by our mercy and truth_ as the condition of the pardon and a necessary qualification for it—by these_ and not by the legal sacrifices_ Mic. vi. 7_ 8,20250223
How the light and darkness were at first made. When God_ in the beginning_ first spread darkness upon the face of the deep_ and afterwards commanded the light to shine out of darkness_ by that mighty word_ Let there be light_ was Job a witness to the order_ to the operation? can he tell where the fountains of light and darkness are_ and where those mighty princes keep their courts distance_ while in one world they rule alternately? Though we long ever so much either for the shining forth of the morning or the shadows of the evening_ we know not whither to send_ or go_ to fetch them_ nor can tell the paths to the house thereof_ v,20250223
How the peace may be kept_ that we may know how in our places to keep it; it is by soft words. If wrath be risen like a threatening cloud_ pregnant with storms and thunder_ a soft answer will disperse it and turn it away. When men are provoked_ speak gently to them_ and give them good words_ and they will be pacified_ as the Ephraimites were by Gideon's mildness (Judg. viii. 1-3); whereas_ upon a like occasion_ by Jephthah's roughness_ they were exasperated_ and the consequences were bad_ Judg. xii. 1-3. Reason will be better spoken_ and a righteous cause better pleaded_ with meekness then with passion; hard arguments do best with soft words,20250223
How the peace will be broken_ that we_ for our parts_ may do nothing towards the breaking of it. Nothing stirs up anger_ and sows discord_ like grievous words_ calling foul names_ as Raca_ and Thou fool_ upbraiding men with their infirmities and infelicities_ their extraction or education_ or any thing that lessens them and makes them mean; scornful spiteful reflections_ by which men affect to show their wit and malice_ stir up the anger of others_ which does but increase and inflame their own anger. Rather than lose a jest some will lose a friend and make an enemy.,20250223
How the power of sin is broken in us. By the principles of mercy and truth commanding in us the corrupt inclinations are purged out (so we may take the former part); however_ by the fear of the Lord_ and the influence of that fear_ men depart from evil; those will not dare to sin against God who keep up in their minds a holy dread and reverence of him.,20250223
How the reproof is expressed: __How long will you do so?__ This implies that the God of heaven desires the conversion and reformation of sinners and not their ruin_ that he is much displeased with their obstinacy and dilatoriness_ that he waits to be gracious_ and is willing to reason the case with them.,20250223
How the sinner is infatuated_ to run himself into the snare; and whom God will destroy he infatuates. ,20250223
How the weather becomes warm after it has been cold. We know how our garment came to be warm upon us_ that is_ how we come to be warm in our clothes_ by reason of the warmth of the air we breathe in. Without God's blessing we should clothe ourselves_ yet not be warm_ Hag. i,20250223
How the world came to be so finely framed_ with so much exactness_ and such an admirable symmetry and proportion of all the parts of it (v. 5): __Stand forth_ and tell who laid the measures thereof and stretched out the line upon it.__ Wast thou the architect that formed the model and then drew the dimensions by rule according to it? The vast bulk of the earth is moulded as regularly as if it had been done by line and measure; but who can describe how it was cast into this figure? Who can determine its circumference and diameter_ and all the lines that are drawn on the terrestrial globe? It is to this day a dispute whether the earth stands still or turns round; how then can we determine by what measures it was first formed? ,20250223
How these imaginary difficulties may be conquered. An honest desire and endeavour to do our duty will_ by the grace of God_ make it easy_ and we shall find it strewed with roses: The way of the righteous is made plain; it is easy to be trodden and not rough_ easy to be found_ and not intricate.,20250223
How they still keep their turns interchangeably. It is God that makes the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to rejoice (Ps. lxv. 8); for it is his order_ and no order of ours_ that is executed by the outgoings of the morning light and the darkness of the night. We cannot so much as tell whence they come nor whither they go (v. 24): By what way is the light parted in the morning_ when_ in an instant_ it shoots itself into all the parts of the air above the horizon_ as if the morning light flew upon the wings of an east wind_ so swiftly_ so strongly_ is it carried_ scattering the darkness of the night_ as the east wind does the clouds? Hence we read of the wings of the morning (Ps. cxxxix. on which the light is conveyed to the uttermost parts of the sea_ and scattered like an east wind upon the earth. It is a marvellous change that passes over us every morning by the return of the light and every evening by the return of the darkness; but we expect them_ and so they are no surprise nor uneasiness to us. If we would_ in like manner_ reckon upon changes in our outward condition_ we should neither in the brightest noon expect perpetual day nor in the darkest midnight despair of the return of the morning. God has set the one over against the other_ like the day and night; and so must we_ Eccl. vii. 14.,20250223
How those are to be pitied that are unequally yoked_ especially with such as are brawling and contentious_ whether husband or wife; for it is equally true of both. It is better to be alone than to be joined to one who_ instead of being a meet-help_ is a great hindrance to the comfort of life,20250223
How those may sometimes be envied that live in solitude; as they want the comfort of society_ so they are free from the vexation of it. And as there are cases which give occasion to say_ __Blessed is the womb that has not borne___ so there are which give occasion to say_ __Blessed is the man who was never married_ but who lies like a servant in a corner of the house-top.__,20250223
How those that are poor and low are slighted and despised. Men may_ if they please_ court the prince_ and the princely_ but they may not trample upon the poor and look at them with disdain. Yet so it often is: All the brethren of the poor do hate him; even his own relations are shy of him_ because he is needy and craving_ and expects something from them_ and because they look upon him as a blemish to their family; and then no marvel if others of his friends_ that were nothing akin to him_ go far from him_ to get out of his way. He pursues them with words_ hoping to prevail with them by his importunity to be kind to him_ but all in vain; they have nothing for him. They pursue him with words (so some understand it)_ to excuse themselves from giving him any thing; they tell him that he is idle and impertinent_ that he has brought himself into poverty_ and therefore ought not to be relieved; as Nabal said to David's messengers: __There are many servants now a days that run away from their masters; and how do I know but that David may be one of them?__ Let poor people therefore make God their friend_ pursue him with their prayers_ and he will not be wanting to them.,20250223
How those that are rich and great are courted and caressed_ and have suitors and servants in abundance. The prince that has power in his hand_ and preferments at his disposal_ has his gate and his ante-chamber thronged with petitioners_ that are ready to adore him for what they can get. Many will entreat his favour_ and think themselves happy in it. Even great men are humble suppliants to the prince. How earnest then should we be for the favour of God_ which is far beyond that of any earthly prince. But_ it should seem_ liberality will go further than majesty itself to gain respect_ for there are many that court the prince_ but every man is a friend to him that gives gifts; not only those that have received_ or do expect_ gifts from him_ will_ as friends_ be ready to serve him_ but others also will_ as friends_ give him their good word. Prodigals_ who are foolishly free of what they have_ will have many hangers-on who will cry them up as long as it lasts_ but will leave them when it is done. Those that are prudently generous make an interest by it which may stand them in good stead; those that are accounted benefactors exercise an authority which may give them an opportunity of doing good_ Luke xxii. 25,20250223
How unavoidable the destruction of sinners is; the wrath of God pursues them_ and all the terrors of that wrath: Evil pursues them closely wherever they go_ as the avenger of blood pursued the manslayer_ and they have no city of refuge to flee to; they attempt an escape_ but in vain. Whom God pursues he is sure to overtake. They may prosper for a while and grow very secure_ but their damnation slumbers not_ though they do,20250223
How uncertain all our creature-comforts are_ so that we are often not only disappointed in them_ but that proves the greatest cross in which we promised ourselves most satisfaction. There was joy when a man-child was born into the world_ and yet_ if he prove vicious_ his own father will wish he had never been born. The name of Absalom signifies his father's peace_ but he was his greatest trouble. It should moderate the desire of having children_ and the delights of their parents in them_ that they may prove a grief to them; yet it should silence the murmurings of the afflicted father in that case that if his son be a fool he is a fool of his own begetting_ and therefore he must make the best of him_ and take it up as his cross_ the rather because Adam begets a son in his own likeness,20250223
How unjustly he accused him as mercenary_ to prove him a hypocrite. It was a great truth that Job did not fear God for nought; he got much by it_ for godliness is great gain: but it was a falsehood that he would not have feared God if he had not got this by it_ as the event proved. Job's friends charged him with hypocrisy because he was greatly afflicted_ Satan because he greatly prospered. It is no hard matter for those to calumniate that seek an occasion. It is not mercenary to look at the eternal recompence in our obedience; but to aim at temporal advantages in our religion_ and to make it subservient to them_ is spiritual idolatry_ worshipping the creature more than the Creator_ and is likely to end in a fatal apostasy. Men cannot long serve God and mammon.,20250223
How unwise therefore those are that quarrel with them_ that are angry at them_ and so provoke them to anger. They sin against their own lives. Much more do those do so that provoke the King of kings to anger. Nemo me impune lacesset—No one shall provoke me with impunity.,20250223
How unwise we are in suffering one affliction (and that of an untoward child as likely as any other) to drown the sense of a thousand mercies: The father of a fool lays that so much to heart that he has no joy of any thing else. For this he may thank himself; there are joys sufficient to counterbalance even that sorrow.,20250223
How vain it is to expect much from the enjoyments of life: __Thou destroyest the hope of man___ that is_ __puttest an end to all the projects he had framed and all the prospects of satisfaction he had flattered himself with.__ Death will be the destruction of all those hopes which are built upon worldly confidences and confined to worldly comforts. Hope in Christ_ and hope in heaven_ death will consummate and not destroy. ,20250223
How vain it is to struggle against the assaults of death (v. 20): Thou prevailest for ever against him. Note_ Man is an unequal match for God. Whom God contends with he will certainly prevail against_ prevail for ever against so that they shall never be able to make head again. Note further_ The stroke of death is irresistible; it is to no purpose to dispute its summons. God prevails against man and he passes away_ and lo he is not. Look upon a dying man_ and see_ ,20250223
How valuable and desirable the king's favour is to those that have incurred his displeasure; it is life from the dead if the king be reconciled to them. To others it is as a cloud of the latter rain_ very refreshing to the ground. Solomon put his subjects in mind of this_ that they might not do any thing to incur his wrath_ but be careful to recommend themselves to his favour. We ought by it to be put in mind how much we are concerned to escape the wrath and obtain the favour of the King of kings. His frowns are worse than death_ and his favour is better than life; and therefore those are fools who to escape the wrath_ and obtain the favour_ of an earthly prince_ will throw themselves out of God's favour_ and make themselves obnoxious to his wrath.,20250223
How warmly it is asserted,20250223
How we may discern a fool and discover him_ a wicked man_ for he is a foolish man. If we perceive not in him the lips of knowledge_ if we find there is no relish or savour of piety in his discourse_ that his communication is all corrupt and corrupting_ and nothing in it good and to the use of edifying_ we may conclude the treasure is bad,20250223
How we must comply with the will of God in events of both kinds. Our religion_ in general_ must be the same in all conditions_ but the particular instances and exercises of it must vary_ as our outward condition does_ that we may walk after the Lord. ,20250223
How we must decline such a one and depart from him: Go from his presence_ for thou perceivest there is no good to be gotten by his company_ but danger of getting hurt by it. Sometimes the only way we have of reproving wicked discourse and witnessing against it is by leaving the company and going out of the hearing of it.,20250223
How we must discourage sin and witness against it_ and particularly the sin of slandering and backbiting; we must frown upon it_ and_ by giving it an angry countenance_ endeavour to put it out of countenance. Slanders would not be so readily spoken as they are if they were not readily heard; but good manners would silence the slanderer if he saw that his tales displeased the company. We should show ourselves uneasy if we heard a dear friend_ whom we value_ evil-spoken of; the same dislike we should show of evil-speaking in general. If we cannot otherwise reprove_ we may do it by our looks,20250223
How we must express our love to our enemies by the real offices of kindness_ even those that are expensive to ourselves and most acceptable to them: __If they be hungry and thirsty_ instead of pleasing thyself with their distress and contriving how to cut off supplies from them_ relieve them_ as Elisha did the Syrians that came to apprehend him___ 2 King vi. 22,20250223
How well is it for us that neither men nor devils are to be our judges_ for perhaps they would destroy us_ right or wrong; but our judgment proceeds from the Lord_ whose judgment never errs nor is biassed,20250223
How wicked people are hardened in their wickedness: they make a mock at sin. They make a laughing matter of the sins of others_ making themselves and their companions merry with that for which they should mourn_ and they make a light matter of their own sins_ both when they are tempted to sin and when they have committed it; they call evil good and good evil (Isa. v.,20250223
How wonderfully are the brute-creatures fitted for and inclined to the services for which they were designed. ,20250223
However_ be the trouble what it will_ sleep gives some intermission to the cares_ and pains_ and griefs_ that afflict us; it is the parenthesis of our sorrows. But poor Job could not gain this relief. ,20250223
However_ if Job should retain his religion_ Satan would have the satisfaction to see him sorely afflicted. He hates good men_ and delights in their griefs_ as God has pleasure in their prosperity.,20250223
However_ we shall be no losers by our self-denial: __Whether he relent towards thee or no_ the Lord shall reward thee; he shall forgive thee who thus showest thyself to be of a forgiving spirit. He shall provide for thee when thou art in distress (though thou hast been evil and ungrateful)_ as thou dost for thy enemy; at least it shall be recompensed in the resurrection of the just_ when kindnesses done to our enemies shall be remembered as well as those shown to God's friends.__,20250223
Humility is the presage of honour and prepares men for it_ and honour shall at length be the reward of humility_ as he had said before_ ch. xv,20250223
Hurtful melancholy is what we are cautioned against_ as a great enemy to us_ both in our devotion and in our conversation: By sorrow of the heart_ when it has got dominion and plays the tyrant_ as it will be apt to do it if be indulged awhile_ the spirit is broken and sunk_ and becomes unfit for the service of God. The sorrow of the world works death. Let us therefore weep as though we wept not_ in justice to ourselves_ as well as in conformity to God and his providence.,20250223
Hypocrisy designing ill. It is not only the murderer with his sword_ but the hypocrite with his mouth_ that destroys his neighbour_ decoying him into sin_ or into mischief_ by the specious pretences of kindness and good-will. Death and life are in the power of the tongue_ but no tongue more fatal than the flattering tongue,20250223
Hypocrisy in concealing his own sins and cowardice in conniving at the sins of others_ ver. 33_ 34,20250223
I,20250223
I also as well as thou.__ Job had urged this with God as a reason why he should not bear hard upon him (ch. x.,20250223
I am black by reason of my sufferings: The sun has looked upon me. She was fair and comely; whiteness was her proper colour; but she got this blackness by the burden and heat of the day_ which she was forced to bear. She was sun-burnt_ scorched with tribulation and persecution (Matt. xiii. 6_ 21); and the greatest beauties_ if exposed to the weather_ are soonest tanned. Observe how she mitigates her troubles; she does not say_ as Jacob (Gen. xxxi.,20250223
I am black_ but comely_ O ye daughters of Jerusalem_ as the tents of Kedar_ as the curtains of Solomon. 6 Look not upon me_ because I am black_ because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.,20250223
I and all that I have any interest in or influence upon_ I and my house (Josh. xxiv.,20250223
I charge you_ O ye daughters of Jerusalem_ by the roes_ and by the hinds of the field_ that ye stir not up_ nor awake my love_ till he please.,20250223
I have compared thee to my company of horses which triumphed over Pharaoh's chariots_ the holy angels_ horses of fire.__ Hab. iii. 15_ Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses; and see Isa. lxiii,20250223
I have done: I will not answer; I will not stand to what I have said_ nor say it again; I will proceed no further.__ Observe here what true repentance is. ,20250223
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. 6 Wherefore I abhor myself_ and repent in dust and ashes.,20250223
I have nothing here to boast of—nothing at all_ but a great deal to be humbled for_ that I have not come up to what I have aimed at in respect of fulness and exactness. In the review of the work_ I find many defects_ and those who are critical_ perhaps_ will meet with some mistakes in it; but I have done it with what care I could_ and desire to be thankful to God who by his grace has carried me on in his work thus far: let that grace have all the glory (Phil. ii. which works in us both to will and to do whatever we will or do that is good or serves any good purpose. What is from God will_ I trust_ be to him_ will be graciously accepted by him_ according to what a man has_ and not according to what he had not_ and will be of some use to his church; and what is from myself (that is_ all the defects and errors) will_ I trust_ be favourably passed by and pardoned. That prayer of St.,20250223
I have peace-offerings with me_ Prov. vii. 14,20250223
I know not but we may look upon Job as a type and figure of Christ in his power and prosperity. Our Lord Jesus is such a King as Job was_ the poor man's King_ who loves righteousness and hates iniquity_ and upon whom the blessing of a world ready to perish comes; see Ps. lxxii. 2_ &c. To him therefore let us give ear_ and let him sit chief in our hearts.,20250223
I know thy parentage is base and low;,20250223
I never covered my transgression as Adam_ never palliated a sin with frivolous excuses_ nor made fig-leaves the shelter of my shame_ nor ever hid my iniquity in my bosom_ as a fondling_ a darling_ that I could by no means part with_ or as stolen goods which I dreaded the discovery of.__ It is natural to us to cover our sins; we have it from our first parents. We are loth to confess our faults_ willing to extenuate them and make the best of ourselves_ to devolve the blame upon others_ as Adam on his wife_ not without a tacit reflection upon God himself. But he that thus covers his sins shall not prosper_ Prov.,20250223
I rather understand it of a recompence of reward to the righteous and punishment to sinners. Let us behold providential retributions. There are some recompences in the earth_ in this world_ and in the things of this world_ which prove that verily there is a God that judges in the earth (Ps. lviii. 11); but they are not universal; many sins go unpunished in the earth_ and services unrewarded_ which indicates that there is a judgment to come_ and that there will be more exact and full retributions in the future state. Many times the righteous are recompensed for their righteousness here in the earth_ though that is not the principal_ much less the only reward either intended for them or intended by them; but whatever the word of God has promised them_ or the wisdom of God sees good for them_ they shall have in the earth. The wicked also_ and the sinner_ are sometimes remarkably punished in this life_ nations_ families_ particular persons. And if the righteous_ who do not deserve the least reward_ yet have part of their recompence here on earth_ much more shall the wicked_ who deserve the greatest punishment_ have part of their punishment on earth_ as an earnest of worse to come. Therefore stand in awe and sin not. If those have two heavens that merit none_ much more shall those have two hells that merit both.,20250223
I remembered God and was troubled_ Ps. lxxvii. 2_ 3. And yet she is not driven off by the disappointment from the use of further means; she resolves_ __I will rise now; I will not lie here if I cannot find my beloved here_ nor be content if he be withdrawn. I will rise now without delay_ and seek him immediately_ lest he withdraw further from me.__ Those that would seek Christ so as to find him must lose no time. __I will rise out of a warm bed_ and go out in a cold dark night_ in quest of my beloved.__ Those that see Christ must not startle at difficulties. __I will rise_ and go about the city_ the holy city_ in the streets_ and the broad-ways;__ for she knew he was not to be found in any blind by-ways. We must seek in the city_ in Jerusalem_ which was a type of the gospel-church. The likeliest place to find Christ is in the temple (Luke ii. in the streets of the gospel-church_ in holy ordinances_ where the children of Zion pass and repass at all hours. She had a good purpose when she said_ I will arise now_ but the good performance was all in all. She arose_ and sought him (those that are in pursuit of Christ_ the knowledge of him and communion with him_ must turn every stone_ seek every where)_ and yet she found him not; she was still unsatisfied_ uneasy_ as Job_ when he looked on all sides_ but could not perceive any tokens of the divine favour (Job xxiii. 8_ and the Psalmist often_ when he complained that God hid his face from him_ Ps. lxxxviii,20250223
I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh_ and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh_ upon the handles of the lock. 6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself_ and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him_ but I could not find him; I called him_ but he gave me no answer. 7 The watchmen that went about the city found me_ they smote me_ they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. 8 I charge you_ O daughters of Jerusalem_ if ye find my beloved_ that ye tell him_ that I am sick of love.,20250223
I said of laughter_ It is mad_ or_ Thou art mad_ and therefore I will have nothing to do with thee; and of mirth (of all sports and recreations_ and whatever pretends to be diverting)_ What doeth it? or_ What doest thou? Innocent mirth_ soberly_ seasonable_ and moderately used_ is a good thing_ fits for business_ and helps to soften the toils and chagrins of human life; but_ when it is excessive and immoderate_ it is foolish and fruitless. ,20250223
I saw the wicked buried_ who had come and gone from the place of the holy_ and they were forgotten.,20250223
I shall not see the Lord. As_ when we are in prosperity_ we are ready to think our mountain will never be brought low_ so when we are in adversity we are ready to think our valley will never be filled_ but_ in both_ to conclude that to morrow must be as this day_ which is as absurd as to think_ when the weather is either fair or foul_ that is will be always so_ that the flowing tide will always flow_ or the ebbing tide will always ebb.,20250223
I sink_ I die_ as if with lightning struck.,20250223
I thought to draw my flesh with wine (so the margin reads it) or to wine. Those that have addicted themselves to drinking did at first put a force upon themselves; they drew their flesh to it_ and with it; but they should remember to what miseries they hereby draw themselves,20250223
I will give you rest_ Matt. xi,20250223
I would know the words which he would answer me_ and understand what he would say unto me. 6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. 7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.,20250223
I. A copious description of the beauty of the spouse_ which_ some think_ is given by the virgins her companions_ and that those were they who called upon her to return; it seems rather to be given by Christ himself_ and to be designed to express his love to her and delight in her_ as before_ ch.,20250223
I. A general enquiry after such a one (v. where observe The person enquired after_ and that is a virtuous woman—a woman of strength (so the word is)_ though the weaker vessel_ yet made strong by wisdom and grace_ and the fear of God: it is the same word that is used in the character of good judges (Exod. xviii. that they are able men_ men qualified for the business to which they are called_ men of truth_ fearing God. So it follows_ A virtuous woman is a woman of spirit_ who has the command of her own spirit and knows how to manage other people's_ one that is pious and industrious_ and a help meet for a man. In opposition to this strength_ we read of the weakness of the heart of an imperious whorish woman_ Ezek. xvi,20250223
I. A general proposition laid down: To every thing there is a season_ v. 1. 1. Those things which seem most contrary the one to the other will_ in the revolution of affairs_ each take their turn and come into play. The day will give place to the night and the night again to the day. Is it summer? It will be winter. Is it winter? Stay a while_ and it will be summer. Every purpose has its time. The clearest sky will be clouded_ Post gaudia luctus—Joy succeeds sorrow; and the most clouded sky will clear up_ Post nubila Phoebus—The sun will burst from behind the cloud,20250223
I. A king is not happy unless he have wisdom_ v. 13_ 14. He that is truly wise_ prudent_ and pious_ though he be poor in the world_ and very young_ and upon both accounts despised and little taken notice of_ is better_ more truly valuable and worthy of respect_ is likely to do better for himself and to be a greater blessing to his generation_ than a king_ than an old king_ and therefore venerable both for his gravity and for his dignity_ if he be foolish_ and knows not how to manage public affairs himself nor will be admonished and advised by others—who knows not to be admonished_ that is_ will not suffer any counsel or admonition to be given him (no one about him dares contradict him) or will not hearken to the counsel and admonition that are given him. It is so far from being any part of the honour of kings that it is the greatest dishonour to them that can be not to be admonished. Folly and wilfulness commonly go together_ and those that most need admonition can worst bear it; but neither age nor titles will secure men respect if they have not true wisdom and virtue to recommend them; while wisdom and virtue will gain men honour even under the disadvantages of youth and poverty. To prove the wise child better than the foolish king he shows what each of them comes to_ v,20250223
I. A man of great modesty and humility. Though a young man_ and a man of abilities_ yet not pert_ and confident_ and assuming: his face shone_ and_ like Moses_ he did not know it_ which made it shine so much the brighter. Let it be observed by all_ especially by young people_ as worthy their imitation,20250223
I. A solemn preface_ to introduce the caution which follows_ v. 1_ 2. Solomon here addresses himself to his son_ that is_ to all young men_ as unto his children_ whom he has an affection for and some influence upon. In God's name_ he demands attention; for he writes by divine inspiration_ and is a prophet_ though he begins not with_ Thus saith the Lord. __Attend_ and bow thy ear; not only hear what is said_ and read what is written_ but apply thy mind to it and consider it diligently.__ To gain attention he urges,20250223
I. Against the lusts of the flesh. He not only kept himself clear from adultery_ from defiling his neighbour's wives (v. but from all lewdness with any women whatsoever. He kept no concubine_ no mistress_ but was inviolably faithful to the marriage bed_ though his wife was none of the wisest_ best_ or kindest. From the beginning it was so_ that a man should have but one wife and cleave to her only; and Job kept closely to that institution and abhorred the thought of transgressing it; for_ though his greatness might tempt him to it_ his goodness kept him from it. Job was now in pain and sickness of body_ and under that affliction it is in a particular manner comfortable if our consciences can witness for us that we have been careful to preserve our bodies in chastity and to possess those vessels in sanctification and honour_ pure from the lusts of uncleanness. Now observe here_,20250223
I. Agur_ having specified four things that seem great and yet are really contemptible_ here specifies four things that are little and yet are very admirable_ great in miniature_ in which_ as bishop Patrick observes_ he teaches us several good lessons; as,20250223
I. An earnest call to young people to attend to the advice of their godly parents_ not only to this that is here given_ but to all other profitable instructions: __Here_ my son_ and be wise_ v,20250223
I. An earnest exhortation to get wisdom and grace_ by attending to the words of the wise men_ both written and preached_ the words of the prophets and priests_ and particularly to that knowledge which Solomon in this book gives men of good and evil_ sin and duty_ rewards and punishments. To these words_ to this knowledge_ the ear must be bowed down in humility and serious attention and the heart applied by faith_ and love_ and close consideration. The ear will not serve without the heart.,20250223
I. An exhortation to hear and obey the voice of Wisdom_ to attend and comply with the good instructions that the word of God gives us_ and in them to discern the voice of Christ_ as the sheep know the shepherd's voice.,20250223
I. As a dying man_ surely and speedily dying. It is good for us_ when we are sick_ to think and speak of death_ for sickness is sent on purpose to put us in mind of it; and_ if we be duly mindful of it ourselves_ we may in faith put God in mind of it_ as Job does here (v. 7): O remember that my life is wind. He recommends himself to God as an object of his pity and compassion_ with this consideration_ that he was a very weak frail creature_ his abode in this world short and uncertain_ his removal out of it sure and speedy_ and his return to it again impossible and never to be expected—that his life was wind_ as the lives of all men are_ noisy perhaps and blustering_ like the wind_ but vain and empty_ soon gone_ and_ when gone_ past recall. God had compassion on Israel_ remembering that they were but flesh_ a wind that passeth away and cometh not again_ Ps. lxxviii. 38_ 39. Observe_,20250223
I. Before he describes the temptation in its strength he lays down a great and unquestionable truth_ which he resolves to adhere to_ and which_ if firmly believed_ will be sufficient to break the force of the temptation. This has been the way of God's people in grappling with this difficulty. Job_ before he discourses of this matter_ lays down the doctrine of God's omniscience (Job xxiv.,20250223
I. Believers take a great complacency in Christ_ and in communion with him. To you that believe he is precious_ above any thing in this world_ 1 Pet. ii,20250223
I. By way of instruction_ v. 6-8. He sends him to school_ for sluggards must be schooled. He is to take him to school himself_ for_ if the scholar will take no pains_ the master must take the more; the sluggard is not willing to come to school to him (dreaming scholars will never love wakeful teachers) and therefore he has found him out another school_ as low as he can desire. Observe_,20250223
I. By whom God calls to us—by wisdom. It is wisdom that crieth without. The word is plural—wisdoms_ for_ as there is infinite wisdom in God_ so there is the manifold wisdom of God_ Eph. iii,20250223
I. Concerning his dealings with man in general (v. 17_ 18): What is man_ that thou shouldst magnify him? This may be looked upon either,20250223
I. Concerning the founding of the earth. __If he have such a mighty insight_ as he pretends to have_ into the counsels of God_ let him give some account of the earth he goes upon_ which is given to the children of men.__,20250223
I. Divine wisdom gives men good heads (v. 12): I Wisdom dwell with prudence_ not with carnal policy (the wisdom that is from above is contrary to that_ 2 Cor. i. but with true discretion_ which serves for the right ordering of the conversation_ that wisdom of the prudent which is to understand his way and is in all cases profitable to direct_ the wisdom of the serpent_ not only to guard from harm_ but to guide in doing food. Wisdom dwells with prudence; for prudence is the product of religion and an ornament to religion; and there are more witty inventions found out with the help of the scripture_ both for the right understanding of God's providences and for the effectual countermining of Satan's devices and the doing of good in our generation_ than were ever discovered by the learning of the philosophers or the politics of statesmen. We may apply it to Christ himself; he dwells with prudence_ for his whole undertaking is the wisdom of God in a mystery_ and in it God abounds towards us in all wisdom and prudence. Christ found out the knowledge of that great invention_ and a costly one it was to him_ man's salvation_ by his satisfaction_ an admirable expedient. We had found out many inventions for our ruin; he found out one for our recovery. The covenant of grace is so well ordered in all things that we must conclude that he who ordered it dwelt with prudence.,20250223
I. Elihu instructs Job what he should say under his affliction_ v. 31_ 32. Having reproved him for his peevish passionate words_ he here puts better words into his mouth. When we reprove for what is amiss we must direct to what is good_ that our reproofs may be the reproofs of instruction_ Prov. vi,20250223
I. Elihu particularly charges Job with some indecent expressions that had dropped from him_ reflecting upon the justice and goodness of God in his dealings with him. He does not ground the charge upon report_ but was himself an ear-witness of what he here reproves him for (v. 8): __Thou hast spoken it in my hearing_ and in the hearing of all this company.__ He had it not at second hand; if so_ he would have hoped it was not so bad as it was represented. He did not hear it from Job in private conversation_ for then he would not have been so ill-bred as to repeat it thus publicly; but Job had said it openly_ and therefore it was fit he should be openly reproved for it. Those that sin before all rebuke before all. When we hear any thing said that tends to God's dishonour we ought publicly to bear our testimony against it. What is said amiss in our hearing we are concerned to reprove; for you are my witnesses_ saith the Lord_ to confront the accuser. 1. Job had represented himself as innocent (v. 9): Thou hast said_ I am clean without transgression. Job had not said this totidem verbis—in so many words; nay_ he had owned himself to have sinned and to be impure before God; but he had indeed said_ Thou knowest that I am not wicked_ my righteousness I hold fast_ and the like_ on which Elihu might ground this charge. It was true that Job was a perfect and an upright man and not such a one as his friends had represented him; but he ought not to have insisted so much upon it_ as if God had therefore done him wrong in afflicting him. Yet_ it should seem_ Elihu did not deal fairly in charging Job with saying that he was clean and innocent from all transgression_ when he only pleaded that he was upright and innocent from the great transgression. But those that speak passionately and unwarily must thank themselves if they be misunderstood; they should have taken more care,20250223
I. Eliphaz excuses the trouble he is now about to give to Job by his discourse (v. 2): __If we assay a word with thee_ offer a word of reproof and counsel_ wilt thou be grieved and take it ill?__ We have reason to fear thou wilt; but there is no remedy: __Who can refrain from words?__ Observe_,20250223
I. Enjoy with satisfaction the comforts of lawful marriage_ which was ordained for the prevention of uncleanness_ and therefore ought to be made use of in time_ lest it should not prove effectual for the cure of that which it might have prevented. Let none complain that God has dealt unkindly with them in forbidding them those pleasures which they have a natural desire of_ for he has graciously provided for the regular gratification of them. __Thou mayest not indeed eat of every tree of the garden_ but choose thee out one_ which thou pleasest_ and of that thou mayest freely eat; nature will be content with that_ but lust with nothing.__ God_ in thus confining men to one_ has been so far from putting any hardship upon them that he has really consulted their true interest; for_ as Mr. Herbert observes_ __If God had laid all common_ certainly man would have been the encloser.__—Church-porch. Solomon here enlarges much upon this_ not only prescribing it as an antidote_ but urging it as an argument against fornication_ that the allowed pleasures of marriage (however wicked wits may ridicule them_ who are factors for the unclean spirit) far transcend all the false forbidden pleasures of whoredom.,20250223
I. Fools talk a great deal to no purpose_ and they show their folly as much by the multitude_ impertinence_ and mischievousness of their words_ as by any thing; whereas the words of a wise man's mouth are gracious_ are grace_ manifest grace in his heart and minister grace to the hearers_ are good_ and such as become him_ and do good to all about him_ the lips of a fool not only expose him to reproach and make him ridiculous_ but will swallow up himself and bring him to ruin_ by provoking the government to take cognizance of his seditious talk and call him to an account for it. Adonijah foolishly spoke against his own life_ 1 Kings ii,20250223
I. For our preservation from evil_ from the evil of sin_ and_ consequently_ from the evil of trouble that attends it.,20250223
I. From the general condition of man upon earth (v. 1): __He is of few days_ and full of trouble. Every man must die shortly_ and every man has some reason (more or less) to desire to die shortly; and therefore why should you impute it to me as so heinous a crime that I wish to die shortly?__ Or thus: __Pray mistake not my desires of death_ as if I thought the time appointed of God could be anticipated: no_ I know very well that that is fixed; only in such language as this I take the liberty to express my present uneasiness: Is there not an appointed time (a warfare_ so the word is) to man upon earth? and are not his days here like the days of a hireling?__ Observe,20250223
I. Gives some further instances of the wickedness of these cruel bloody men. 1. Some are pirates and robbers at sea. To this many learned interpreters apply those difficult expressions (v.,20250223
I. God has thunder_ and lightning_ and rain_ and frost_ at command_ but Job has not_ and therefore let him not dare to compare himself with God_ or to contend with him. Nothing is more uncertain than what weather it shall be_ nor more out of our reach to appoint; it shall be what weather pleases God_ not what pleases us_ unless_ as becomes us_ whatever pleases God pleases us. Concerning this observe here_,20250223
I. God returned in ways of mercy to him; and his thoughts concerning him were thoughts of good and not of evil_ to give the expected (nay_ the unexpected) end_ Jer. xxix,20250223
I. God's sovereign dominion and independency laid down_ v,20250223
I. Good men are and ought to be well spoken of when they are gone; it is one of the blessings that comes upon the head of the just_ even when their head is laid. Blessed men leave behind them blessed memories. 1. It is part of the dignity of the saints_ especially those who excel in virtue and are eminently useful_ that they are remembered with respect when they are dead. Their good name_ their name with good men_ for good things_ is then in a special manner as precious ointment_ Eccl. vii. 1. Those that honour God he will thus honour_ Ps. cxii. 3_ 6_ 9. The elders by faith obtained a good report (Heb. xi. and_ being dead_ are yet spoken of,20250223
I. Good men are good for something. Though they may be poor and low in the world_ and may not have power and riches to do good with_ yet_ as long as they have a mouth to speak_ that will make them valuable and useful_ and upon that account we must honour those that fear the Lord_ because out of the good treasure of their heart they bring forth good things. 1. This makes them valuable: The tongue of the just is as choice silver; they are sincere_ freed from the dross of guile and evil design. God's words are compared to silver purified (Ps. xii. for they may be relied on; and such are the words of just men. They are of weight and worth_ and will enrich those that hear them with wisdom_ which is better than choice silver,20250223
I. He applies himself to the aged_ writes to them as fathers_ to awaken them to think of death_,20250223
I. He asserts it as an undoubted truth that wicked people may_ and often do_ prosper long in this world_ v,20250223
I. He asserts the unsearchable wisdom and irresistible power of God. It is allowed that among men there is wisdom and understanding_ v,20250223
I. He charged him with oppression and injustice_ that_ when he was in prosperity_ he not only did no good with his wealth and power_ but did a great deal of hurt with them. This was utterly false_ as appears by the account Job gives of himself (ch. xxix. 12_ &c.) and the character God gave of him_ ch. i. And yet_,20250223
I. He charges him with folly and absurdity (v. 2_ that_ whereas he had been reputed a wise man_ he had now quite forfeited his reputation; any one would say that his wisdom had departed from him_ he talked so extravagantly and so little to the purpose. Bildad began thus (ch. viii. and Zophar_ ch. xi. 2_ 3. It is common for angry disputants thus to represent one another's reasonings as impertinent and ridiculous more than there is cause_ forgetting the doom of him that calls his brother Raca_ and Thou fool. It is true,20250223
I. He charges him with idle endless talk_ as Eliphaz had done (ch. xv. 2_ 3): How long will it be ere you make an end of words? v,20250223
I. He comes up with them as one that understood the matter in dispute as well as they_ and did not need to be taught by them_ v. 1_ 2. They compelled him_ as the Corinthians did Paul_ to commend himself and his own knowledge_ yet not in a way of self-applause_ but of self-justification. All he had before said his eye had seen confirmed by many instances_ and his ear had heard seconded by many authorities_ and he well understood it and what use to make of it. Happy are those who not only see and hear_ but understand_ the greatness_ glory_ and sovereignty of God. This_ he thought_ would justify what he had said before (ch. xii. which he repeats here (v. 2): __What you know_ the same do I know also_ so that I need not come to you to be taught; I am not inferior unto you in wisdom.__ Note_ Those who enter into disputation enter into temptation to magnify themselves and vilify their brethren more than is fit_ and therefore ought to watch and pray against the workings of pride.,20250223
I. He complains of the particular hardships he apprehended himself under from the strictness of God's justice_ v. 16_ 17. Therefore he longed to go hence to that world where God's wrath will be past_ because now he was under the continual tokens of it_ as a child_ under the severe discipline of the rod_ longs to be of age. __When shall my change come? For now thou seemest to me to number my steps_ and watch over my sin_ and seal it up in a bag_ as bills of indictment are kept safely_ to be produced against the prisoner.__ See Deut. xxxii,20250223
I. He complains of the tokens of God's displeasure which he was under_ and which infused the wormwood and gall into the affliction and misery. How doleful are the accents of his complaints! __He hath kindled his wrath against me_ which flames and terrifies me_ which burns and pains me___,20250223
I. He conducted himself like a man under his afflictions_ not stupid and senseless_ like a stock or stone_ not unnatural and unaffected at the death of his children and servants; no (v. he arose_ and rent his mantle_ and shaved his head_ which were the usual expressions of great sorrow_ to show that he was sensible of the hand of the Lord that had gone out against him; yet he did not break out into any indecencies_ nor discover any extravagant passion. He did not faint away_ but arose_ as a champion to the combat; he did not_ in a heat_ throw off his clothes_ but very gravely_ in conformity to the custom of the country_ rent his mantle_ his cloak_ or outer garment; he did not passionately tear his hair_ but deliberately shaved his head. By all this it appeared that he kept his temper_ and bravely maintained the possession and repose of his own soul_ in the midst of all these provocations. The time when he began to show his feelings is observable; it was not till he heard of the death of his children_ and then he arose_ then he rent his mantle. A worldly unbelieving heart would have said_ __Now that the meat is gone it is well that the mouths are gone too; now that there are no portions it is well that there are no children:__ but Job knew better_ and would have been thankful if Providence had spared his children_ though he had little of nothing for them_ for Jehovah-jireh—the Lord will provide. Some expositors_ remembering that it was usual with the Jews to rend their clothes when they heard blasphemy_ conjecture that Job rent his clothes in a holy indignation at the blasphemous thoughts which Satan now cast into his mind_ tempting him to curse God.,20250223
I. He desires to hear often from her. She is ready at her pen; she must be sure to write to him; she knows how to direct (v. 13): __Thou that_ for the present_ dwellest in the gardens_ dressing and keeping them till thou remove from the garden below to the paradise above—thou_ O believer! whoever thou art_ that dwellest in the gardens of solemn ordinances_ in the gardens of church-fellowship and communion_ the companions are so happy as to hear thy voice_ cause me to hear it too.__ Observe,20250223
I. He does not think it below him to take notice of the meanest of his subjects_ nor does poverty or obscurity set any at a distance from his favour. If men are mighty_ they are apt to look with a haughty disdain upon those that are not of distinction and make no figure; but God is mighty_ infinitely so_ and yet he despises not any_ v,20250223
I. He durst not dispute with God (v. 14): __If the proud helpers do stoop under him_ how much less shall I (a poor weak creature_ so far from being a helper that I am very helpless) answer him?,20250223
I. He entreats his friends and all the company to let him alone_ and not interrupt him in what he was about to say (v. but diligently to hearken to it_ v,20250223
I. He gives him good counsel (v. 13_ as Eliphaz did (ch. v. and Bildad_ ch. viii,20250223
I. He grants that the products of the earth_ for the support and comfort of human life_ are valuable things (v. 9): The profit of the earth is for all. Man's body_ being made of the earth_ thence has its maintenance (Job xxviii. 5); and that it has so_ and that a barren land is not made his dwelling (as he has deserved for being rebellious_ Ps. lxviii. is an instance of God's great bounty to him. There is profit to be got out of the earth_ and it is for all; all need it; it is appointed for all; there is enough for all. It is not only for all men_ but for all the inferior creatures; the same ground brings grass for the cattle that brings herbs for the service of men. Israel had bread from heaven_ angels' food_ but (which is a humbling consideration) the earth is our storehouse and the beasts are fellow-commoners with us. The king himself is served of the field_ and would be ill served_ would be quite starved_ without its products. This puts a great honour upon the husbandman's calling_ that it is the most necessary of all to the support of man's life. The many have the benefit of it; the mighty cannot live without it; it is for all; it is for the king himself. Those that have an abundance of the fruits of the earth must remember they are for all_ and therefore must look upon themselves but as stewards of their abundance_ out of which they must give to those that need. Dainty meats and soft clothing are only for some_ but the fruit of the earth is for all. And even those that suck the abundance of the seas (Deut. xxxiii. 19) cannot be without the fruit of the earth_ while those that have a competency of the fruit of the earth may despise the abundance of the seas.,20250223
I. He grants the temptation to be strong (v. 7): Surely it is often too true that oppression makes a wise man mad. If a wise man be much and long oppressed_ he is very apt to speak and act unlike himself_ to lay the reins on the neck of his passions_ and break out into indecent complaints against God and man_ or to make use of unlawful dishonourable means of relieving himself. The righteous_ when the rod of the wicked rests long on their lot_ are in danger of putting forth their hands to iniquity_ Ps. cxxv,20250223
I. He had the testimony of his conscience for him that he had walked uprightly_ and had never allowed himself in any gross sin. None was ever more ready than he to acknowledge his sins of infirmity; but_ upon search_ he could not charge himself with any enormous crime_ for which he should be made more miserable than other men_ v. 17.,20250223
I. He here describes their prosperity in the height_ and breadth_ and length of it. __If this be true_ as you say_ pray tell me wherefore do the wicked live?__ v. 7.,20250223
I. He here sends us to the house of God_ to the place of public worship_ to the temple_ which he himself had built at a vast expense. When he reflected with regret on all his other works (ch. ii.,20250223
I. He is still most passionately desirous to die_ as if it were not possible that he should ever see good days again in this world_ or that_ by the exercise of grace and devotion_ he might make even these days of affliction good days. He could see no end of his trouble but death_ and had not patience to wait the time appointed for that. He has a request to make; there is a thing he longs for (v. 8); and what is that? One would think it should be_ __That it would please God to deliver me_ and restore me to my prosperity again;__ no_ That it would please God to destroy me_ v,20250223
I. He justifies his own resentments of his trouble (v. 2): Even to day_ I own_ my complaint is bitter; for the affliction_ the cause of the complaint_ is so. There are wormwood and gall in the affliction and misery; my soul has them still in remembrance and is embittered by them_ Lam. iii. 19_ 20. Even to day is my complaint counted rebellion (so some read it); his friends construed the innocent expressions of his grief into reflections upon God and his providence_ and called them rebellion. __But___ says he_ __I do not complain more than there is cause; for my stroke is heavier than my groaning. Even today_ after all you have said to convince and comfort me_ still the pains of my body and the wounds of my spirit are such that I have reason enough for my complaints_ if they were more bitter than they are.__ We wrong God if our groaning be heavier than our stroke_ like froward children_ who_ when they cry for nothing_ have justly something given them to cry for; but we do not wrong ourselves though our stroke be heavier than our groaning_ for little said is soon amended.,20250223
I. He lays down good truths_ and truths which were capable of a good improvement_ v. 13_ 14.,20250223
I. He lays this down for a truth_ that man is an unequal match for his Maker_ either in dispute or combat.,20250223
I. He opposes this to what his friends had maintained concerning their certain ruin in this life.,20250223
I. He owns and laments the deficiencies of his wisdom. He had wisdom enough to see the vanity of the world and to experience that that would not make a portion for a soul. But_ when he came to enquire further_ he found himself at a loss; his eye was too dim_ his line was too short_ and_ though he discovered this_ there were many other things which he could not prove by wisdom.,20250223
I. He pronounces her truly amiable (v. 4): Thou art beautiful_ O my love! as Tirzah_ a city in the tribe of Manasseh_ whose name signifies pleasant_ or acceptable_ the situation_ no doubt_ being very happy and the building fine and uniform. Thou art comely as Jerusalem_ a city compact together (Ps. cxxii. and which Solomon had built and beautified_ the joy of the whole earth; it was an honour to the world (whether they thought so or no) that there was such a city in it. It was the holy city_ and that was the greatest beauty of it; and fitly is the church compared to it_ for it was figured and typified by it. The gospel-church is the Jerusalem that is above (Gal. iv. the heavenly Jerusalem (Heb. xii. 22); in it God has his sanctuary_ and is_ in a special manner_ present; thence he has the tribute of praise issuing; it is his rest for ever_ and therefore it is comely as Jerusalem_ and_ being so_ is terrible as an army with banners. Church-censures_ duly administered_ strike an awe upon men's consciences; the word (the weapons of her warfare) casts down imaginations (2 Cor. x. and even an unbeliever is convinced and judged by the solemnity of holy ordinances_ 1 Cor. xiv. 24_ 25. The saints by faith overcome the world (1 John v. 4); nay_ like Jacob_ they have power with God and prevail_ Gen. xxxii. 28.,20250223
I. He protests that he never set his heart upon the wealth of this world_ nor took the things of it for his portions and happiness. He had gold; he had fine gold. His wealth was great_ and he had gotten much. Our wealth is either advantageous or pernicious to us according as we stand affected to it. If we make it our rest and our ruler_ it will be our ruin; if we make it our servant_ and an instrument of righteousness_ it will be a blessing to us. Job here tells us how he stood affected to his worldly wealth. 1. He put no great confidence in it: he did not make gold his hope_ v,20250223
I. He proves this truth_ of the certain destruction of all the hopes and joys of hypocrites_ by an appeal to antiquity and the concurring sentiment and observation of all wise and good men; and an undoubted truth it is_ if we take in the other world_ that_ if not in this life_ yet in the life to come_ hypocrites will be deprived of all their trusts and all their triumphs: whether Bildad so meant or no_ we must so take it. Let us observe the method of his proof_ v. 8-10.,20250223
I. He provokes him to curse God by smiting him with sore boils_ and so making him a burden to himself_ v. 7_ 8. The former attack was extremely violent_ but Job kept his ground_ bravely made good the pass and carried the day. Yet he is still but girding on the harness; there is worse behind. The clouds return after the rain. Satan_ by the divine permission_ follows his blow_ and now deep calls unto deep.,20250223
I. He reminds him that no affliction comes by chance_ nor is to be attributed to second causes: It doth not come forth of the dust_ nor spring out of the ground_ as the grass doth_ v,20250223
I. He repeats his text (v. 8),20250223
I. He represents Job otherwise than what he was_ v. 2_ 3. He would have him thought idle and impertinent in his discourse_ and one that loved to hear himself talk; he gives him the lie_ and calls him a mocker; and all this that it might be looked upon as a piece of justice to chastise him. Those that have a mind to fall out with their brethren_ and to fall foul upon them_ find it necessary to put the worst colours they can upon them and their performances_ and_ right or wrong_ to make them odious. We have read and considered Job's discourses in the foregoing chapters_ and have found them full of good sense and much to the purpose_ that his principles are right_ his reasonings strong_ many of his expressions weighty and very considerable_ and that what there is in them of heat and passion a little candour and charity will excuse and overlook; and yet Zophar here invidiously represents him,20250223
I. He represents his calamity_ in general_ as much heavier than either he had expressed it or they had apprehended it_ v. 2_ 3. He could not fully describe it; they would not fully apprehend it_ or at least would not own that they did; and therefore he would gladly appeal to a third person_ who had just weights and just balances with which to weigh his grief and calamity_ and would do it with an impartial hand. He wished that they would set his grief and all the expressions of it in one scale_ his calamity and all the particulars of it in the other_ and (though he would not altogether justify himself in his grief) they would find (as he says_ ch. xxiii. 2) that his stroke was heavier than his groaning; for_ whatever his grief was_ his calamity was heavier than the sand of the sea: it was complicated_ it was aggravated_ every grievance weighty_ and all together numerous as the sand. __Therefore (says he) my words are swallowed up;__ that is_ __Therefore you must excuse both the brokenness and the bitterness of my expressions. Do not think it strange if my speech be not so fine and polite as that of an eloquent orator_ or so grave and regular as that of a morose philosopher: no_ in these circumstances I can pretend neither to the one nor to the other; my words are_ as I am_ quite swallowed up.__ Now,20250223
I. He represents the fallacious reasonings which sinners use in their enticements_ and the arts of wheedling which they have for the beguiling of unstable souls. He specifies highwaymen_ who do what they can to draw others into their gang_ v. 11-14. See here what they would have the young man to do: __Come with us (v. 11); let us have thy company.__ At first they pretend to ask no more; but the courtship rises higher (v. 14): __Cast in thy lot among us; come in partner with us_ join thy force to ours_ and let us resolve to live and die together: thou shalt fare as we fare; and let us all have one purse_ that what we get together we may spend merrily together___ for that is it they aim at. Two unreasonable insatiable lusts they propose to themselves the gratification of_ and therewith entice their pray into the snare:—1. Their cruelty. They thirst after blood_ and hate those that are innocent and never gave them any provocation_ because by their honesty and industry they shame and condemn them: __Let us therefore lay wait for their blood_ and lurk privily for them; they are conscious to themselves of no crime and consequently apprehensive of no danger_ but travel unarmed; therefore we shall make the more easy prey of them. And_ O how sweet it will be to swallow them up alive!__,20250223
I. He represents the work of God_ in general_ as illustrious and conspicuous_ v,20250223
I. He resolved to try what mirth would do and the pleasures of wit_ whether he should be happy if he constantly entertained himself and others with merry stories and jests_ banter and drollery; if he should furnish himself with all the pretty ingenious turns and repartees he could invent or pick up_ fit to be laughed over_ and all the bulls_ and blunders_ and foolish things_ he could hear of_ fit to be ridiculed and laughed at_ so that he might be always in a merry humour. 1. This experiment made (v. 1): __Finding that in much wisdom is much grief_ and that those who are serious are apt to be melancholy_ I said in my heart__ (to my heart)_ __Go to now_ I will prove thee with mirth; I will try if that will give thee satisfaction.__ Neither the temper of his mind nor his outward condition had any thing in them to keep him from being merry_ but both agreed_ as did all other advantages_ to further it; therefore he resolved to take a lease this way_ and said_ __Enjoy pleasure_ and take thy fill of it; cast away care_ and resolve to be merry.__ So a man may be_ and yet have none of these fine things which he here got to entertain himself with; many that are poor are very merry; beggars in a barn are so to a proverb. Mirth is the entertainment of the fancy_ and_ though it comes short of the solid delights of the rational powers_ yet it is to be preferred before those that are merely carnal and sensual. Some distinguish man from the brutes_ not only as animal rationale—a rational animal_ but as animal risibile—a laughing animal; therefore he that said to his soul_ Take thy ease_ eat and drink_ added_ And be merry_ for it was in order to that that he would eat and drink. __Try therefore___ says Solomon_ __to laugh and be fat_ to laugh and be happy.__ 2. The judgment he passed upon this experiment: Behold_ this also is vanity_ like all the rest; it yields no true satisfaction_ v,20250223
I. He sets himself to consider both wisdom and folly. He had considered these before (ch. i.,20250223
I. He shows how glorious God is_ and thence infers how guilty and impure man is before him_ v. 2-4. Let us see then,20250223
I. He shows how unable Job was to master the leviathan. 1. That he could not catch him_ as a little fish_ with angling_ v. 1_ 2. He had no bait wherewith to deceive him_ no hook wherewith to catch him_ no fish-line wherewith to draw him out of the water_ nor a thorn to run through his gills_ on which to carry him home,20250223
I. He shows the advantages which the living have above those that are dead_ v. 4-6. 1. While there is life there is hope. Dum spiro_ spero—While I breathe_ I hope. It is the privilege of the living that they are joined to the living_ in relation_ commerce_ and conversation_ and_ while they are so_ there is hope. If a man's condition be_ upon any account_ bad_ there is hope it will be amended. If the heart be full of evil_ and madness be in it_ yet while there is life there is hope that by the grace of God there may be a blessed change wrought; but after men go to the dead (v. 3) it is too late then; he that is then filthy will be filthy still_ for ever filthy. If men be thrown aside as useless_ yet_ while they are joined to the living_ there is hope that they may yet again take root and bear fruit; he that is alive is_ or may be_ good for something_ but he that is dead_ as to this world_ is not capable of being any further serviceable. Therefore a living dog is better than a dead lion; the meanest beggar alive has that comfort of this world and does that service to it which the greatest prince_ when he is dead_ is utterly incapable of,20250223
I. He shows what reason he had to expect kindness from them. His expectation was grounded upon the common principles of humanity (v. 14): __To him that is afflicted_ and that is wasting and melting under his affliction_ pity should be shown from his friend; and he that does not show that pity forsakes the fear of the Almighty.__ Note,20250223
I. He specifies four other things which are insatiable_ to which those devourers are compared_ which say not_ It is enough_ or It is wealth. Those are never rich that are always coveting. Now these four things that are always craving are,20250223
I. He subscribes to the truth of God's unlimited power_ knowledge_ and dominion_ to prove which was the scope of God's discourse out of the whirlwind_ v,20250223
I. He tells him what God would have done for him before this if he had been duly humbled under his affliction. __We all know how ready God is to deliver the poor in his affliction (v. 15); he always was so. The poor in spirit_ those that are of a broken and contrite heart_ he looks upon with tenderness_ and_ when they are in affliction_ is ready to help them. He opens their ears_ and makes them to hear joy and gladness_ even in their oppressions; while he does not yet deliver them he speaks to them good words and comfortable words_ for the encouragement of their faith and patience_ the silencing of their fears_ and the balancing of their griefs; and even so (v. 16) would he have done to thee if thou hadst submitted to his providence and conducted thyself well; he would have delivered and comforted thee_ and we should have had none of these complaints. If thou hadst accommodated thyself to the will of God_ thy liberty and plenty would have been restored to thee with advantage.__ 1. __Thou wouldst have been enlarged_ and not confined thus by thy sickness and disgrace: He would have removed thee into a broad place where is no straitness_ and thou wouldst no longer have been cramped thus and have had all thy measures broken.__ 2. __Thou wouldst have been enriched_ and wouldst not have been left in this poor condition; thou wouldst have had thy table richly spread_ not only with food convenient_ but with the finest of the wheat__ (see Deut.,20250223
I. He tells us how he startled at the thought of it_ for he looked upon the condition of a hypocrite and a wicked man to be certainly the most miserable condition that any man could be in (v. 7): Let my enemy be as the wicked_ a proverbial expression_ like that (Dan. iv.,20250223
I. He thinks it hard_ in general_ that miserable lives should be prolonged (v. 20-22): Wherefore is light in life given to those that are bitter in soul? Bitterness of soul_ through spiritual grievances_ makes life itself bitter. Why doth he give light? (so it is in the original): he means God_ yet does not name him_ though the devil had said_ __He will curse thee to thy face;__ but he tacitly reflects on the divine Providence as unjust and unkind in continuing life when the comforts of life are removed. Life is called light_ because pleasant and serviceable for walking and working. It is candle-light; the longer it burns the shorter it is_ and the nearer to the socket. This light is said to be given us; for_ if it were not daily renewed to us by a fresh gift_ it would be lost. But Job reckons that to those who are in misery it is doron adoron—gift and no gift_ a gift that they had better be without_ while the light only serves them to see their own misery by. Such is the vanity of human life that it sometimes becomes a vexation of spirit; and so alterable is the property of death that_ though dreadful to nature_ it may become desirable even to nature itself. He here speaks of those,20250223
I. He ungratefully quarrels with life_ and is angry that it was not taken from him as soon as it was given him (v. 11_ 12): Why died not I from the womb? See here,20250223
I. He upbraids them with their conceitedness of themselves_ and the good opinion they seemed to have of their own wisdom in comparison with him_ than which nothing is more weak and unbecoming_ nor better deserves to be ridiculed_ as it is here. 1. He represents them as claiming the monopoly of wisdom_ v,20250223
I. He would not have us to be surprised at it_ as though some strange thing happened_ for he himself saw it in his days_ v,20250223
I. Hear this_ That God is not to be quarrelled with for any thing that he does. It is daring presumption to arraign and condemn God's proceedings_ as Job had done by his discontents. It was_,20250223
I. Her expostulation with the young prince_ by which she lays hold of him_ claims an interest in him_ and awakens his attention to what she is about to say (v. 2): __What! my son? What shall I say to thee?__ She speaks as one considering what advice to give him_ and choosing out words to reason with him; so full of concern is she for his welfare! Or_ What is it that thou doest? It seems to be a chiding question. She observed_ when he was young_ that he was too much inclined to women and wine_ and therefore she found it necessary to take him to task and deal roundly with him. __What! my son? Is this the course of life thou intendest to lead? Have I taught thee no better than thus? I must reprove thee_ and reprove thee sharply_ and thou must take it well_ for___ 1. __Thou art descended from me; thou art the son of my womb_ and therefore what I say comes from the authority and affection of a parent and cannot be suspected to come from any ill-will. Thou art a piece of myself. I bore thee with sorrow_ and I expect no other return for all the pains I have taken with thee_ and undergone for thee_ than this_ Be wise and good_ and then I am well paid.__ 2. __Thou art devoted to my God; thou art the son of my vows_ the son I prayed to God to give me and promised to give back to God_ and did so__ (thus Samuel was the son of Hannah's vows); __Thou art the son I have often prayed to God to give his grace to (Ps. lxxii. 1)_ and shall a child of so many prayers miscarry? And shall all my hopes concerning thee be disappointed?__ Our children that by baptism are dedicated to God_ for whom and in whose name we covenanted with God_ may well be called the children of our vows; and_ as this may be made a good plea with God in our prayers for them_ so it may be made a good plea with them in the instructions we give them; we may tell them they are baptized_ are the children of our vows_ and it is at their peril if they break those bonds in sunder which in their infancy they were solemnly brought under.,20250223
I. Here is good counsel given about going to law:—1. __Be not hasty in bringing an action_ before thou hast thyself considered it_ and consulted with thy friends about it: Go not forth hastily to strive; do not send for a writ in a passion_ or upon the first appearance of right on thy side_ but weigh the matter deliberately_ because we are apt to be partial in our own cause; consider the certainty of the expenses and the uncertainty of the success_ how much care and vexation it will be the occasion of_ and_ after all_ the cause may go against thee; surely then thou shouldst not go forth hastily to strive.__ 2. __Bring not an action before thou hast tried to end the matter amicably ( v. 9): Debate thy cause with thy neighbour privately_ and perhaps you will understand one another better and see that there is no occasion to go to law.__ In public quarrels the war that must at length end might better have been prevented by a treaty of peace_ and a great deal of blood and treasure spared. It is so in private quarrels: __Sue not thy neighbour as a heathen man and a publican until thou hast told him his fault between thee and him alone_ and he has refused to refer the matter_ or to come to an accommodation. Perhaps the matter in variance is a secret_ not fit to be divulged to any_ much less to be brought upon the stage before the country; and therefore end it privately_ that it may not be discovered.__ Reveal not the secret of another_ so some read it. __Do not_ in revenge_ to disgrace thy adversary_ disclose that which should be kept private and which does not at all belong to the cause.__,20250223
I. Here is much that he complains of.,20250223
I. Here is the vanity of man as mighty_ man in his best estate_ man upon the throne_ where his authority is submitted to_ man upon the judgment-seat_ where his wisdom and justice are appealed to_ and where_ if he be governed by the laws of religion_ he is God's vicegerent; nay_ he is of those to whom it is said_ You are gods; but without the fear of God it is vanity_ for_ set that aside_ and_,20250223
I. His complaint here of the passing away of the days of his prosperity is proper enough (v. 25_ 26): __My days (that is_ all my good days) are gone_ never to return_ gone of a sudden_ gone ere I was aware. Never did any courier that went express__ (like Cushi and Ahimaaz) __with good tidings make such haste as all my comforts did from me. Never did ship sail to its port_ never did eagle fly upon its prey_ with such incredible swiftness; nor does there remain any trace of my prosperity_ any more than there does of an eagle in the air or a ship in the sea___ Prov. xxx,20250223
I. His great comfort in his children is taken notice of as an instance of his prosperity; for our temporal comforts are borrowed_ depend upon others_ and are as those about us are. Job himself mentions it as one of the greatest joys of his prosperous estate that his children were about him_ ch. xxix,20250223
I. His personality and distinct subsistence_ one with the Father and of the same essence_ and yet a person of himself_ whom the Lord possessed (v. who was set up (v. was brought forth (v. 24_ was by him (v. for he was the express image of his person_ Heb. i. 3.,20250223
I. His solemn preface to this discourse_ in which he bespeaks Job's attention_ which he had little reason to expect_ he having given so little heed to and put so little value upon what Job had said (v. 17): __I will show thee that which is worth hearing_ and not reason_ as thou dost_ with unprofitable talk.__ Thus apt are men_ when they condemn the reasonings of others_ to commend their own. He promises to teach him,20250223
I. Holiness. A little_ if we manage it and enjoy it in the fear of the Lord_ if we keep a good conscience and go on in the way of duty_ and serve God faithfully with the little we have_ will be more comfortable_ and turn to a better account_ than great treasure and trouble therewith. Observe here,20250223
I. How Job eyes God as his Creator and preserver_ and describes his dependence upon him as the author and upholder of his being. This is one of the first things we are all concerned to know and consider.,20250223
I. How he describes their unkindness to him and what account he gives of it. 1. They vexed his soul_ and that is more grievous than the vexation of the bones_ Ps. vi. 2_ 3. They were his friends; they came to comfort him_ pretended to counsel him for the best; but with a great deal of gravity_ and affectation of wisdom and piety_ they set themselves to rob him of the only comfort he had now left him in a good God_ a good conscience_ and a good name; and this vexed him to his heart.,20250223
I. How he dissuades the covetous man from toiling and tormenting himself (v. 4). __Do not aim to be rich_ to raise an estate_ and to make what thou hast in abundance more than it is.__ We must endeavor to live comfortably_ and provide for our children and families_ according as our rank and condition are_ but we must not seek great things. Be not of those that will be rich_ that desire it as their chief good and design it as their highest end_ 1 Tim. vi,20250223
I. How much soever we toil about the world_ and get out of it_ we can have for ourselves no more than a maintenance (v. 7): All the labour of man is for his mouth_ which craves it of him (Prov.,20250223
I. How much the happiness of a land depends upon the character of its rulers; it is well or ill with the people according as the princes are good or bad. 1. The people cannot be happy when their princes are childish and voluptuous (v. 16): Woe unto thee_ O land! even the land of Canaan itself_ though otherwise the glory of all lands_ when thy king is a child_ not so much in age (Solomon himself was young when his kingdom was happy in him) as in understanding; when the prince is weak and foolish as a child_ fickle and fond of changes_ fretful and humoursome_ easily imposed upon_ and hardly brought to business_ it is ill with the people. The body staggers if the head be giddy. Perhaps Solomon wrote this with a foresight of his son Rehoboam's ill conduct (2 Chron.,20250223
I. How plainly this truth is laid down_ both negatively and positively. 1. He does wrong to none: God cannot do wickedness_ nor the Almighty commit iniquity_ v,20250223
I. How the duty itself is recommended to us_ v. 1. 1. Cast thy bread upon the waters_ thy bread-corn upon the low places (so some understand it)_ alluding to the husbandman_ who goes forth_ bearing precious seed_ sparing bread-corn from his family for the seedness_ knowing that without that he can have no harvest another year; thus the charitable man takes from his bread-corn for seed-corn_ abridges himself to supply the poor_ that he may sow beside all waters (Isa. xxxii.,20250223
I. How the spouse sought him in vain upon her bed (v. 1); when she was up and looking about her_ grace in act and exercise_ though her beloved was withdrawn_ yet she could see him at a distance (ch. ii. but now it was otherwise. She still continued her affection to him_ still it was he whom her soul loved_ that bond of the covenant still continued firm. __Though he slay me_ I will trust in him; though he leave me_ I will love him. When I have him not in my arms_ I have him in my heart.__ But she wanted the communion she used to have with him_ as David when he thirsted for God_ for the living God. She sought him_ but,20250223
I. If a man be acute_ and dexterous_ and successful in his business_ he gets the ill-will of his neighbours_ v,20250223
I. In the snow and rain_ v,20250223
I. It shall be as ill with the wicked as they can fear_ and as well with the righteous as they can desire. 1. The wicked_ it is true_ buoy themselves up sometimes in their wickedness with vain hopes which will deceive them_ but at other times they cannot but be haunted with just fears_ and those fears shall come upon them; the God they provoke will be every whit as terrible as they_ when they are under their greatest damps_ apprehend him to be. As is thy fear_ so is thy wrath_ Ps. xc,20250223
I. Job here undertakes to set this matter in a true light (v. 11_ 12): I will teach you. We must not disdain to learn even from those who are sick and poor_ yea_ and peevish too_ if they deliver what is true and good. Observe,20250223
I. Job opposes the opinion of his friends_ which he saw they still adhered to_ that the wicked are sure to fall into such visible and remarkable ruin as Job had now fallen into_ and none but the wicked_ upon which principle they condemned Job as a wicked man. __I know your thoughts___ says Job (v. 27); __I know you will not agree with me; for your judgments are tinctured and biassed by your piques and prejudices against me_ and the devices which you wrongfully imagine against my comfort and honour: and how can such men be convinced?__ Job's friends were ready to say_ in answer to his discourse concerning the prosperity of the wicked_ __Where is the house of the prince?,20250223
I. Job's passionate complaints. On this harsh and unpleasant string he harps much_ in which_ though he cannot be justified_ he may be excused. He complained not for nothing_ as the murmuring Israelites_ but had cause to complain. If we think it looks ill in him_ let it be a warning to us to keep our temper better.,20250223
I. Judgment given against Job's three friends_ upon the controversy between them and Job. Elihu is not censured here_ for he distinguished himself from the rest in the management of the dispute_ and acted_ not as a party_ but as a moderator; and moderation will have its praise with God_ whether it have with men or no. In the judgment here given Job is magnified and his three friends are mortified. While we were examining the discourses on both sides we could not discern_ and therefore durst not determine_ who was in the right; something of truth we thought they both had on their side_ but we could not cleave the hair between them; nor would we_ for all the world_ have had to give the decisive sentence upon the case_ lest we should have determined wrong. But it is well that the judgment is the Lord's_ and we are sure that his judgment is according to truth; to it we will refer ourselves_ and by it we will abide. Now_ in the judgment here given_,20250223
I. Let not subjects carry on a quarrel with their prince upon any private personal disgust (v. 4): __If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee_ if upon some misinformation given him_ or some mismanagement of thine_ he is displeased at thee_ and threaten thee_ yet leave not thy place_ forget not the duty of a subject_ revolt not from thy allegiance_ do not_ in a passion_ quit thy post in his service and throw up thy commission_ as despairing ever to regain his favour. No_ wait awhile_ and thou wilt find he is not implacable_ but that yielding pacifies great offences.__ Solomon speaks for himself_ and for every wise and good man that is a master_ or a magistrate_ that he could easily forgive those_ upon their submission_ whom yet_ upon their provocation_ he had been very angry with. It is safer and better to yield to an angry prince than to contend with him.,20250223
I. Let them have regard to God as their supreme.,20250223
I. Many illustrious instances are here given of the wisdom and power of God in the creation and preservation of the world.,20250223
I. Of dissimulation and hypocrisy. The general crime of which his friends accused him was that_ under the cloak of a profession of religion_ he had kept up secret haunts of sin_ and that really he was as bad as other people_ but had the art of concealing it. Zophar insinuated (ch. xx. 12) that he hid his iniquity under his tongue. __No___ says Job_ __I never did (v.,20250223
I. Of the original of human life. God is indeed its great original_ for he breathed into man the breath of life and in him we live; but we date it from our birth_ and thence we must date both its frailty and its pollution. 1. Its frailty: Man_ that is born of a woman_ is therefore of few days_ v. 1. This may refer to the first woman_ who was called Eve_ because she was the mother of all living. Of her_ who being deceived by the tempter was first in the transgression_ we are all born_ and consequently derive from her that sin and corruption which both shorten our days and sadden them. Or it may refer to every man's immediate mother. The woman is the weaker vessel_ and we know that partus sequitur ventrem—the child takes after the mother. Let not the strong man therefore glory in his strength_ or in the strength of his father_ but remember that he is born of a woman_ and that_ when God pleases_ the mighty men become as women_ Jer. li. 30,20250223
I. Of the person tempted_ and how he laid himself open to the temptation_ and therefore must thank himself if it end in his destruction. 1. He was a young man_ v,20250223
I. Of the springs of the morning_ the day-spring from on high_ v. 12-15. As there is no visible being of which we may be more firmly assured that it is_ so there is none which we are more puzzled in describing_ nor more doubtful in determining what it is_ than the light. We welcome the morning_ and are glad of the day-spring; but,20250223
I. Satan among the sons of God (v. an adversary (so Satan signifies) to God_ to men_ to all good: he thrust himself into an assembly of the sons of God that came to present themselves before the Lord. This means either,20250223
I. Satan brought them upon him on the very day that his children began their course of feasting_ at their eldest brother's house (v. where_ he having (we may suppose) the double portion_ the entertainment was the richest and most plentiful. The whole family_ no doubt_ was in perfect repose_ and all were easy and under no apprehension of the trouble_ now when they revived this custom; and this time Satan chose_ that the trouble_ coming now_ might be the more grievous. The night of my pleasure has he turned into fear_ Isa. xxi. 4.,20250223
I. See here what God is_ and let him be adored.,20250223
I. See here what his thoughts were in his prosperity (v. 18): Then I said_ I shall die in my nest. Having made himself a warm and easy nest_ he hoped nothing would disturb him in it_ nor remove him out of it_ till death removed him. He knew he had never stolen any coal from the altar which might fire his nest; he saw no storm arising to shake down his nest; and therefore concluded_ To morrow shall be as this day; as David (Ps. xxx.,20250223
I. See him disheartened and weakened by continual terrors arising from the sense of his own guilt and the dread of God's wrath (v. 11_ 12): Terror shall make him afraid on every side. The terrors of his own conscience shall haunt him_ so that he shall never be easy. Wherever he goes_ these shall follow him; which way soever he looks_ these shall stare him in the face. It will make him tremble to see himself fought against by the whole creation_ to see Heaven frowning on him_ hell gaping for him_ and earth sick of him. He that carries his own accuser_ and his own tormentor_ always in his bosom_ cannot but be afraid on every side. This will drive him to his feet_ like the malefactor_ who_ being conscious of his own guilt_ takes to his heels and flees when none pursues_ Prov. xxviii. 1. But his feet will do him no service; they are fast in the snare_ v,20250223
I. She here triumphs in her relation to Christ and her interest in him_ and in his name will she boast all the day long. With what a transport of joy and holy exultation does she say (v.,20250223
I. She owns her dependence upon Christ himself to make this garden fruitful. To him she has an eye (v. 15) as the fountain of gardens_ not only the founder of them_ by whom they are planted and to whom they owe their being_ but the fountain of them_ by which they are watered and to which they own their continuance and well-being_ and without whose constant supplies they would soon become like the dry and barren wilderness. To him she gives all the glory of her fruitfulness_ as being nothing with out him: O fountain of gardens! fountain of all good_ of all grace_ do not thou fail me. Does a believer say to the church_ All my springs are in thee_ in thee_ O Zion? (Ps. lxxxvii.,20250223
I. She rejoices in his approach_ v,20250223
I. Silence is here recommended as an instance of true friendship_ and a preservative of it_ and therefore an evidence,20250223
I. Solomon here gives an instance_ which probably was a case in fact_ in some neighbouring country_ of a poor man who with his wisdom did great service in a time of public distress and danger (v. 14): There was a little city (no great prize_ whoever was master of it); there were but few men within it_ to defend it_ and men_ if men of fortitude_ are the best fortifications of a city; here were few men_ and_ because few_ feeble_ fearful_ and ready to give up their city as not tenable. Against this little city a great king came with a numerous army_ and besieged it_ either in pride_ or covetousness to possess it_ or in revenge for some affront given him_ to chastise and destroy it. Thinking it stronger than it was_ he built great bulwarks against it_ from which to batter it_ and doubted not but in a little time to make himself master of it. What a great deal of unjust vexation do ambitious princes give to their harmless neighbours! This great king needed not fear this little city; why then should he frighten it? It would be little profit to him; why then should he put himself to such a great expense to gain it? But as unreasonable and insatiably greedy as little people sometimes are to lay house to house_ and field to field_ great kings often are to lay city to city_ and province to province_ that they may be placed alone in the earth_ Isa. v,20250223
I. Solomon tells us here what trial he had made of it_ and that with such advantages that_ if true satisfaction could have been found in it_ he would have found it. 1. His high station gave him an opportunity of improving himself in all parts of learning_ and particularly in politics and the conduct of human affairs_ v,20250223
I. Something that it has in common with the peacock_ that is_ beautiful feathers (v. 13): Gavest thou proud wings unto the peacocks? so some read it. Fine feathers make proud birds. The peacock is an emblem of pride; when he struts_ and shows his fine feathers_ Solomon in all his glory is not arrayed like him. The ostrich too has goodly feathers_ and yet is a foolish bird; for wisdom does not always go along with beauty and gaiety. Other birds do not envy the peacock or the ostrich their gaudy colours_ nor complain for want of them; why then should we repine if we see others wear better clothes than we can afford to wear? God gives his gifts variously_ and those gifts are not always the most valuable that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the nightingale than the tail of the peacock_ the eye of the eagle and her soaring wing_ and the natural affection of the stork_ than the beautiful wings and feathers of the ostrich_ which can never rise above the earth_ and is without natural affection?,20250223
I. That Job_ in his prosperity_ had contracted a friendship with them. If they were his equals_ yet he had not that jealousy of them—if his inferiors_ yet he had not that disdain of them_ which was any hindrance to an intimate converse and correspondence with them. to have such friends added more to his happiness in the day of his prosperity than all the head of cattle he was master of. Much of the comfort of this life lies in acquaintance and friendship with those that are prudent and virtuous; and he that has a few such friends ought to value them highly. Job's three friends are supposed to have been all of them of the posterity of Abraham_ which_ for some descents_ even in the families that were shut out from the covenant of peculiarity_ retained some good fruits of that pious education which the father of the faithful gave to those under his charge. Eliphaz descended from Teman_ the grandson of Esau (Gen. xxxvi.,20250223
I. That death is a removal for ever out of this world. This he had spoken of before (ch. vii. 9_,20250223
I. That good men are generally well-beloved by their neighbours_ but nobody cares for wicked people. 1. It is true there are some few that are enemies to the righteous_ that are prejudiced against,20250223
I. That good men were never thus ruined. For the proof of this he appeals to Job's own observation (v. 7): __Remember_ I pray thee; recollect all that thou hast seen_ heard_ or read_ and give me an instance of any one that was innocent and righteous_ and yet perished as thou dost_ and was cut off as thou art.__ If we understand it of a final and eternal destruction_ his principle is true. None that are innocent and righteous perish for ever: it is only a man of sin that is a son of perdition_,20250223
I. That he had a very great abhorrence of the sin of adultery. As he did not wrong his own marriage bed by keeping a concubine (he did not so much as think upon a maid_ v. 1)_ so he was careful not to offer any injury to his neighbour's marriage bed. Let us see here,20250223
I. That he had comfort in his God. This was the chief thing he rejoiced in_ in his prosperity_ as the spring of it and the sweetness of it_ that he had the favour of God and the tokens of that favour. He did not attribute his prosperity to a happy turn of fortune_ nor to his own might_ nor to the power of his own hand_ but makes the same acknowledgment that David does. Ps. xxx. 7_ Thou_ by thy favour_ hast made my mountain stand strong. A gracious soul delights in God's smiles_ not in the smiles of this world. Four things were then very pleasant to holy Job:—1. The confidence he had in the divine protection. They were the days when God preserved me_ v,20250223
I. That he had no insight into natural causes_ could neither see the springs of them nor foresee the effects of them (v. 15-17): Dost thou know this and know that which are the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge? We are here taught,20250223
I. That his family was scattered (v. 7): __He hath made me weary_ weary of speaking_ weary of forbearing_ weary of my friends_ weary of life itself; my journey through the world proves so very uncomfortable that I am quite tired with it.__ This made it as tiresome as any thing_ that all his company was made desolate_ his children and servants being killed and the poor remains of his great household dispersed. The company of good people that used to meet at his house for religious worship_ was now scattered_ and he spent his sabbaths in silence and solitude. He had company indeed_ but such as he would rather have been without_ for they seemed to triumph in his desolation. If lovers and friends are put far from us_ we must see and own God's hand in it_ making our company desolate.,20250223
I. That it is a sermon_ a sermon in print; the text is (ch. i.,20250223
I. That it was their folly to talk so (v. 10): __Return_ and come now_ be convinced that you are in an error_ and let me persuade you to be of my mind; for I cannot find one wise man among you_ that knows how to explain the difficulties of God's providence or how to apply the consolations of his promises.__ Those do not go wisely about the work of comforting the afflicted who fetch their comforts from the possibility of their recovery and enlargement in this world; though that is not to be despaired of_ it is at the best uncertain; and if it should fail_ as perhaps it may_ the comfort built upon it will fail too. It is therefore our wisdom to comfort ourselves_ and others_ in distress_ with that which will not fail_ the promise of God_ his love and grace_ and a well-grounded hope of eternal life.,20250223
I. That selfishness is the cause of this evil (v. 7_ 8): There is one alone_ that minds none but himself_ cares for nobody_ but would_ if he could_ be placed alone in the midst of the earth; there is not a second_ nor does he desire there should be: one mouth he thinks enough in a house_ and grudges every thing that goes beside him. See how this covetous muckworm is here described. 1. He makes himself a mere slave to his business. Though he has no charge_ neither child nor brother_ none to take care of but himself_ none to hang upon him_ or draw from him_ no poor relations_ nor dares he marry_ for fear of the expense of a family_ yet is there no end of his labour; he is at it night and day_ early and late_ and will scarcely allow necessary rest to himself and those he employs. He does not confine himself within the bounds of his own calling_ but is for having a hand in any thing that he can get by. See Ps. cxxvii,20250223
I. That the honour of virtue is really more valuable and desirable than all the wealth and pleasure in this world (v. 1): A good name is before good ointment (so it may be read); it is preferable to it_ and will be rather chosen by all that are wise. Good ointment is here put for all the profits of the earth (among the products of which oil was reckoned one of the most valuable)_ for all the delights of sense (for ointment and perfume which rejoice the heart_ and it is called the oil of gladness)_ nay_ and for the highest titles of honour with which men are dignified_ for kings are anointed. A good name is better than all riches (Prov. xxi. 1)_ that is_ a name for wisdom and goodness with those that are wise and good—the memory of the just; this is a good that will bring a more grateful pleasure to the mind_ will give a man a larger opportunity of usefulness_ and will go further_ and last longer_ than the most precious box of ointment; for Christ paid Mary for her ointment with a good name_ a name in the gospels (Matt. xxvi. and we are sure he always pays with advantage.,20250223
I. That the sin of sinners directly tends to their own ruin (v. 2): Wrath kills the foolish man_ his own wrath_ and therefore he is foolish for indulging it; it is a fire in his bones_ in his blood_ enough to put him into a fever. Envy is the rottenness of the bones_ and so slays the silly one that frets himself with it. __So it is with thee___ says Eliphaz_ __while thou quarrellest with God thou doest thyself the greatest mischief; thy anger at thy own troubles_ and thy envy at our prosperity_ do but add to thy pain and misery: turn to the saints_ and thou wilt find they understand their interest better.__ Job had told his wife she spoke as the foolish women; now Eliphaz tells him he acted as the foolish men_ the silly ones. Or it may be meant thus: __If men are ruined and undone_ it is always their own folly that ruins and undoes them. They kill themselves by some lust or other; therefore_ no doubt_ Job_ thou hast done some foolish thing_ by which thou hast brought thyself into this calamitous condition.__ Many understand it of God's wrath and jealousy. Job needed not be uneasy at the prosperity of the wicked_ for the world's smiles can never shelter them from God's frowns; they are foolish and silly if they think they will. God's anger will be the death_ the eternal death_ of those on whom it fastens. What is hell but God's anger without mixture or period?,20250223
I. That the ways of religion are plain and safe_ and in them we may enjoy a holy security. A living principle of honesty and grace will be,20250223
I. That there was no great matter to be found in it (v. 3): How hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? This is spoken ironically_ upbraiding Bildad with the good conceit he himself had of what he had said. 1. He thought he had spoken very clearly_ had declared the thing as it is. He was very fond (as we are all apt to be) of his own notions_ and thought they only were right_ and true_ and intelligible_ and all other notions of the thing were false_ mistaken_ and confused; whereas_ when we speak of the glory of God_ we cannot declare the thing as it is_ for we see it through a glass darkly_ or but by reflection_ and shall not see him as he is till we come to heaven. Here we cannot order our speech concerning him_ ch. xxxvii. 19,20250223
I. That we cannot vie with God for justice_ that the Lord is righteous and holy in his dealings with us_ but that we are unrighteous and unholy in our conduct towards him; we have a great deal to blame ourselves for_ but nothing to blame him for (v. 8): __Wilt thou disannul my judgment? Wilt thou take exceptions to what I say and do_ and bring a writ of error_ to reverse the judgment I have given as erroneous and unjust?__ Many of Job's complaints had too much of a tendency this way: I cry out of wrong_ says he_ but I am not heard; but such language as this is by no means to be suffered. God's judgment cannot_ must not_ be disannulled_ for we are sure it is according to truth_ and therefore it is a great piece of impudence and iniquity in us to call in question. __Wilt thou___ says God_ __condemn me_ that thou mayest be righteous? Must my honour suffer for the support of thy reputation? Must I be charged as dealing unjustly with thee because thou canst not otherwise clear thyself from the censures thou liest under?__ Our duty is to condemn ourselves_ that God may be righteous. David is therefore ready to own the evil he has done in God's sight_ that God may be justified when he speaks and clear when he judges_ Ps. li,20250223
I. That when God does us good it is not because he is indebted to us; if he were_ there might be some colour to say_ when he afflicts us_ __He does not deal fairly with us.__ But whoever pretends that he has by any meritorious action made God his debtor_ let him prove this debt_ and he shall be sure not to lose it_ Rom. xi,20250223
I. That when he had withdrawn from his church as his spouse_ and did not comfort her_ yet even then he had his eye upon it as his garden_ which he took care of (v. 11): __I went down into the garden of nuts_ or nutmegs_ to see the fruits of the valley_ with complacency and concern_ to see them as my own.__ When he was out of sight he was no further off than the garden_ hid among the trees of the garden_ in a low and dark valley; but then he was observing how the vine flourished_ that he might do all that to it which was necessary to promote its flourishing_ and might delight himself in it as a man does in a fruitful garden. He went to see whether the pomegranates budded. Christ observes the first beginnings of the good work of grace in the soul and the early buddings of devout affections and inclinations there_ and is well pleased with them_ as we are with the blossoms of the spring.,20250223
I. That_ though he was necessitous_ yet he was not craving_ nor burdensome to his friends. Those that are so_ whose troubles serve them to beg by_ are commonly less pitied than the silent poor. Job would be glad to see his friends_ but he did not say_ Bring unto me (v. or_ Deliver me_ v,20250223
I. The abundant reason he has to serve God with joyfulness and gladness of heart; how well God has done for him.,20250223
I. The bad words which Elihu charges upon Job_ v. 2_ 3. To evince the badness of them he appeals to Job himself_ and his own sober thoughts_ in the reflection: Thinkest thou this to be right? This intimates Elihu's confidence that the reproof he now gave was just_ for he could refer the judgment of it even to Job himself. Those that have truth and equity on their side sooner or later will have every man's conscience on their side. It also intimates his good opinion of Job_ that he thought better than he spoke_ and that_ though he had spoken amiss_ yet_ when he perceived his mistake_ he would not stand to it. When we have said_ in our haste_ that which was not right_ it becomes us to own that our second thoughts convince us that it was wrong. Two things Elihu here reproves Job for:—1. For justifying himself more than God_ which was the thing that first provoked him_ ch. xxxii,20250223
I. The books of scripture have hitherto been_ for the most part_ very plain and easy_ narratives of matter of fact_ which he that runs may read and understand_ and which are milk for babes_ such as they can receive and digest_ and both entertain and nourish themselves with. The waters of the sanctuary have hitherto been but to the ankles or to the knees_ such as a lamb might wade in_ to drink of and wash in; but here we are advanced to a higher form in God's school_ and have books put into our hands wherein are many things dark and hard to be understood_ which we do not apprehend the meaning of so suddenly and so certainly as we could wish_ the study of which requires a more close application of mind_ a greater intenseness of thought_ and the accomplishing of a diligent search_ which yet the treasure hid in them_ when it is found_ will abundantly recompense. The waters of the sanctuary are here to the loins_ and still as we go forward we shall find the waters still risen in the prophetical books_ waters to swim in (Ezek. xlvii. 3-5)_ not fordable_ nor otherwise to be passed over—depths in which an elephant will not find footing_ strong meat for strong men. The same method is observable in the New Testament_ where we find the plain history of Christ and his gospel placed first in the Evangelists and the Acts of the Apostles; then the mystery of both in the Epistles_ which are more difficult to be understood; and_ lastly_ the prophesies of things to come in the apocalyptic visions. This method_ so exactly observed in both the Testaments_ directs us in what order to proceed both in studying the things of God ourselves and in teaching them to others; we must go in the order that the scripture does; and where can we expect to find a better method of divinity and a better method of preaching?,20250223
I. The caution itself_ v. 14_ 15. 1. We must take heed of falling in with sin and sinners: Enter not into the paths of the wicked. Our teacher_ having like a faithful guide shown us the right paths,20250223
I. The characters of one that is mischievous to man and dangerous to be dealt with. If the slothful are to be condemned_ that do nothing_ much more those that do ill_ and contrive to do all the ill they can. It is a naughty person that is here spoken of_ Heb. A man of Belial; I think it should have been so translated_ because it is a term often used in scripture_ and this is the explication of it. Observe_,20250223
I. The court set_ and the prosecutor_ or accuser_ making his appearance (v. 1_ as before_ ch.,20250223
I. The deplorable condition which poor Job was now in_ which he describes_ to aggravate the great unkindness of his friends to him and to justify his own complaints. Let us see what his case was.,20250223
I. The description here given of the behemoth.,20250223
I. The destruction of the wicked foreseen and foretold_ under the similitude of darkness (v. 5_,20250223
I. The endearing names and titles by which he calls her_ to express his love to her_ to assure her of it_ and to engage and excite her love to him. Twice here he calls her My spouse (v. 8_ 11) and three times My sister_ my spouse_ v. 9_ 10_ 12. Mention was made (ch. iii. 11) of the day of his espousals_ and_ after that_ she is called his spouse_ not before. Note_ There is a marriage-covenant between Christ and his church_ between Christ and every true believer. Christ calls his church his spouse_ and his calling her so makes her so. __I have betrothed thee unto me for ever; and_ as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride_ so shall thy God rejoice over thee.__ He is not ashamed to own the relation_ but_ as becomes a kind and tender husband_ he speaks affectionately to her_ and calls her his spouse_ which cannot but strongly engage her to be faithful to him. Nay_ because no one relation among men is sufficient to set forth Christ's love to his church_ and to show that all this must be understood spiritually_ he owns her in two relations_ which among men are incompatible_ My sister_ my spouse. Abraham's saying of Sarah_ She is my sister_ was interpreted as a denying of her to be his wife; but Christ's church is to him both a sister and a spouse_ as Matt. xii. 50_ a sister and mother. His calling her sister is grounded upon his taking our nature upon him in his incarnation_ and his making us partakers of his nature in our sanctification. He clothed himself with a body (Heb. ii. and he clothes believers with his Spirit (1 Cor. vi. and so they become his sisters. They are children of God his Father (2 Cor. vi. 18) and so they become his sisters; he that sanctifies_ and those that are sanctified_ are all of one (Heb. ii. 11); and he owns them_ and loves them_ as his sisters.,20250223
I. The exhortation is_ to have religion's rules always in view and always at heart_ v,20250223
I. The form of his oath (v. 2): As God liveth_ who hath taken away my judgment. Here,20250223
I. The good counsel which Eliphaz gives to Job; and good counsel it is to us all_ though_ as to Job_ it was built upon a false supposition that he was a wicked man and now a stranger and enemy to God. 1. Acquaint now thyself with God. Acquiesce in God; so some. It is our duty at all times_ especially when we are in affliction_ to accommodate ourselves to_ and quiet ourselves in_ all the disposals of the divine Providence. Join thyself to him (so some); fall in with his interests_ and act no longer in opposition to him. Our translators render it well_ __Acquaint thyself with him; be not such a stranger to him as thou hast made thyself by casting off the fear of him and restraining prayer before him.__ It is the duty and interest of every one of us to acquaint himself with God. We must get the knowledge of him_ fix our affections on him_ join ourselves to him in a covenant of friendship_ and then set up_ and keep up_ a constant correspondence with him in the ways he has appointed. It is our honour that we are made capable of this acquaintance_ our misery that by sin we have lost it_ our privilege that through Christ we are invited to return to it; and it will be our unspeakable happiness to contract and cultivate this acquaintance,20250223
I. The indisposition that the spouse was under_ and the listlessness that had seized her (v. 2): I sleep_ but my heart wakes. Here is,20250223
I. The invitation which Solomon gives to his children to come and receive instruction from him (v. 1_ 2): Hear_ you children_ the instruction of a father. That is,20250223
I. The knowledge of God's secret will_ the will of his providence_ is out of our reach_ and what God has reserved to himself. It belongs to the Lord our God. To know the particulars of what God will do hereafter_ and the reasons of what he is doing now_ is the knowledge Job first speaks of.,20250223
I. The manner in which this message was sent to Eliphaz_ and the circumstances of the conveyance of it to him. 1. It was brought to him secretly_ or by stealth. Some of the sweetest communion gracious souls have with God is in secret_ where no eye sees but that of him who is all eye. God has ways of bringing conviction_ counsel_ and comfort_ to his people_ unobserved by the world_ by private whispers_ as powerfully and effectually as by the public ministry. His secret is with them_ Ps. xxv,20250223
I. The meanness of the persons that affronted him. As it added much to his honour_ in the day of his prosperity_ that princes and nobles showed him respect and paid a deference to him_ so it added no less to his disgrace in his adversity that he was spurned by the footmen_ and trampled upon by those that were not only every way his inferiors_ but were the meanest and most contemptible of all mankind. None can be represented as more base than those are here represented who insulted Job_ upon all accounts. 1. They were young_ younger than he (v. 1)_ the youth (v. who ought to have behaved themselves respectfully towards him for his age and gravity. Even the children_ in their play_ played upon him_ as the children of Bethel upon the prophet_ Go up_ thou bald-head. Children soon learn to be scornful when they see their parents so,20250223
I. The patient described in his extremity. See what work sickness makes (v. 19_ &c.) when God sends it with commission. Do this_ and doeth it. 1. The sick man is full of pain all over him,20250223
I. The praises of wisdom. Many things are here said in its commendation_ to engage us to get and retain wisdom. 1. Wisdom is necessary to the right managing and improving of our worldly possessions: Wisdom is good with an inheritance_ that is_ an inheritance is good for little without wisdom. Though a man have a great estate_ though it come easily to him_ by descent from his ancestors_ if he have not wisdom to use it for the end for which he has it_ he had better have been without it. Wisdom is not only good for the poor_ to make them content and easy_ but it is good for the rich too_ good with riches to keep a man from getting hurt by them_ and to enable a man to do good with them. Wisdom is good of itself_ and makes a man useful; but_ if he have a good estate with it_ that will put him into a greater capacity of being useful_ and with his wealth he may be more serviceable to his generation than he could have been without it; he will also make friends to himself_ Luke xvi,20250223
I. The preface to his prayer: Two things have I required (that is_ requested) of thee_ O God!,20250223
I. The price of it_ for that is inestimable; its worth is infinitely more than all the riches in this world: Man knows not the price thereof (v. that is,20250223
I. The proper season and opportunity for these admonitions (v. 15): In a dream_ in slumberings upon the bed_ when men are retired from the world and the business and conversation of it. It is a good time for them to retire into their own hearts_ and commune with them_ when they are upon their beds_ solitary and still_ Ps. iv,20250223
I. The reason why his three friends were now silent. They ceased to answer him_ and let him have his saying_ because he was righteous in his own eyes. This was the reason they gave why they said no more_ because it was to no purpose to argue with a man that was so opinionative_ v. 1. Those that are self-conceited are indeed hard to be wrought upon; there is more hope of a fool (a fool of God's making) than of those who are fools of their own making_ Prov. xxvi,20250223
I. The rich provision which Wisdom has made for the reception of all those that will be her disciples. This is represented under the similitude of a sumptuous feast_ whence it is probable_ our Saviour borrowed those parables in which he compared the kingdom of heaven to a great supper_ Matt. xxii. 2; Luke xiv,20250223
I. The safety of his bed (v. 7): Behold his bed_ even Solomon's_ very rich and fine; for such the curtains of Solomon were. His bed_ which is above Solomon's_ so some read it. Christ's bed_ though he had not where to lay his head_ is better than Solomon's best bed. The church is his bed_ for he has said of it. This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell. The hearts of believers are his bed_ for he lies all night between their breasts_ Eph. iii,20250223
I. The seasonable word of caution and exhortation that he gives him (v. 17): __Despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty. Call it a chastening_ which comes from the father's love and is designed for the child's good. Call it the chastening of the Almighty_ with whom it is madness to contend_ to whom it is wisdom and duty to submit_ and who will be a God all-sufficient (for so the word signifies) to all those that trust in him. Do not despise it;__ it is a copious word in the original.,20250223
I. The sin itself_ and that is robbing the poor and making them poorer_ taking from those that have but little to lose and so leaving them nothing. It is bad to rob any man_ but most absurd to rob the poor_ whom we should relieve_—to squeeze those with our power whom we should water with our bounty_—to oppress the afflicted_ and so to add affliction to them_—to give judgment against them_ and so to patronise those that do rob them_ which is as bad as if we robbed them ourselves. Rich men will not suffer themselves to be wronged; poor men cannot help themselves_ and therefore we ought to be the more careful not to wrong them.,20250223
I. The summary of religion. Setting aside all matters of doubtful disputation_ to be religious is to fear God and keep his commandments. 1. The root of religion is fear of God reigning in the heart_ and a reverence of his majesty_ a deference to his authority_ and a dread of his wrath. Fear God_ that is_ worship God_ give him the honour due to his name_ in all the instances of true devotion_ inward and outward. See Rev. xiv. 7,20250223
I. The testimony which Job's conscience gave in concerning his constant behaviour towards the poor. He enlarges most upon this head because in this matter he was most particularly accused. He solemnly protests_,20250223
I. The things revealed are easy to be known_ for they belong to us and to our children (Deut. xxix. and we need not soar up to heaven_ or dive into the depths_ to get the knowledge of them (Deut. xxx. for they are published and proclaimed in some measure by the works of the creation (Ps. xix. 1)_ more fully by the consciences of men and the eternal reasons and rules of good and evil_ but most clearly by Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. The precepts of wisdom may easily be known; for,20250223
I. The troubles of their condition (v. 1); of these he speaks very feelingly and with compassion. It grieved him,20250223
I. The wealth of this world is hidden in the earth. Thence the silver and the gold_ which afterwards they refine_ are fetched_ v. 1. There they lay mixed with a great deal of dirt and dross_ like a worthless thing_ of no more account than common earth; and abundance of them will so lie neglected_ till the earth and all the works therein shall be burnt up. Holy Mr. Herbert_ in his poem called Avarice_ takes notice of this_ to shame men out of the love of money:—,20250223
I. The wild goats and the hinds. That which is taken notice of concerning them is the bringing forth and bringing up of their young ones. For_ as every individual is fed_ so every species of animals is preserved_ by the care of the divine Providence_ and_ for aught we know_ none extinct to this day. Observe here,20250223
I. Their ruin will take its rise from God's wrath and vengeance_ v,20250223
I. They are here consulting about their sister_ their little sister_ and the disposing of her.,20250223
I. This was bad enough. The extremity of his trouble and the discomposure of his spirits may excuse it in part_ but he can by no means be justified in it. Now he has forgotten the good he was born to_ the lean kine have eaten up the fat ones_ and he is filled with thoughts of the evil only_ and wishes he had never been born. The prophet Jeremiah himself expressed his painful sense of his calamities in language not much unlike this: Woe is me_ my mother_ that thou hast borne me! Jer.,20250223
I. To abase himself. Before he makes confession of his faith he makes confession of his folly and the weakness and deficiency of reason_ which make it so necessary that we be guided and governed by faith. Before he speaks concerning the Saviour he speaks of himself as needing a Saviour_ and as nothing without him; we must go out of ourselves before we go into Jesus Christ.,20250223
I. To be conscientious in paying our vows.,20250223
I. To convince Job of his own weakness he is here challenged to subdue and tame this leviathan if he can_ and make himself master of him (ver. 1-9)_ and_ since he cannot do this_ he must own himself utterly unable to stand before the great God_ ver. 10.,20250223
I. To men's worldly estate. The world is a great cheat_ not only the things of the world_ but the men of the world. All men are liars. Here is an instance in two sore evils under the sun:—1. Some that are really poor would be thought to be rich and are thought to be so; they trade and spend as if they were rich_ make a great bustle and a great show as if they had hidden treasures_ when perhaps_ if all their debts were paid_ they are not worth a groat. This is sin_ and will be shame; many a one hereby ruins his family and brings reproach upon his profession of religion. Those that thus live above what they have choose to be subject to their own pride rather than to God's providence_ and it will end accordingly,20250223
I. To the bridegroom_ not giving him any name or title_ but beginning abruptly: Let him kiss me; like Mary Magdalen to the supposed gardener (John xx.,20250223
I. To what intent Job makes this confession of his faith here. Never did any thing come in more pertinently_ or to better purpose. 1. Job was now accused_ and this was his appeal. His friends reproached him as a hypocrite and contemned him as a wicked man; but he appeals to his creed_ to his faith_ to his hope_ and to his own conscience_ which not only acquitted him from reigning sin_ but comforted him with the expectation of a blessed resurrection. These are not the words of him that has a devil. He appeals to the coming of the Redeemer_ from this wrangle at the bar to the judgment of the bench_ even to him to whom all judgment is committed_ who he knew would right him. The consideration of God's day coming will make it a very small thing with us to be judged of man's judgment_ 1 Cor. iv. 3_ 4. How easily may we bear the unjust calumnies and reproaches of men while we expect the glorious appearance of our Redeemer_ and his redeemed_ at the last day_ and that there will then be a resurrection of names_ as well as bodies! 2. Job was now afflicted_ and this was his cordial; when he was pressed above measure this kept him from fainting—he believed that he should see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living; not in this world_ for that is the land of the dying.,20250223
I. Two things we must be graciously dead to:—1. To the pleasures of sense_ for it is not good to eat much honey; though it pleases the taste_ and_ if eaten with moderation_ is very wholesome_ yet_ if eaten to excess_ it becomes nauseous_ creates bile_ and is the occasion of many diseases. It is true of all the delights of the children of men that they will surfeit_ but never satisfy_ and they are dangerous to those that allow themselves the liberal use of them,20250223
I. Tyrants_ and those that do wrong under pretence of law and authority. It is a melancholy sight which has often been seen under the sun_ wickedness in the place of judgment (Eccl. iii. the unregarded tears of the oppressed_ while on the side of the oppressors there was power (Eccl.,20250223
I. We are often disappointed of the good we had great hopes of_ v,20250223
I. We are sure that it is given by inspiration of God_ though we are not certain who was the penman of it. The Jews_ though no friends to Job_ because he was a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel_ yet_ as faithful conservators of the oracles of God committed to them_ always retained this book in their sacred canon. The history is referred to by one apostle (James v. 11) and one passage (ch. v. 13) is quoted by another apostle_ with the usual form of quoting scripture_ It is written_ 1 Cor. iii,20250223
I. We must have a continual regard to God's precepts_ v. 1_ 2.,20250223
I. We must have a continual regard to the word of God and endeavour that it may be always ready to us.,20250223
I. We must live in a humble and dutiful subjection to God and his government (v. 7): __Fear the Lord_ as your sovereign Lord and Master; be ruled in every thing by your religion and subject to the divine will.__ This must be,20250223
I. We must make the best of that which is_ and must believe it best for the present_ and accommodate ourselves to it: He has made every thing beautiful in his time (v. and therefore_ while its time lasts_ we must be reconciled to it: nay_ we must please ourselves with the beauty of it. Note,20250223
I. We must render to all their due_ both in justice and charity_ and not delay to do it (v. 27_ 28): __Withhold not good from those to whom it is due (either for want of love to them or through too much love to thy money) when it is in the power of thy hand to do it_ for_ if it be not_ it cannot be expected; but it was thy great fault if thou didst_ by thy extravagances_ disable thyself to do justly and show mercy_ and it ought to be the greatest of thy griefs if God had disabled thee_ not so much that thou art straitened in thy own comforts and conveniences as that thou hast not wherewithal to give to those to whom it is due.__ Withhold it not; this implies that it is called for and expected_ but that the hand is drawn in and the bowels of compassion are shut up. We must not hinder others from doing it_ not be ourselves backward to it. __If thou hast it by thee to-day_ hast it in the power of thy hand_ say not to thy neighbour_ Go thy way for this time_ and come at a more convenient season_ and I will then see what will be done; to-morrow I will give; whereas thou art not sure that thou shalt live till to-morrow_ or that to-morrow thou shalt have it by thee. Be not thus loth to part with thy money upon a good account. Make not excuses to shift off a duty that must be done_ nor delight to keep thy neighbour in pain and in suspense_ nor to show the authority which the giver has over the beggar; but readily and cheerfully_ and from a principle of conscience towards God_ give good to those to whom it is due___ to the lords and owners of it (so the word is)_ to those who upon any account are entitled to it. This requires us,20250223
I. What a profound respect was paid to him by all sorts of people_ not only for the dignity of his place_ but for his personal merit_ his eminent prudence_ integrity_ and good management. 1. The people honoured him and stood in awe of him_ v,20250223
I. What great need wise men have to take heed of being guilty of any instance of folly; for a little folly is a great blemish to him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour_ and is as hurtful to his good name as dead flies are to a sweet perfume_ not only spoiling the sweetness of it_ but making it to send forth a stinking savour. Note,20250223
I. What his wickedness is for which he is punished.,20250223
I. What it is to find wisdom so as to be made happy by it.,20250223
I. What it was that Job complained of; it was this_ That God did not regard the cries of the oppressed against their oppressors (v. 9): __By reason of the multitude of oppressions_ the many hardships which proud tyrants put upon poor people and the barbarous usage they give them_ they make the oppressed to cry; but it is to no purpose: God does not appear to right them. They cry out_ they cry on still_ by reason of the arm of the mighty_ which lies heavily upon them.__ This seems to refer to those words of Job (ch. xxiv.,20250223
I. What means we must use that we may obtain wisdom.,20250223
I. What the business was which he made trial of; it was business under the sun (v. 17-20)_ about the things of this world_ sublunary things_ the riches_ honours_ and pleasures of this present time; it was the business of a king. There is business above the sun_ perpetual business_ which is perpetual blessedness; what we do in conformity to that business (doing God's will as it is done in heaven) and in pursuance of that blessedness_ will turn to a good account; we shall have no reason to hate that labour_ nor to despair of it. But it is labour under the sun_ labour for the meat that perishes (John vi. 27; Isa. lv. that Solomon here speaks of with so little satisfaction. It was the better sort of business_ not that of the hewers of wood and drawers of water (it is not so strange if men hate all that labour)_ but it was in wisdom_ and knowledge_ and equity_ v,20250223
I. Who is the tempter—a foolish woman_ Folly herself_ in opposition to Wisdom. Carnal sensual pleasure I take to be especially meant by this foolish woman (v. 13); for that is the great enemy to virtue and inlet to vice; that defiles and debauches the mind_ stupefies conscience_ and puts out the sparks of conviction_ more than any thing else. This tempter is here described to be,20250223
I. Who wrote these wise sayings_ v. 1. They are the proverbs of Solomon. 1. His name signifies peaceable_ and the character both of his spirit and of his reign answered to it; both were peaceable. David_ whose life was full of troubles_ wrote a book of devotion; for is any afflicted? let him pray. Solomon_ who lived quietly_ wrote a book of instruction; for when the churches had rest they were edified. In times of peace we should learn ourselves_ and teach others_ that which in troublous times both they and we must practise,20250223
IV. A challenge given to make a further trial of Job's integrity (v. 5): __Put forth thy hand now (for I find my hand too short to reach him_ and too weak to hurt him) and touch his bone and his flesh (that is with him the only tender part_ make him sick with smiting him_ Mic. vi. and then_ I dare say_ he will curse thee to thy face_ and let go his integrity.__ Satan knew it_ and we find it by experience_ that nothing is more likely to ruffle the thoughts and put the mind into disorder than acute pain and distemper of body. There is no disputing against sense. St. Paul himself had much ado to bear a thorn in the flesh_ nor could he have borne it without special grace from Christ_ 2 Cor.,20250223
IV. An effectual antidote against the temptation_ in a few words_ v,20250223
IV. Even a poor man_ who has business_ and is discreet_ diligent_ and dexterous_ in the management of it_ may get as comfortably through this world as he that is loaded with an overgrown estate. Consider what the poor has less than the rich_ if he but knows to walk before the living_ knows how to conduct himself decently_ and do his duty to all_ how to get an honest livelihood by his labour_ how to spend his time well and improve his opportunities. What has he? Why_ he is better beloved and more respected among his neighbours_ and has a better interest than many a rich man that is griping and haughty. What has he? Why he has as much of the comfort of this life_ has food and raiment_ and is therewith content_ and so is as truly rich as he that has abundance.,20250223
IV. God has the clouds under his cognizance and government_ but so have not we_ v,20250223
IV. He begs they would be silent and give him a patient hearing_ v. 5_ 6. 1. He thinks it would be a credit to them if they would say no more_ having said too much already: __Hold your peace_ and it shall be your wisdom_ for thereby you will conceal your ignorance and ill-nature_ which now appear in all you say.__ They pleaded that they could not forbear speaking (ch. iv. 2_ xi. 2_ 3); but he tells them that they would better have consulted their own reputation if they had enjoined themselves silence. Better say nothing than nothing to the purpose or that which tends to the dishonour of God and the grief of our brethren. Even a fool_ when he holds his peace_ is accounted wise_ because nothing appears to the contrary_ Prov. xvii,20250223
IV. He challenges death to do its worst. If he could not die without the dreadful prefaces of bitter pains and agonies_ and strong convulsions_ if he must be racked before he be executed_ yet_ in prospect of dying at last_ he would make nothing of dying pangs: __I would harden myself in sorrow_ would open my breast to receive death's darts_ and not shrink from them. Let him not spare; I desire no mitigation of that pain which will put a happy period to all my pains. Rather than not die_ let me die so as to feel myself die.__ These are passionate words_ which might better have been spared. We should soften ourselves in sorrow_ that we may receive the good impressions of it_ and by the sadness of the countenance our hearts_ being made tender_ may be made better; but_ if we harden ourselves_ we provoke God to proceed in his controversy; for when he judgeth he will overcome. It is great presumption to dare the Almighty_ and to say_ Let him not spare; for are we stronger than he? 1 Cor. x,20250223
IV. He charges him with a contempt of the counsels and comforts that were given him by his friends (v. 11): Are the consolations of God small with thee? 1. Eliphaz takes it ill that Job did not value the comforts which he and his friends administered to him more than it seems he did_ and did not welcome every word they said as true and important. It is true they had said some very good things_ but_ in their application to Job_ they were miserable comforters. Note_ We are apt to think that great and considerable which we ourselves say_ when others perhaps with good reason think it small and trifling. Paul found that those who seemed to be somewhat_ yet_ in conference_ added nothing to him_ Gal. ii. 6,20250223
IV. He comforts himself in God_ and still keeps hold of his confidence in him. Observe here,20250223
IV. He concludes with a bold challenge to all that were present to disprove what he had said if they could (v. 25): __If it be not so now_ as I have declared_ and if it do not thence follow that I am unjustly condemned and censured_ let those that can undertake to prove that my discourse is either,20250223
IV. He encourages him thus to seek to God_ and commit his cause to him. It will not be in vain to do so_ for he is one in whom we shall find effectual help.,20250223
IV. He had a prospect of death which would put a period to all his troubles. Such confidence had he towards God that he could take pleasure in thinking of the approach of death_ when he should be determined to his everlasting state_ as one that doubted not but it would be well with him then: When a few years have come (the years of number which are determined and appointed to me) then I shall go the way whence I shall not return. Note,20250223
IV. He owns this to be a very great grievance to those that are wise and good: __This is an evil_ the greatest perplexity_ among all things that are done under the sun (v. 3); nothing has given me more disturbance than this_ that there is one event unto all.__ It hardens atheists_ and strengthens the hands of evil-doers; for therefore it is that the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil and fully set in them to do evil_ ch. viii,20250223
IV. He prefers her before all competitors_ and sees all the beauties and perfections of others meeting and centering in her (v. 8_ 9): __There are_ it may be_ threescore queens_ who_ like Esther_ have by their beauty attained to the royal state and dignity_ and fourscore concubines_ whom kings have preferred before their own queens_ as more charming_ and these attended by their maids of honour_ virgins without number_ who_ when there is a ball at court_ appear in great splendour_ with beauty that dazzles the eyes of the spectators; but my dove_ my undefiled_ is but one_ a holy one.__,20250223
IV. He protests that he had never been unkind or inhospitable to strangers (v. 32): The stranger lodged not in the street_ as angels might lately have done in the streets of Sodom if Lot alone had not entertained them. Perhaps by that instance Job was taught (as we are_ Heb. xiii. 2) not to be forgetful to entertain strangers. He that is at home must consider those that are from home_ and put his soul into their soul's stead_ and then do as he would be done by. Hospitality is a Christian duty_ 1 Pet. iv,20250223
IV. He puts himself into the posture of a penitent_ and therein goes upon a right principle. In true repentance there must be not only conviction of sin_ but contrition and godly sorrow for it_ sorrow according to God_ 2 Cor. vii,20250223
IV. He sadly complains of God's severe dealings with him. He owns it was for his sins that God thus contended with him_ but thinks it hard_,20250223
IV. He takes a particular care for the protection of his good subjects_ v,20250223
IV. He would not have us undertake to give a reason for that which God does_ for his way is in the sea and his path in the great waters_ past finding out_ and therefore we must be contentedly and piously ignorant of the meaning of God's proceedings in the government of the world_ v. 16_,20250223
IV. His family was built up again_ and he had great comfort in his children_ v. 13-15. The last of his afflictions that are recorded (ch. i.)_ and the most grievous_ was the death of all his children at once. His friends upbraided him with it (ch. viii. but God repaired even that breach in process of time_ either by the same wife_ or_ she being dead_ by another. 1. The number of his children was the same as before_ seven sons and three daughters. Some give this reason why they were not doubled as his cattle were_ because his children that were dead were not lost_ but gone before to a better world; and therefore_ if he have but the same number of them_ they may be reckoned doubled_ for he has two fleeces of children (as I may say) mahanaim—two hosts_ one in heaven_ the other on earth_ and in both he is rich,20250223
IV. His gracious purpose to add to her ornaments; for where God has given true grace he will give more grace; to him that has shall be given. Is the church courageous in her resistance of sin_ as the horses in Pharaoh's chariots? Is she comely in the exercise of grace_ as with rows of jewels and chains of gold? She shall be yet further beautified (v. 11): We will make thee borders of gold_ inlaid_ or enamelled_ with studs of silver. Whatever is wanting shall be made up_ till the church and every true believer come to be perfect in beauty; see Ezek. xvi,20250223
IV. How cautious subjects have need to be that they harbour not any disloyal purposes in their minds_ nor keep up any factious cabals or consultations against the government_ because it is ten to one that they are discovered and brought to light_ v,20250223
IV. How she found him at last_ v,20250223
IV. In the clouds_ the womb where all these watery meteors are conceived_ of which he had spoken_ ch. xxxvi,20250223
IV. It will make all those happy_ truly happy_ that receive and embrace it.,20250223
IV. Of the breadth of the earth (v. 18): Hast thou perceived that? The knowledge of this might seem most level to him and within his reach; yet he is challenged to declare this if he can. We have our residence on the earth_ God has given it to the children of men. But who ever surveyed it_ or could give an account of the number of its acres? It is but a point to the universe? yet_ small as it is_ we cannot be exact in declaring the dimensions of it. Job had never sailed round the world_ nor any before him; so little did men know the breadth of the earth that it was but a few ages ago that the vast continent of America was discovered_ which had_ time out of mind_ lain hidden. The divine perfection is longer than the earth and broader than the sea; it is therefore presumption for us_ who perceive not the breadth of the earth_ to dive into the depth of God's counsels.,20250223
IV. Of the calamitous state of human life. Man_ as he is short-lived_ so he is sad-lived. Though he had but a few days to spend here_ yet_ if he might rejoice in those few_ it were well (a short life and a merry one is the boast of some); but it is not so. During these few days he is full of trouble_ not only troubled_ but full of trouble_ either toiling or fretting_ grieving or fearing. No day passes without some vexation_ some hurry_ some disorder or other. Those that are fond of the world shall have enough of it. He is satur tremore—full of commotion. The fewness of his days creates him a continual trouble and uneasiness in expectation of the period of them_ and he always hangs in doubt of his life. Yet_ since man's days are so full of trouble_ it is well that they are few_ that the soul's imprisonment in the body_ and banishment from the Lord_ are not perpetual_ are not long. When we come to heaven our days will be many_ and perfectly free from trouble_ and in the mean time faith_ hope_ and love_ balance the present grievances.,20250223
IV. Of the success of the temptation. Promising the young man every thing that was pleasant_ and impunity in the enjoyment_ she gained her point_ v,20250223
IV. See his memory buried with him_ or made odious; he shall either be forgotten or spoken of with dishonour (v. 17): His remembrance shall perish from the earth; and_ if it perish thence_ it perishes wholly_ for it was never written in heaven_ as the names of the saints are_ Luke x,20250223
IV. She professes her strong affection and most passionate love to Jesus Christ (v. 5): I am sick of love_ overcome_ overpowered_ by it. David explains this when he says (Ps. cxix.,20250223
IV. She promises to her beloved the best entertainment she can give him at her country seat; for he will come in to us_ and sup with us_ Rev. iii,20250223
IV. Some particular cautions against those sins which are_ of all sins_ the most destructive to the seeds of wisdom and grace in the soul_ which impoverish and ruin it. 1. Gluttony and drunkenness_ v. 20_ 21. The world is full of examples of this sin and temptations to it_ which all young people are concerned to stand upon their guard against and keep at a distance from Be not a wine-bibber; we are allowed to drink a little wine (1 Tim. v. but not much_ not to make a trade of it_ never to drink to excess. Be not a riotous eater of flesh_ as the Israelites were_ who lusted exceedingly after it_ saying_ Who will give us flesh to eat? Whereas Paul_ though he is free to eat flesh_ yet resolves that he will eat no flesh while the world stands rather than make his brother to offend; so indifferent is he to it_ 1 Cor. viii,20250223
IV. Sometimes it is a ruin that comes upon him insensibly_ v,20250223
IV. That all about him were abusive to him_ v,20250223
IV. That gravity and seriousness better become us_ and are better for us_ than mirth and jollity_,20250223
IV. That we cannot vie with God for dominion over the proud_ v. 11-14. here the cause is put upon this short issue: if Job can humble and abase proud tyrants and oppressors as easily and effectually as God can_ it shall be acknowledged that he has some colour to compete with God. Observe here_,20250223
IV. That_ though he had let fall some passionate expressions_ yet in the main he was in the right_ and that his afflictions_ though very extraordinary_ did not prove him to be a hypocrite or a wicked man. His righteousness he holds fast_ and will not let it go. For the evincing of it he here appeals,20250223
IV. The application of this to his friends. His creed spoke comfort to himself_ but warning and terror to those that set themselves against him.,20250223
IV. The best use which is therefore to be made of the wealth of this world_ and that is to use it cheerfully_ to take the comfort of it_ and do good with it. With this he concludes the chapter_ v. 24-26. There is no true happiness to be found in these things. They are vanity_ and_ if happiness be expected from them_ the disappointment will be vexation of spirit. But he will put us in a way to make the best of them_ and to avoid the inconveniences he had observed. We must neither over-toil ourselves_ so as_ in pursuit of more_ to rob ourselves of the comfort of what we have_ nor must we over-hoard for hereafter_ nor lose our own enjoyment of what we have to lay it up for those that shall come after us_ but serve ourselves out of it first. Observe_,20250223
IV. The church's hope and expectation of Christ's coming_ and her prayer grounded thereupon.,20250223
IV. The comment which Eliphaz makes upon this_ for so it seems to be; yet some take all the following verses to be spoken in vision. It comes all to one.,20250223
IV. The infinite complacency which the Father had in him_ and he in the Father (v. 30): I was by him_ as one brought up with him. As by an eternal generation he was brought forth of the Father_ so by an eternal counsel he was brought up with him_ which intimates_ not only the infinite love of the Father to the Son_ who is therefore called the Son of his love (Col. i. but the mutual consciousness and good understanding that were between them concerning the work of man's redemption_ which the Son was to undertake_ and about which the counsel of peace was between them both_ Zech. vi,20250223
IV. The instructions she gives to those that are invited_ which her maidens must inculcate upon them.,20250223
IV. The powerful influences of divine grace_ by which she was made willing to rise and open to her beloved. When he could not prevail with her by persuasion he put in his hand by the hole in the door_ to unbolt it_ as one weary of waiting_ v,20250223
IV. The question God puts to him concerning Job (v. 8): Hast thou considered my servant Job? As when we meet with one that has been in a distant place_ where we have a friend we dearly love_ we are ready to ask_ __You have been in such a place; pray did you see my friend there?__ Observe_,20250223
IV. The recovery of the sick man hereupon. Take away the cause and the effect will cease. When the patient becomes a penitent see what a blessed change follows. 1. His body recovers its health_ v,20250223
IV. The style and composition of these books are different from those that go before and those that follow. Our Saviour divides the books of the Old Testament into the Law_ the Prophets_ and the Psalms (Luke xxiv. and thereby teaches us to distinguish those books that are poetical_ or metrical_ from the Law and the Prophets; and such are all these that are now before us_ except Ecclesiastes_ which yet_ having something restrained in its style_ may well enough be reckoned among them. They are books in verse_ according to the ancient rules of versifying_ though not according to the Greek and Latin prosodies. Some of the ancients call these five books the second Pentateuch of the Old Testament_4 five sacred volumes which are as the satellites to the five books of the law of Moses. Gregory Nazianzen5 (carm. 33_ p. 98) calls these hai sticherai pente—the five metrical books; first Job (so he reckons them up)_ then David_ then the three of Solomon-Ecclesiastes_ the Song_ and Proverbs. Amphilochius_ bishop at Iconium_ in his iambic poem to Seleucus_ reckons them up particularly_ and calls them sticheras pente Biblos—the five verse-books. Epiphanius (lib. de ponder. et mensur. p. 533) pente stichereis—the five verse-books. And Cyril. Hierosol. Collect. 4_ p. 30 (mihi—in my copy)_ calls these five books ta stichera—books in verse. Polychronius_ in his prologue to Job_ says that as those that are without call their tragedies and comedies poietika—poetics_ so_ in sacred writ_ those books which are composed in Hebrew metre (of which he reckons Job the first) we call stichera biblia—books in verse_ written kata stichon—according to order. What is written in metre_ or rhythm_ is so called from metros—a measure_ and arithmos—a number_ because regulated by certain measures_ or numbers of syllables_ which please the ear with their smoothness and cadency_ and so insinuate the matter the more movingly and powerfully into the fancy. Sir William Temple_6 in his essay upon poetry_ thinks it is generally agreed to have been the first sort of writing that was used in the world_ nay_ that_ in several nations_ poetical compositions preceded the very invention or usage of letters. The Spaniards (he says) found in America many strains of poetry_ and such as seemed to flow from a true poetic vein_ before any letters were known in those regions. The same (says he) is probable of the Scythians and Grecians: the oracles of Apollo were delivered in verse. Homer and Hesiod wrote their poems (the very Alcoran of the pagan dæmonology) many ages before the appearing of any of the Greek philosophers or historians; and long before them (if we may give credit to the antiquities of Greece)_ even before the days of David_ Orpheus and Linus were celebrated poets and musicians in Greece; and at the same time Carmenta_ the mother of Evander_ who was the first that introduced letters among the natives of Greece_ was so called à carmine—from a song_ because she expressed herself in verse. And in such veneration was this way of writing among the ancients that their poets were called vates—prophets_ and their muses were deified. But_ which is more certain and considerable_ the most ancient composition that we meet with in scripture was the song of Moses at the Red Sea (Exod. xv.)_ which we find before the very first mention of writing_ for that occurs not until Exod. xvii. 14_ when God bade Moses write a memorial of the war with Amalek. The first_ and indeed the true and general end of writing_ is a help of memory; and poetry does in some measure answer that end_ and even in the want of writing_ much more with writing_ helps to preserve the remembrance of ancient things. The book of the wars of the Lord (Num. xxi. and the book of Jasher (Josh. x. 13 Sam. i. seem to have been both written in poetic measures. Many sacred songs we meet with in the Old Testament_ scattered both in the historical and prophetical books_ penned on particular occasions_ which_ in the opinion of very competent judges_ __have in them as true and noble strains of poetry and picture as are met with in any other language whatsoever_ in spite of all disadvantages from translations into such different tongues and common prose_7 nay_ are nobler examples of the true sublime style of poetry than any that can be found in the Pagan writers; the images are so strong_ the thoughts so great_ the expressions so divine_ and the figures so admirably bold and moving_ that the wonderful manner of these writers is quite inimitable.__8 It is fit that what is employed in the service of the sanctuary should be the best in its kind.,20250223
IV. Those words—(v.,20250223
IV. Thus_ in a good measure_ Job still held fast his integrity_ and Satan's design against him was defeated: In all this did not Job sin with his lips; he not only said this well_ but all he said at this time was under the government of religion and right reason. In the midst of all these grievances he did not speak a word amiss; and we have no reason to think but that he also preserved a good temper of mind_ so that_ though there might be some stirrings and risings of corruption in his heart_ yet grace got the upper hand and he took care that the root of bitterness might not spring up to trouble him_ Heb. xii,20250223
IV. Upon all these accounts he recommends himself to the compassion of his friends_ and justly blames their harshness with him. From this representation of his deplorable case_ it was easy to infer,20250223
IV. We are sure that it is of great use to the church_ and to every good Christian_ though there are many passages in it dark and hard to be understood. We cannot perhaps be confident of the true meaning of every Arabic word and phrase we meet with in it. It is a book that finds a great deal of work for the critics; but enough is plain to make the whole profitable_ and it was all written for our learning.,20250223
IV. We must be entirely satisfied in all the disposals of the divine Providence_ both as to personal and public concerns_ and bring our minds to them_ because God_ in all_ performs the thing that is appointed for us_ acts according to the counsel of his will; and we are here told,20250223
IV. We must make a covenant with our eyes: __Let them look right on and straight before thee_,20250223
IV. We must not envy the prosperity of evil-doers_ v,20250223
IV. What good use may be made of them_ v. 5_ 6. Those who are young and simple may by them be made wise_ and are not excluded from Solomon's school_ as they were from Plato's. But is it only for such? No; here is not only milk for babes_ but strong meat for strong men. This book will not only make the foolish and bad wise and good_ but the wise and good wiser and better; and though the simple and the young man may perhaps slight those instructions_ and not be the better for them_ yet the wise man will hear. Wisdom will be justified by her own children_ though not by the children sitting in the market-place. Note_ Even wise men must hear_ and not think themselves too wise to learn. A wise man is sensible of his own defects (Plurima ignoro_ sed ignorantiam meam non ignoro—I am ignorant of many things_ but not of my own ignorance)_ and therefore is still pressing forward_ that he may increase in learning_ may know more and know it better_ more clearly and distinctly_ and may know better how to make use of it. As long as we live we should strive to increase in all useful learning. It was a saying of one of the greatest of the rabbin_ Qui non auget scientiam_ amittit de ea—If our stock of knowledge by not increasing_ it is wasting; and those that would increase in learning must study the scriptures; these perfect the man of God. A wise man_ by increasing in learning_ is not only profitable to himself_ but to others also,20250223
IV. With outrageous passion: He teareth himself in his anger_ v,20250223
IV. With that to keep down the fear of man_ v,20250223
IX. Satan's departure from this meeting of the sons of God. Before they broke up_ Satan went forth (as Cain_ Gen. iv. 16) from the presence of the Lord; no longer detained before him (as Doeg was_ 1 Sam. xxi. 7) than till he had accomplished his malicious purpose. He went forth,20250223
Idleness is no better. He that is remiss in his work_ whose hands hang down (so the word signifies)_ that stands_ as we may_ with his thumbs in his mouth_ that neglects his business_ does it not at all_ or as if he did it not_ he is own brother to him that is a prodigal_ that is_ he is as much a fool and in as sure and ready a way to poverty; one scatters what he has_ the other lets it run through his fingers. The observation is too true in the affairs of religion; he that is trifling and careless in praying and hearing is brother to him that does not pray or hear at all; and omissions of duty and in duty are as fatal to the soul as commissions of sin.,20250223
Idolatry_ ver. 26-28,20250223
If God did not take more care of us than we do of ourselves_ we should be miserable; we would destroy ourselves_ but he would have us saved_ and devises means_ by his grace_ to undo that by which we were undoing ourselves. The former method_ by dream and vision_ was to keep back the soul from the pit (v. that is_ to prevent sin_ that we might not fall into it. This_ by sickness and the word_ is to bring back the soul_ to recover those that have fallen into sin_ that they may not lie still and perish in it. With respect to all that by repentance are brought back from the pit_ it is that they may be enlightened with the light of the living_ that they may have present comfort and everlasting happiness. Whom God saves from sin and hell_ which are darkness_ he will bring to heaven_ the inheritance of the saints in light; and this he aims at in all his institutions and all his dispensations. Lord_ what is man_ that thou shouldst thus visit him! This should engage us to comply with God's designs_ to work with him for our own good_ and not to counter-work him. This will render those that perish for ever inexcusable_ that so much was done to save them and they would not be healed,20250223
If God will not withdraw his anger (which he can do when he pleases_ for he is Lord of his anger_ lets it out or calls it in according to his will)_ the proud helpers do stoop under him; that is_ He certainly breaks and crushes those that proudly help one another against him. Proud men set themselves against God and his proceedings. In this opposition they join hand in hand. The kings of the earth set themselves_ and the rulers take counsel together_ to throw off his yoke_ to run down his truths_ and to persecute his people. Men of Israel_ help_ Acts,20250223
If I do but take one false step_ misplace a word_ or cast a look awry_ I shall be sure to hear of it. Conscience_ thy deputy_ will be sure to upbraid me with it_ and to tell me that this gripe_ this twitch of pain_ is to punish me for that.__ If God should thus mark iniquities_ we should be undone; but we must acknowledge the contrary_ that_ though we sin_ God does not deal in extremity with us. ,20250223
If Job wrote it himself_ some of the Jewish writers themselves own him a prophet among the Gentiles; if Elihu_ we find he had a spirit of prophecy which filled him with matter and constrained him_ ch.,20250223
If a man be stupid_ and dull_ and blundering in his business_ he does ill for himself (v. 5): The fool that goes about his work as if his hands were muffled and folded together_ that does every thing awkwardly_ the sluggard (for he is a fool) that loves his ease and folds his hands together to keep them warm_ because they refuse to labour_ he eats his own flesh_ is a cannibal to himself_ brings himself into such a poor condition that he has nothing to eat but his own flesh_ into such a desperate condition that he is ready to eat his own flesh for vexation. He has a dog's life—hunger and ease. Because he sees active men that thrive in the world envied_ he runs into the other extreme; and_ lest he should be envied for his right works_ he does every thing wrong_ and does not deserve to be pitied. Note_ Idleness is a sin that is its own punishment. The following words (v.,20250223
If a poor fatherless child has but an ass of his own to get a little money with_ they find some colour or other to take it away_ because the owner is not able to contest with them. It is all one if a widow has but an ox for what little husbandry she has; under pretence of distraining for some small debt_ or arrears of rent_ this ox shall be taken for a pledge_ though perhaps it is the widow's all. God has taken it among the titles of his honour to be a Father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows; and therefore those will not be reckoned his friends that do not to their utmost protect and help them; but those he will certainly reckon with as his enemies that vex and oppress them,20250223
If a poor person begged a kindness of his_ he was ready to gratify him; if he could but perceive by the widow's mournful craving look that she expected an alms from him_ though she had not confidence enough to ask it_ he had compassion enough to give it_ and never caused the eyes of the widow to fail. ,20250223
If any of the gains of iniquity_ any goods gotten by fraud or oppression_ be in thy hand_ make restitution thereof__ (as Zaccheus_ Luke xix.,20250223
If great treasure bring trouble with it_ it is for want of the fear of God. If those that have great estates would do their duty with them_ and then trust God with them_ their treasure would not have so much trouble attending it,20250223
If he be righteous_ yet he dares not lift up his head_ dares not answer as before_ ch. ix,20250223
If he be wicked_ he is certainly undone in the other world: If I be wicked_ woe to me. Note_ A sinful state is a woeful state. This we should each of us believe_ as Job here_ with application to ourselves: __If I be wicked_ though prosperous and living in pleasure_ yet woe to me.__ Some especially have reason to dread double woes if they be wicked. __I that have knowledge_ that have made a great profession of religion_ that have been so often under strong convictions_ and have made so many fair promises—I that was born of such good parents_ blessed with a good education_ that have lived in good families_ and long enjoyed the means of grace—if I be wicked_ woe_ and a thousand woes_ to me.__ ,20250223
If he has nothing to say against what is said_ Elihu lets him know that he has something more to say_ which he desires him patiently to attend to (v. 33): Hold thy peace_ and I will teach thee wisdom. Those that would both show wisdom and learn wisdom must hearken and keep silence_ be swift to hear and slow to speak. Job was wise and good; but those that are so may yet be wiser and better_ and must therefore set themselves to improve by the means of wisdom and grace.,20250223
If he looked back_ he saw all the good he had formerly enjoyed removed from him_ and nothing left him but the bitter remembrance of it: My welfare and prosperity pass away_ as suddenly_ swiftly_ and irrecoverably_ as a cloud. ,20250223
If he looked forward_ he saw every thing frightful before him: if he endeavoured to shake off his terrors_ they turned furiously upon him: if he endeavoured to escape from them_ they pursued his soul as swiftly and violently as the wind. He complained_ at first_ of the terrors of God setting themselves in array against him_ ch. vi,20250223
If he looked within_ he found his spirit quite sunk and unable to bear his infirmity_ not only wounded_ but poured out upon him_ v,20250223
If he that had the reputation of a wise man becomes an oppressor_ he becomes a madman; his reason has departed from him; he is no better than a roaring lion and a ranging bear_ and the gifts_ the bribes_ he takes_ the gains he seems to reap by his oppressions_ do but destroy his heart and quite extinguish the poor remains of sense and virtue in him_ and therefore he is rather to be pitied than envied; let him alone_ and he will act so foolishly_ and drive so furiously_ that in a little time he will ruin himself.,20250223
If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me_ and plead against me my reproach:,20250223
If iniquity be in thine hand_ put it far away_ and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. 15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea_ thou shalt be stedfast_ and shalt not fear:,20250223
If it charged him with what was false_ he doubted not but to disprove the allegations_ that his innocency would be cleared up as the light_ and he should come off with so much the more honour. But_ ,20250223
If it discovered to him any sin he had been guilty of_ which he did not yet see_ he should be glad to know it_ that he might repent of it and get it pardoned. A good man is willing to know the worst of himself and will be thankful to those that will faithfully tell him of his faults. ,20250223
If men be wicked and corrupt_ their wealth will but the more expose them: The foolishness of fools_ put them in what condition you will_ is folly_ and will show itself and shame them; if they have riches_ they do mischief with them and are the more hardened in their foolish practices.,20250223
If men be wise and good_ riches make them so much the more honourable and useful: The crown of the wise is their riches; their riches make them to be so much the more respected_ and give them the more authority and influence upon others. Those that have wealth_ and wisdom to use it_ will have a great opportunity of honouring God and doing good in the world. Wisdom is good without an inheritance_ but better with it,20250223
If men go about to seize him_ so formidable is he that the very sight of him will appal them_ and make a stout man ready to faint away: Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? and will not that deter the pursuers from their attempt? Job is told_ at his peril_ to lay his hand upon him_ v,20250223
If men would consider that a lie comes from the devil_ and brings to hell-fire_ surely that would spoil the sport of it; it is casting arrows and death to themselves.,20250223
If not cut down immediately_ yet he flees as a shadow_ and never continues in one stay_ in one shape_ but the fashion of it passes away; so does this world_ and our life in it_ 1 Cor. vii. 31.,20250223
If old people be found in the way of righteousness_ their age will be their honour. Old age_ as such_ is honourable_ and commands respect (Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head_ Lev. xix. 32); but_ if it be found in the way of wickedness_ its honour is forfeited_ its crown profaned and laid in the dust_ Isa. lxv,20250223
If one enemy of God's kingdom fall under his judgment_ the rest come proudly to help that_ and think to deliver that out of his hand: but in vain; unless he pleases to withdraw his anger (which he often does_ for it is the day of his patience) the proud helpers stoop under him_ and fall with those whom they designed to help. Who knows the power of God's anger? Those who think they have strength enough to help others will not be able to help themselves against it.,20250223
If our hearts condemn us not for hypocrisy and impenitency_ then have we confidence in our approaches to God and expectations from him_ 1 John iii,20250223
If our religion be our companion_ it will be our convoy: __Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely. The natural life_ and all that belongs to it_ shall be under the protection of God's providence; the spiritual life_ and all its interests_ are under the protection of his grace; so that thou shalt be kept from falling into sin or trouble.__ Wisdom will direct us into_ and keep us in_ the safe way_ as far as may be_ from temptation_ and will enable us to walk in it with holy security. The way of duty is the way of safety. __We are in danger of falling_ but wisdom will keep thee_ that thy foot shall not stumble at those things which are an offence and overthrow to many_ but which thou shalt know how to get over.__ ,20250223
If sin had not entered_ we may suppose there would have been no such disorder among the creatures_ but the wolf and the lamb would have lain down together. ,20250223
If that which comes from within_ out of the heart_ be good_ and from a good treasure_ it will return with advantage. Inward comfort and satisfaction will be daily bread; nay_ it will be a continual feast to those who delight in that communication which is to the use of edifying,20250223
If the fire of God_ which fell upon Job's honest servants_ who were in the way of their duty_ had fallen upon the Sabean and Chaldean robbers who were doing mischief_ God's judgments therein would have been like the great mountains_ evident and conspicuous; but when the way of the wicked prospers_ and they carry off their booty_ while just and good men are suddenly cut off_ God's righteousness is like the great deep_ the bottom of which we cannot find_ Ps. xxxvi. 6.,20250223
If the law be a lottery (as some have called it)_ it were as well that a lottery were the law.,20250223
If the poor were injured or oppressed_ they might cry to Job_ and_ if he found the allegations of their petitions true_ they had not only his ear and his bowels_ but his hand too: He delivered the poor that cried (v. 12) and would not suffer them to be trampled upon and run down. Nay (v. he was a father to the poor_ not only a judge to protect them and to see that they were not wronged_ but a father to provide for them and to see that they did not want_ to counsel and direct them_ and to appear and act for them upon all occasions. It is no disparagement to the son of a prince to be a father to the poor. ,20250223
If the scorner will not be recovered from his sin_ the disease being inveterate_ yet the simple will beware of venturing upon the sin which exposes men thus. If it cure not the infected_ it may prevent the spreading of the infection,20250223
If there be mutual enmity and strife_ though there be a whole ox for dinner_ a fat ox_ there can be no comfort in it; the leaven of malice_ of hating and being hated_ is enough to sour it all. Some refer it to him that makes the entertainment; better have a slender dinner and be heartily welcome than a table richly spread with a grudging evil eye.,20250223
If there be no forgiveness with God (ch. vii. who will fear him? Ps. cxxx.,20250223
If there be occasion_ we must reprove them; for wise men are not so perfectly wise but there is that in them which needs a reproof; and we must not connive at any man's faults because we have a veneration for his wisdom_ nor must a wise man think that his wisdom exempts him from reproof when he says or does any thing foolishly; but the more wisdom a man has the more desirous he should be to have his weaknesses shown him_ because a little folly is a great blemish to him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. ,20250223
If there were any impurity in his prayers_ he wished they might not be accepted: Let my cry have no place. He was willing to be judged by that rule_ If I regard iniquity in my heart_ the Lord will not hear me_ Ps. lxvi,20250223
If there were any injustice in his hands_ he wished it might not be concealed: O earth! cover thou not my blood_ that is_ __the innocent blood of others_ which I am suspected to have shed.__ Murder will out; and __let it___ says Job_ __if I have ever been guilty if it___ Gen. iv. 10_ 11. The day is coming when the earth shall disclose her blood (Isa. xxvi.,20250223
If they continue seeking Christ and longing after him_ even when he seems to withdraw from them_ he will graciously return to them in due time_ perhaps sooner than they think and with a pleasing surprise. No chariots sent for Christ shall return empty,20250223
If they flee when none pursues_ what will they do when they shall see God himself pursuing them with his armies? Job xx. 24; xv,20250223
If they repent not_ that will be an earnest of worse. By these you may know there is a judgment_ not only a present government_ but a future judgment_ in which hard speeches must be accounted for.,20250223
If those whom we think wise and good at any time speak that which is foolish and bad_ we ought to reprove them faithfully for it and show them the evil of what they say_ that we suffer not sin upon them. ,20250223
If thou be wise_ thou shalt be wise for thyself_ Prov. ix,20250223
If thou canst answer me_ set thy words in order before me_ stand up. 6 Behold_ I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. 7 Behold_ my terror shall not make thee afraid_ neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.,20250223
If thou hadst as much wealth as ever thou hadst_ that would not ease thee_ would not secure thee from the strokes of God's wrath_ in the day of the revelation of which riches profit not___,20250223
If thou have borne him hence_ meaning Christ_ but not naming him. The heart has been before taken up with the thoughts of him_ and to this relative those thoughts were the antecedent_ that good matter which the heart was inditing_ Ps. xlv. 1. Those that are full of Christ themselves are ready to think that others should be so too. Two things the spouse desires_ and pleases herself with the thoughts of:—,20250223
If thou sayest_ Behold_ we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul_ doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?,20250223
If thou seekest her as silver_ and searchest for her as for hid treasures,20250223
If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee_ and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 7 Though thy beginning was small_ yet thy latter end should greatly increase.,20250223
If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes_ and make thy supplication to the Almighty,20250223
If we are looked upon in the face of the anointed_ our faces_ that were dejected_ may be lifted up—that were polluted_ being washed with the blood of Christ_ may be lifted up without spot. We may draw near in full assurance of faith when we are sprinkled from an evil conscience_ Heb. x,20250223
If we are weaving to ourselves holy garments and robes of righteousness_ we shall have the benefit of them when our work comes to be reviewed and every man shall reap as he sowed and wear as he wove.,20250223
If we be careful to give Christ the praise of our church-privileges_ we may then take to ourselves the comfort and benefit of them. If the owner of the vineyard have had his due_ the keepers of it shall be well paid for their cares and pains; they shall have 200_ which sum_ no doubt_ was looked upon as a good profit. Those that work for Christ are working for themselves_ and shall be unspeakable gainers by it.,20250223
If we be such fools as to place our happiness in visible good things_ what will become of us when they shall be for ever hidden from our eyes_ and we shall no more see good? Let us therefore live by that faith which is the substance and evidence of things not seen. ,20250223
If we compare not only the end_ but the way_ we shall find that religion has the advantage; for_,20250223
If we ever thought evil_ let us lay our hand upon our mouth to suppress the evil thought (Prov. xxx. and let us by no means utter it; that is putting an imprimatur to it_ publishing it with allowance_ to the dishonour of God and the damage of others. Observe_ When men have cast off fear and prayer their mouths utter iniquity. Those that cease to do good soon learn to do evil. What can we expect but all manner of iniquity from those that arm not themselves with the grace of God against it? But thou choosest the tongue of the crafty_ that is_ __Thou utterest thy iniquity with some show and pretence of piety_ mixing some good words with the bad_ as tradesmen do with their wares to help them off.__ The mouth of iniquity could not do so much mischief as it does without the tongue of the crafty. The serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety. See Rom. xvi,20250223
If we fly off from God and our duty_ or fly out into anything amiss_ it is our own heart that carries us away. If thou scornest_ thou alone shalt bear it. There is a violence_ an ungovernable impetus_ in the turnings of the soul; the corrupt heart carries men away_ as it were_ by force_ against their convictions. __What is it that thy eyes wink at? Why so careless and mindless of what is said to thee_ hearing it as if thou wert half asleep? Why so scornful_ disdaining what we say_ as if it were below thee to take notice of it? What have we said that deserves to be thus slighted—nay_ that thou turnest thy spirit against God?__ It was bad that his heart was carried away from God_ but much worse that it was turned against God. But those that forsake God will soon break out in open enmity to him. But how did this appear? Why_ __Thou lettest such words go out of thy mouth_ reflecting on God_ and his justice and goodness.__ It is the character of the wicked that they set their mouth against the heavens (Ps. lxxiii. which is a certain indication that the spirit is turned against God. He thought Job's spirit was soured against God_ and so turned from what it had been_ and exasperated at his dealings with him. Eliphaz wanted candour and charity_ else he would not have put such a harsh construction upon the speeches of one that had such a settled reputation for piety and was now in temptation. This was_ in effect_ to give the cause on Satan's side_ and to own that Job had done as Satan said he would_ had cursed God to his face.,20250223
If we have been drawn into this snare_ it will be our wisdom by all means_ with all speed_ to get out of it_ v. 3-5. It sleeps for the present; we hear nothing of it. The debt is not demanded; the principal says_ __Never fear_ we will take care of it.__ But still the bond is in force_ interest is running on_ the creditor may come upon thee when he will and perhaps may be hasty and severe_ the principal may prove either knavish or insolvent_ and then thou must rob thy wife and children_ and ruin thy family_ to pay that which thou didst neither nor drink for. And therefore deliver thyself; rest not till either the creditor give up the bond or the principal give thee counter-security; when thou art come into the hand of thy friend_ and he has advantage against thee_ it is no time to threaten or give ill language (that will provoke and make ill worse)_ but humble thyself_ beg and pray to be discharged_ go down on thy knees to him_ and give him all the fair words thou canst; engage thy friends to speak for thee; leave no stone unturned till thou hast agreed with thy adversary and compromised the matter_ so that thy bond may not come against thee or thine. This is a care which may well break thy sleep_ and let it do so till thou hast got through. __Give not sleep to thy eyes till thou hast delivered thyself. Strive and struggle to the utmost_ and hasten with all speed_ as a roe or a bird delivers herself out of this snare of the fowler or hunter. Delays are dangerous_ and feeble efforts will not serve.__ See what care God_ in his word_ has taken to make men good husbands of their estates_ and to teach them prudence in the management of them. Godliness has precepts_ as well as promises_ relating to the life that now is.,20250223
If we have food and raiment_ and wherewithal to give every body his own_ we have enough_ and ought to be not only content_ but thankful. ,20250223
If we have not a heart to make use of them_ they occasion a great deal of uneasiness_ ver,20250223
If we hide them in our hearts_ they will be very pleasing and yield us an abundant satisfaction (v. 18): __It is a pleasant thing_ and will be thy constant entertainment_ if thou keep them within thee; if thou digest them_ and be actuated and governed by them_ and delivered into them as into a mould.__ The form of godliness_ when that is rested in_ is but a force put upon a man_ and he does but do penance in that white clothing; those only that submit to the power of godliness_ and make heart-work of it_ find the pleasure of it_ ch. ii,20250223
If we make our peace with God_ we may with cheerfulness look our friends in the face.,20250223
If we make use of them in our discourse_ they will be very becoming_ and gain us a good reputation. They shall be fitted in thy lips. __Speak of these things_ and thou speakest like thyself_ and as is fit for thee to speak considering thy character; thou wilt also have pleasure in speaking of these things as well as in thinking of them.__,20250223
If we receive so much good for the body_ shall we not receive some good for the soul; that is_ some afflictions_ by which we partake of God's holiness (Heb. xii. something which_ by saddening the countenance_ makes the heart better? Let murmuring therefore_ as well as boasting_ be for ever excluded.,20250223
If we speak wisely and well_ it will redound to our own comfort and to the advantage of others: A man has joy by the answer of his mouth; he may take a pleasure_ but may by no means take a pride_ in having spoken so acceptably and well that the hearers admire him and say_ __How good is it_ and how much good does it do!__,20250223
If we were to make an entertainment_ of all people we should not care for_ much less court_ the company of such_ but rather of philosophers and learned men_ that we might hear their wisdom_ and whose table-talk would be improving. __Have I need of madmen?__ But Wisdom invites such_ because what she has to give is what they most need_ and it is their welfare that she consults_ and aims at_ in the preparation and invitation. He that is simple is invited_ that he may be made wise_ and he that wants a heart (so the word is) let him come hither_ and he shall have one. Her preparations are rather physic than food_ designed for the most valuable and desirable cure_ that of the mind. Whosoever he be_ the invitation is general_ and excludes none that do not exclude themselves; though they be ever so foolish_ yet_ ,20250223
If you wish to gain affection_ bestow it.—Sen. Ut ameris_ amabilis esto—,20250223
If_ on the contrary_ a man is made by his praise more thankful to God_ more respectful to his friends_ more watchful against every thing that may blemish his reputation_ more diligent to improve himself_ and do good to others_ that he may answer the expectations of his friends from him_ by this it will appear that he is a wise and good man. He has a good temper of mind who knows how to pass by evil report and good report_ and is still the same_ 2 Cor. vi. 8.,20250223
Ill-gotten gains will not prosper: He that sows iniquity_ that does an unjust thing in hopes to get by it_ shall reap vanity; what he gets will never do him any good nor give him any satisfaction. He will meet nothing but disappointment. Those that create trouble to others do but prepare trouble for themselves. Men shall reap as they sow,20250223
Immoderate labour_ that we may have to hoard_ is our sin and folly,20250223
Immutability of God's Counsel; The Extent of Mortality.,20250223
Impunity hardens sinners in impiety_ and the patience of God is shamefully abused by many who_ instead of being led by it to repentance_ are confirmed by it in their impenitence. ,20250223
In a day of adversity (and that is but a day too) consider. Times of affliction are proper times for consideration_ then God calls to consider (Hag. i. then_ if ever_ we are disposed to it_ and no good will be gotten by the affliction without it. We cannot answer God's end in afflicting us unless we consider why and wherefore he contends with us. And consideration is necessary also to our comfort and support under our afflictions.,20250223
In a day of prosperity (and it is but a day)_ we must be joyful_ be in good_ be doing good_ and getting good_ maintain a holy cheerfulness_ and serve the Lord with gladness of heart in the abundance of all things. __When the world smiles_ rejoice in God_ and praise him_ and let the joy of the Lord be thy strength.__ ,20250223
In a word_ Job was the greatest of all the men of the east; and they were the richest in the world: those were rich indeed who were replenished more than the east_ Isa. ii,20250223
In all labour there is profit; and yet here he denies that there is any profit. As to our present condition in the world_ it is true that by labour we get that which we call profit; we eat the labour of our hands; but as the wealth of the world is commonly called substance_ and yet it is that which is not (Prov. xxii. so it is called profit_ but the question is whether it be really so or no. And here he determines that it is not_ that it is not a real benefit_ that it is not a remaining benefit. In short_ the wealth and pleasure of this world_ if we had ever so much of them_ are not sufficient to make us happy_ nor will they be a portion for us. ,20250223
In all our comforts. God gave us our being_ made us_ and not we ourselves_ gave us our wealth; it was not our own ingenuity or industry that enriched us_ but God's blessing on our cares and endeavours. He gave us power to get wealth_ not only made the creatures for us_ but best owed upon us our share. ,20250223
In all our crosses. The same that gave hath taken away; and may he not do what he will with his own? See how Job looks above instruments_ and keeps his eye upon the first Cause. He does not say_ __The Lord gave_ and the Sabeans and Chaldeans have taken away; God made me rich_ and the devil has made me poor;__ but_ __He that gave has taken;__ and for that reason he is dumb_ and has nothing to say_ because God did it. He that gave all may take what_ and when_ and how much he pleases. Seneca could argue thus_ Abstulit_ sed et dedit—he took away_ but he also gave; and Epictetus excellently (cap.,20250223
In all the conferences between Job and his friends we do not find any more weighty and considerable lines than these; would one have expected it? Here is much both of Christ and heaven in these verses: and he that said such things as these declared plainly that he sought the better country_ that is_ the heavenly; as the patriarchs of that age did_ Heb. xi,20250223
In all this Job did not act amiss_ for he did not attribute folly to God_ nor in the least reflect upon his wisdom in what he had done. Discontent and impatience do in effect charge God with folly. Against the workings of these therefore Job carefully watched; and so must we_ acknowledging that as God has done right_ but we have done wickedly_ so God has done wisely_ but we have done foolishly_ very foolishly. Those who not only keep their temper under crosses and provocations_ but keep up good thoughts of God and sweet communion with him_ whether their praise be of men or no_ it will be of God_ as Job's here was.,20250223
In all this we may see,20250223
In all this_ we must remember to magnify the work of God.,20250223
In comparison with God. Man's righteousness and holiness_ at the best_ are nothing to God's_ Ps. lxxxix,20250223
In compassion to Job_ because he was poor and in affliction_ would not make his case better than he really took it to be_ for fear of increasing his grief; __but_ let him bear it as he can_ he shall be told the truth.__ Those that are in affliction must not be flattered_ but dealt faithfully with. When trouble is upon any it is foolish pity to suffer sin upon them too (Lev. xix. for that is the worst addition that can be to their trouble. Thou shalt not countenance_ any more than discountenance_ a poor man in his cause (Exod. xxiii. nor regard a sad look any more than a big look_ so as_ for the sake of it_ to pervert justice_ for that is accepting persons. Or_ ,20250223
In compliment to Job's friends_ because they were in prosperity and reputation. Let them not expect that he should say as they said_ any further than he was convinced that they say right_ nor applaud their dictates for the sake of their dignities. No_ though Elihu is a young man_ and upon his preferment_ he will not dissemble truth to court the favour of great men. It is a good resolution he has taken up—__I know not to give flattering titles to men; I never used myself to flattering language;__ and it is a good reason he gives for that resolution—in so doing my Maker would soon take my away. It is good to keep ourselves in awe with a holy fear of God's judgments. He that made us will take us away in his wrath is we do not conduct ourselves as we should. He hates all dissimulation and flattery_ and will soon put lying lips to silence and cut off flattering lips_ Ps. xii,20250223
In consideration of the judgment to come_ and the strictness of that judgment_ it highly concerns us now to be very strict in our walking with God_ that we may give up our account with joy.,20250223
In death all their excellency passes away; beauty_ strength_ learning_ not only cannot secure them from death_ but must die with them_ nor shall their pomp_ their wealth_ or power_ descend after them. ,20250223
In death they are destroyed_ and perish for ever_ as to this world; it is the final period of their lives_ and all the employments and enjoyments here; their place will know them no more. ,20250223
In death: he gives up the ghost; the soul leaves the body_ and returns to God who gave it_ the Father of spirits. ,20250223
In debate with God. He that will quarrel with the word and providence of God must unavoidably go by the worst. God will be justified_ and then man will be condemned_ Ps. li. 4; Rom. iii,20250223

In gathering some gleaning of this harvest for others we may feast ourselves; and_ when we are enabled by the grace of God to do so_ we are best qualified to feed others. I was much pleased with a passage I lately met with of Erasmus_ that great scholar and celebrated wit_ in an epistle dedicatory before his book De Ratione Concionandi_ where_ as one weary of the world and the hurry of it_ he expresses an earnest desire to spend the rest of his days in secret communion with Jesus Christ_ encouraged by his gracious invitation to those who labour and are heavy laden to come unto him for rest (Matt. xi. and this alone is that which he thinks will yield him true satisfaction. I think his words worth transcribing_ and such as deserve to be inserted among the testimonies of great men to serious godliness. Neque quisquam facilè credat quàm miserè animus jamdudum affectet ab his laboribus in tranquillam otium secedere_ quodque superest vitæ (superest autem vix brevis palmus sive pugillus)_ solum cum eo solo colloqui_ qui clamavit olim (nec hodiè mutat vocem suam)_ __Venite ad me_ omnes qui laboratis et onerati estis_ ego reficiam vos;__ quandoquidem in tam turbulento_ ne dicam furente_ sæculo_ in tot molestiis quas vel ipsa tempora publicè invehunt_ vel privatim adfert oetas ac valetudo_ nihil reperio in quo mens mea libentius conquiescat quàm in hoc arcano colloquio—No one will easily believe how anxiously_ for a long time past_ I have wished to retire from these labours into a scene of tranquility_ and_ during the remainder of life (dwindled_ it is true_ to the shortest span)_ to converse only with him who once cried (nor does he now retract)_ __Come unto me_ all you that labour and are heavy laden_ and I will refresh you___ for in this turbulent_ not to say furious_ age_ the many public sources of disquietude_ connected with the infirmities of advancing age_ leave no solace to my mind to be compared with this secret communion. In the pleasing contemplation of the divine beauty and benignity we hope to spend a blessed eternity_ and therefore in this work it is good t o spend as much as may be of our time.,20250223
In general_ that we may not use our estates as we will (he that gave them to us has reserved to himself a power to direct us how we shall use them_ for they are not our own; we are but stewards)_ and further that God in his law consults our interests and teaches us that charity which begins at home_ as well as that which must not end there. There is a good husbandry which is good divinity_ and a discretion in ordering our affairs which is part of the character of a good man_ Ps. cxii,20250223
In general_ the price of it is very great; it is of inestimable value_ ver. 15-19. The place of it is very secret_ ver. 14_ 20_ 22. In particular_ there is a wisdom which is hidden in God (ver. 23-27) and there is a wisdom which is revealed to the children of men_ ver,20250223
In hearing the word_ and offering sacrifice_ ver. 1,20250223
In heaven there is perfect peace; for there is perfect holiness_ and there is God_ who is love. ,20250223
In its rise_ it looks forth as the morning after a dark night; it is discovering (Job xxxviii. 12_ and very acceptable_ looks forth pleasantly as a clear morning; but it is small in its beginnings_ and scarcely perceptible at first. ,20250223
In length of acquaintance with the world_ which furnishes men with so much the more experience: __Art thou the first man that was born; and_ consequently_ senior to us_ and better able to give the sense of antiquity and the judgment of the first and earliest_ the wisest and purest_ ages? Art thou prior to Adam?__ So it may be read. __Did not he suffer for sin; and yet wilt not thou_ who art so great a sufferer_ own thyself a sinner? Wast thou made before the hills_ as Wisdom herself was? Prov. viii. 23_ &c. Must God's counsels_ which are as the great mountains (Ps. xxxvi. and immovable as the everlasting hills_ be subject to thy notions and bow to them? Dost thou know more of the world than any of us do? No_ thou art but of yesterday even as we are___ ch. viii,20250223
In like manner_ those that indulge themselves in sin are fitting themselves for destruction. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits the more eagerly bent he is upon his own destruction; he awakens it when it seemed to slumber and hastens it when it seemed to linger.,20250223
In making vows_ ver. 4-6,20250223
In most disputes the strife is who shall have the last word. Job's friends had_ in this controversy_ tamely yielded it to Job_ and then he to Elihu. But_ after all the wranglings of the counsel at bar_ the judge upon the bench must have the last word; so God had here_ and so he will have in every controversy_ for every man's judgment proceeds from him and by his definitive sentence every man must stand or fall and every cause be won or lost. Job had often appealed to God_ and had talked boldly how he would order his cause before him_ and as a prince would he go near unto him; but_ when God took the throne_ Job had nothing to say in his own defence_ but was silent before him. It is not so easy a matter as some think it to contest with the Almighty. Job's friends had sometimes appealed to God too: __O that God would speak!__ ch. xi,20250223
In order hereunto_ to keep them from pondering the path of life_ from considering how reasonable it is that they should walk in that path_ and how much it will be for their advantage. Be it observed_ to the honour of religion_ that it certainly gains its point with all those that will but allow themselves the liberty of a serious thought and will weigh things impartially in an even balance_ and that the devil has no way of securing men in his interests but by diverting them with continual amusements of one kind or another from the calm and sober consideration of the things that belong to their peace. And uncleanness is a sin that does as much as any thing blind the understanding_ sear the conscience_ and keep people from pondering the path of life. Whoredom takes away the heart_ Hos. iv. 11.,20250223
In order thereunto to grow in grace. He will not only hold on his way notwithstanding_ but will grow stronger and stronger. By the sight of other good men's trials_ and the experience of his own_ he will be made more vigorous and lively in his duty_ more warm and affectionate_ more resolute and undaunted; the worse others are the better he will be; that which dismays others emboldens him. The blustering wind makes the traveller gather his cloak the closer about him and gird it the faster. Those that are truly wise and good will be continually growing wiser and better. Proficiency in religion is a good sign of sincerity in it.,20250223
In order to the attaining of all useful knowledge this is most necessary_ that we fear God; we are not qualified to profit by the instructions that are given us unless our minds be possessed with a holy reverence of God_ and every thought within us be brought into obedience to him. If any man will do his will_ he shall know of his doctrine_ John vii,20250223
In order to this we must keep out of the ways of sinners_ and have no fellowship with them. For fear of falling into wicked courses_ we must shun wicked company. Here is_,20250223
In order to this_ children must be trained up under a strict discipline_ and not suffered to do what they will and to go without rebuke when they do amiss. The foolishness bound up in their hearts must by correction be driven out when they are young_ or it will break out_ to their own and their parents' shame_ when they are grown up.,20250223
In our care concerning ourselves. We are all concerned to see to it that the root of the matter be found in us. A living_ quickening_ commanding_ principle of grace in the heart_ is the root of the matter_ as necessary to our religion as the root to the tree_ to which it owes both its fixedness and its fruitfulness. Love to God and our brethren_ faith in Christ_ hatred of sin—these are the root of the matter; other things are but leaves in comparison with these. Serious godliness is the one thing needful. ,20250223
In our conduct towards our brethren. We are to believe that many have the root of the matter in them who are not in every thing of our mind—who have their follies_ and weaknesses_ and mistakes—and to conclude that it is at our peril if we persecute any such. Woe be to him that offends one of those little ones! God will resent and revenge it. Job and his friends differed in some notions concerning the methods of Providence_ but they agreed in the root of the matter_ the belief of another world_ and therefore should not persecute one another for these differences.,20250223
In our retirements we lie exposed and are most subject to frights. __But keep up communion with God_ and keep a good conscience_ and then when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid of fire_ or thieves_ or specters_ or any of the terrors of darkness_ knowing that when we_ and all our friends_ are asleep_ yet he that keeps Israel and every true-born Israelite neither slumbers nor sleeps_ and to him thou hast committed thyself and taken shelter under the shadow of his wings. Thou shalt lie down_ and not need to sit up to keep guard; having lain down_ thou shalt sleep_ and not have thy eyes held waking by care and fear; and thy sleep shall be sweet and refreshing to thee_ being not disturbed by any alarms from without or from within___ Ps. iv. 8; cxvi,20250223
In our troubles we expect comfort and relief from our relations_ but sometimes there is a friend_ that is nothing akin to us_ the bonds of whose esteem and love prove stronger than those of nature_ and_ when it comes to the trial_ will do more for us than a brother will. Christ is a friend to all believers that sticks closer than a brother; to him therefore let them show themselves friendly.,20250223
In prayer_ ver. 2_ 3,20250223
In pretending to divine dreams_ ver,20250223
In respect of honour and reputation: It shall be grace to thy neck_ as a chain of gold_ or a jewel. Grace to thy jaws (so the word is)_ grateful to thy taste and relish (so some); it shall infuse grace into all thou sayest (so others)_ shall furnish thee with acceptable words_ which shall gain thee credit,20250223
In respect of safety and security. This he insists upon in four verses_ the scope of which is to show that the effect of righteousness (which is the same with wisdom here) is quietness and assurance for ever_ Isa. xxxii,20250223
In respect of the body we must go as we came; the dust shall return to the earth as it was. But sad is our case if the soul return as it came_ for we were born in sin_ and if we die in sin_ unsanctified_ we had better never have been born; and that seems to be the case of the worldling here spoken of_ for he is said to return in all points as he came_ as sinful_ as miserable_ and much more so. This is a sore evil; he thinks it so whose heart is glued to the world_ that he shall take nothing of his labour which he may carry away in his hand; his riches will not go with him into another world nor stand him in any stead there. If we labour in religion_ the grace and comfort we get by that labour we may carry away in our hearts_ and shall be the better for it to eternity; that is meat that endures. But if we labour only for the world_ to fill our hands with that_ we cannot take that away with us; we are born with our hands griping_ but we die with them extended_ letting go what we held fast. So that_ upon the whole matter_ he may well ask_ What profit has he that has laboured for the wind? Note_ Those that labour for the world labour for the wind_ for that which has more sound than substance_ which is uncertain_ and always shifting its point_ unsatisfying_ and often hurtful_ which we cannot hold fast_ and which_ if we take up with it as our portion_ will no more feed us than the wind_ Hos. xii. 1. Men will see that they have laboured for the wind when at death they find the profit of their labour is all gone_ gone like the wind_ they know not whither.,20250223
In respect of the mischief he does to his subjects. He is dreadful as the roaring lion_ who makes the forest tremble; he is devouring as a hungry bear_ and the more necessitous he is the more mischief he does and the more greedy of gain he is.,20250223
In revenge_ because when he was in prosperity and power_ like a good magistrate_ he put in execution the laws which were in force against vagabonds_ and rogues_ and sturdy beggars_ which these base people now remembered against him. ,20250223
In seeing the wicked destroyed_ v,20250223
In seeing themselves distinguished (v. 20): __Whereas our substance is not cut down_ as theirs was_ and as thine is; we continue to prosper_ which is a sign that we are the favourites of Heaven_ and in the right.__ The same rule that served him to condemn Job by served him to magnify himself and his companions by. His substance is cut down; therefore he is a wicked man; ours is not; therefore we are righteous. But it is a deceitful rule to judge by; for none knows love or hatred by all that is before him. If others be consumed_ and we be not_ instead of censuring them and lifting up ourselves_ as Eliphaz does here_ we ought to be thankful to God and take it for a warning to ourselves to prepare for similar calamities.,20250223
In the Old Testament we often find women praised for their beauty_ as Sarah_ Rebekah_ and many others; but we never find any women in the New Testament whose beauty is in the least taken notice of_ no_ not the virgin Mary herself_ because the beauty of holiness is that which is brought to a much clearer light by the gospel. ,20250223
In the acts of righteousness govern thyself by the rules of prudence_ and be not transported_ no_ not by a zeal for God_ into any intemperate heats or passions_ or any practices unbecoming thy character or dangerous to thy interests.__ Note_ There may be over-doing in well-doing. Self-denial and mortification of the flesh are good; but if we prejudice our health by them_ and unfit ourselves for the service of God_ we are righteous overmuch. To reprove those that offend is good_ but to cast that pearl before swine_ who will turn again and rend us_ is to be righteous overmuch. __Make not thyself over-wise. Be not opinionative_ and conceited of thy own abilities. Set not up for a dictator_ nor pretend to give law to_ and give judgment upon_ all about thee. Set not up for a critic_ to find fault with every thing that is said and done_ nor busy thyself in other men's matters_ as if thou knewest every thing and couldst do any thing. Why shouldst thou destroy thyself_ as fools often do by meddling with strife that belongs not to them? Why shouldst thou provoke authority_ and run thyself into the briers_ by needless contradictions_ and by going out of thy sphere to correct what is amiss? Be wise as serpents; beware of men.__ ,20250223
In the administration of justice much depends upon the witnesses_ and therefore it is necessary to the common good that witnesses be principled as they ought to be; for,20250223
In the consolation of saints. A soul convinced of sin_ and truly humbled for it_ is in a wilderness_ quite at a loss; and there is no coming out of this wilderness but leaning on Christ as our beloved_ by faith_ and not leaning to our own understanding_ nor trusting to any righteousness or strength of our own as sufficient for us_ but going forth_ and going on_ in the strength of the Lord God_ and making mention of his righteousness_ even his only_ who is the Lord our righteousness,20250223
In the conversion of sinners. A sinful state is a wilderness_ remote from communion with God_ barren and dry_ and in which there is no true comfort; it is a wandering wanting state. Out of this wilderness we are concerned to come up_ by true repentance_ in the strength of the grace of Christ_ supported by our beloved and carried in his arms,20250223
In the day of adversity we are apt to faint_ to droop and be discouraged_ to desist from our work_ and to despair of relief. Our spirits sink_ and then our hands hang down and our knees grow feeble_ and we become unfit for anything. And often those that are most cheerful when they are well droop most_ and are most dejected_ when any thing ails them,20250223
In the day the drought consumed me_ but_ The sun has looked upon me; for it becomes not God's suffering people to make the worst of their sufferings. But what was the matter? ,20250223
In the foregoing verse the thoughts of the wicked and righteous were compared; here their words_ and those are as the abundance of the heart is. 1. Wicked people speak mischief to their neighbours; and wicked indeed those are whose words are to lie in wait for blood; their tongues are swords to those that stand in their way_ to good men whom they hate and persecute. See an instance_ Luke xx. 20_ 21,20250223

In the frost_ v,20250223
In the fulness of his sufficiency_ when he thinks himself most happy_ and most sure of the continuance of his happiness_ he shall be in straits_ that is_ he shall think himself so_ through the anxieties and perplexities of his own mind_ as that rich man who_ when his ground brought forth plentifully_ cried out_ What shall I do? Luke xii. 17.,20250223
In the judgment to come_ it is certain_ God will not hear the cry of those who lived and died in their hypocrisy. Their doleful lamentations will all be unpitied. I will laugh at your calamity. Their importunate petitions will all be thrown out and their pleas rejected. Inflexible justice cannot be biassed_ nor the irreversible sentence revoked. See Matt. vii. 22_ 23; Luke xiii. 26_ and the case of the foolish virgins_ Matt. xxv. 11.,20250223
In the midst of all these childish delights he preserved his spirit manly_ kept the possession of his own soul_ and maintained the dominion of reason over the appetites of sense; such a vast stock of wisdom had he that it was not wasted and impaired_ as any other man's would have been_ by this course of life. But let none be emboldened hereby to lay the reins on the neck of their appetites_ presuming that they may do that and yet retain their wisdom_ for they have not such a strength of wisdom as Solomon had; nay_ and Solomon was deceived; for how did his wisdom remain with him when he lost his religion so far as to build altars to strange gods_ for the humouring of his strange wives? But thus far his wisdom remained with him that he was master of his pleasures_ and not a slave to them_ and kept himself capable of making a judgment of them. He went over into the enemies' country_ not as a deserter_ but as a spy_ to discover the nakedness of their land. ,20250223
In the midst of his prosperity he thought of dying_ and the thought was not uneasy to him. He knew that_ though his nest was high_ it did not set him out of the reach of the darts of death,20250223
In the midst of our communion with one another we must not neglect our communion with Christ_ but let him see our countenance and hear our voice; he here bespeaks it: __The companions hearken to thy voice; it is a pleasure to them; cause me to hear it. Thou makest thy complaints to them when any thing grieves thee; why does thou not bring them to me_ and let me hear them? Thou art free with them; be as free with me; pour out thy heart to me.__ Thus Christ_ when he left his disciples_ ordered them to send to him upon every occasion. Ask_ and you shall receive. Note_ Christ not only accepts and answers_ but even courts his people's prayers_ not reckoning them a trouble to him_ but an honour and a delight_ Prov. xv,20250223
In the midst of these complaints he comforts himself with the assurance of God's clemency (ver. 6_ and his own integrity_ which God himself was a witness to_ ver. 10-12. Thus was the light of his day like that spoken of_ Zech. xiv. 6_ 7_ neither perfectly clear nor perfectly dark_ but __at evening time it was light.__,20250223
In the night the watchmen go about the city_ for the preservation of its peace and safety_ to guide and assist the honest and quiet_ as well as to be a check upon those that are disorderly; these met her in her walks_ and she asked them if they could give her any tidings of her beloved. In the streets and broad-ways of Jerusalem she might meet with enough to divert her from her pursuit and to entertain her_ though she could not meet her beloved; but she regards none in comparison with him. Gracious souls press through crowds of other delights and contentments in pursuit of Christ_ whom they prefer before their chief joy. Mary Magdalen sees angels in the sepulchre_ but that will not do unless she see Jesus. Saw you him whom my soul loveth? Note_ We must evince the sincerity of our love to Christ by our solicitous enquiries after him. The children of the bride-chamber will mourn when the bridegroom is taken away (Matt. ix. especially for the sin which provoked him to withdraw; and_ if we do so_ we shall be in care to recover the sense of his favour and diligent and constant in the use of proper means in order thereunto. We must search the scriptures_ be much in prayer_ keep close to ordinances_ and all with this upon our heart_ Saw you him whom my soul loveth? Those only who have seen Christ themselves are likely to direct others to a sight of him. When the Greeks came to worship at the feast they applied to Philip_ with such an address as this of the spouse to the watchmen_ Sir_ we would see Jesus_ John xii. 21.,20250223
In the opening of the gates_ and in the places of concourse_ where courts were kept_ the judges_ the wisdom of the nation_ called to wicked people_ in God's name_ to repent and reform,20250223
In the salvation of those that belong to Christ. We must go up from the wilderness of this world having our conversation in heaven; and_ at death_ we must remove thither_ leaning upon Christ_ must live and die by faith in him. To me to live is Christ_ and it is he that is gain in death.,20250223
In the serious views and reviews he had taken of the children of men and their state he had observed that many a time one man rules over another to his hurt; that is_ ,20250223
In the sight of God. If God is so great and glorious_ how can man_ who is guilty and impure_ appear before him? Note_ ,20250223

In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare.,20250223
In the winds_ which blow from different quarters and produce different effects (v. 9): Out of the hidden place (so it may be read) comes the whirlwind; it turns round_ and so it is hard to say from which point it comes but it comes from the secret chamber_ as the word signifies_ which I am not so willing to understand of the south_ because he says here (v. 17) that the wind out of the south is so far from being a whirlwind that it is a warming_ quieting_ wind. But at this time_ perhaps_ Elihu saw a whirlwind-cloud coming out of the south and making towards them_ out of which the Lord spoke soon after_ ch. xxxviii. 1. Or_ if turbulent winds which bring showers come out of the south_ cold and drying blasts come out of the north to scatter the vapours and clear the air of them.,20250223
In their greatest straits and dangers. Integrity and uprightness will preserve us_ so that we need not be afraid of sudden fear_ v,20250223
In their motions by day_ v,20250223
In their rest by night_ v,20250223
In these two verses we are invited and encouraged to live in the fear of God by the advantages which attend a religious life. The fear of the Lord is here put for all gracious principles_ producing gracious practices. 1. Where this reigns it produces a holy security and serenity of mind. There is in it a strong confidence; it enables a man still to hold fast both his purity and his peace_ whatever happens_ and gives him boldness before God and the world. I know that I shall be justified—None of these things move me; such is the language of this confidence,20250223
In these verses Solomon lays down some great truths which seem paradoxes to the unthinking part_ that is_ the far greatest part_ of mankind.,20250223
In these verses Solomon shows_,20250223
In these verses he shows how God teaches and admonishes the children of men by their own consciences. Observe_,20250223
In these verses we may observe_,20250223
In these verses_,20250223
In this and the following chapter we have Job's answer to Bildad's discourse_ wherein he speaks honourably of God_ humbly of himself_ and feelingly of his troubles; but not one word by way of reflection upon his friends_ or their unkindness to him_ nor in direct reply to what Bildad had said. He wisely keeps to the merits of the cause_ and makes no remarks upon the person that managed it_ nor seeks occasion against him. In this chapter we have_,20250223
In this and the two following chapters we have Job's answer to Zophar's discourse_ in which_ as before_ he first reasons with his friends (see ch. xiii. 19) and then turns to his God_ and directs his expostulations to him_ from thence to the end of his discourse. In this chapter he addresses himself to his friends_ and_,20250223
In this chapter Bildad makes a second assault upon Job. In his first discourse (ch. viii.) he had given him encouragement to hope that all should yet be well with him. But here there is not a word of that; he has grown more peevish_ and is so far from being convinced by Job's reasonings that he is but more exasperated.,20250223
In this chapter we have_,20250223
In this chapter_,20250223
In this chapter_ The church gives an account of a sore trial wherewith she was exercised through the withdrawing of her beloved from her_ the pains she was at before she recovered the comfortable sense of his favour again_ and the resolution she took_ when she did recover it_ not to lose it again_ as she had done through her own carelessness_ ver. 1-5.,20250223
In this chapter_ after the title of the book (ver. 1)_ we have Christ and his church_ Christ and a believer_ expressing their esteem for each other.,20250223
In this paragraph Job specifies three sorts of sinners that shun the light:—1. Murderers_ v,20250223
In this second part of Job's complaint_ which is very bitter_ and has a great many sorrowful accents in it_ we may observe a great deal that he complains of and some little that he comforts himself with.,20250223
In this song of loves and joys we have here a very melancholy scene; the spouse here speaks_ not to her beloved (as before_ for he has withdrawn)_ but of him_ and it is a sad story she tells of her own folly and ill conduct towards him_ notwithstanding his kindness_ and of the just rebukes she fell under for it. Perhaps it may refer to Solomon's own apostasy from God_ and the sad effects of that apostasy after God had come into his garden_ had taken possession of the temple he had built_ and he had feasted with God upon the sacrifices (v. 1); however_ it is applicable to the too common case both of the churches and particular believers_ who by their carelessness and security provoke Christ to withdraw from them. Observe_,20250223
In those days_ when the earth was not fully peopled_ it was as now in some of the plantations_ men might have land enough upon easy terms if they had but wherewithal to stock it; and therefore Job's substance is described_ not by the acres of land he was lord of_ but_ ,20250223
In triumph over him_ because they thought he had now become like one of them. Isa. xiv. 10_ 11. The abjects_ men of mean spirits_ insult over the miserable_ Ps.,20250223

Industry is the way to preferment. Solomon advanced Jeroboam because he saw that he was an industrious young man_ and minded his business_ 1 Kings xi,20250223
Inhumanity is impiety and irreligion. He that withholds compassion from his friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty. So the Chaldee. How dwells the love of God in that man? 1 John iii,20250223
Instead of healing salves_ he took a potsherd_ a piece of a broken pitcher_ to scrape himself withal. A very sad pass this poor man had come to. When a man is sick and sore he may bear it the better if he be well tended and carefully looked after. Many rich people have with a soft and tender hand charitably ministered to the poor in such a condition as this; even Lazarus had some ease from the tongues of the dogs that came and licked his sores; but poor Job has no help afforded him. ,20250223
Instead of reposing in a soft and warm bed_ he sat down among the ashes. Probably he had a bed left him (for_ though his fields were stripped_ we do not find that his house was burnt or plundered)_ but he chose to sit in the ashes_ either because he was weary of his bed or because he would put himself into the place and posture of a penitent_ who_ in token of his self-abhorrence_ lay in dust and ashes_ ch. xlii. 6; Isa. lviii. 5; Jonah iii,20250223
Instruction. The means of wisdom are given to all_ but wisdom itself_ sound wisdom_ is laid up for the righteous_ laid up in Christ their head_ in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge_ and who is made of God to us wisdom. The same that is the Spirit of revelation in the word is a Spirit of wisdom in the souls of those that are sanctified_ that wisdom of the prudent which is to understand his way; and it is sound wisdom_ its foundations firm_ its principles solid_ and its products of lasting advantage. ,20250223

Into a silent and sullen despair; and then the tempest of God's wrath_ the tempest of death_ may be said to steal him away in the night_ when no one is aware or takes any notice of it. Or_ ,20250223
Into an open and clamorous despair; and then he is said to be carried away_ and hurled out of his place as with a storm_ and with an east wind_ violent_ and noisy_ and very dreadful. Death_ to a godly man_ is like a fair gale of wind to convey him to the heavenly country_ but_ to a wicked man_ it is like an east wind_ a storm_ a tempest_ that hurries him away in confusion and amazement_ to destruction.,20250223
Into their hand God brings abundantly. They have more than heart could wish (Ps. lxxiii. not for necessity only_ but for delight—not for themselves only_ but for others—not for the present only_ but for hereafter; and this from the hand of Providence too. God brings plentifully to them. We cannot therefore judge of men's piety by their plenty_ nor of what they have in their heart by what they have in their hand.,20250223
Iron and brass_ less costly but more serviceable metals_ are taken out of the earth (v. and are there found in great abundance_ which abates their price indeed_ but is a great kindness to man_ who could much better be without gold than without iron. Nay_ out of the earth comes bread_ that is_ bread-corn_ the necessary support of life_ v,20250223
Is length of days a blessing? Yes_ the most valuable; life includes all good_ and therefore she offers that in her right hand. Religion puts us into the best methods of prolonging life_ entitles us to the promises of it_ and_ though our days on earth should be no more than our neighbour's_ yet it will secure to us everlasting life in a better world. ,20250223
Is pleasure courted as much as any thing? It is so_ and it is certain that true piety has in it the greatest true pleasure. Her ways are ways of pleasantness; the ways in which she has directed us to walk are such as we shall find abundance of delight and satisfaction in. All the enjoyments and entertainments of sense are not comparable to the pleasure which gracious souls have in communion with God and doing good. That which is the only right way to bring us to our journey's end we must walk in_ fair or foul_ pleasant or unpleasant; but the way of religion_ as it is the right way_ so it is a pleasant way; it is smooth and clean_ and strewed with roses: All her paths are peace. There is not only peace in the end_ but peace in the way; not only in the way of religion in general_ but in the particular paths of that way_ in all her paths_ all the several acts_ instances_ and duties of it. One does not embitter what the other sweetens_ as it is with the allays of this world; but they are all peace_ not only sweet_ but safe. The saints enter into peace on this side heaven_ and enjoy a present sabbatism.,20250223
Is woven out of his own bowels; it is the creature of his own fancy_ and arises merely from a conceit of his own merit and sufficiency. There is a great deal of difference between the work of the bee and that of the spider. A diligent Christian_ like the laborious bee_ fetches in all his comfort from the heavenly dews of God's word; but the hypocrite_ like the subtle spider_ weaves his out of a false hypothesis of his own concerning God_ as if he were altogether such a one as himself. ,20250223

It adds to the comfort of young people that are pious and discreet that thereby they do something towards recompensing their parents for all the care and pains they have taken with them_ and occasion pleasure to them in the evil days of old age_ when they most need it; and it is the duty of parents to rejoice in their children's wisdom and well-doing_ yea_ though it arrive at such an eminency as to eclipse them. ,20250223
It adds to the guilt of those that conduct themselves ill that thereby they grieve those whom they ought to be a joy to_ and are a heaviness particularly to their poor mothers who bore them with sorrow_ but with greater sorrow see them wicked and vile.,20250223
It advances him above his neighbours_ and makes him more excellent than they: Who is as the wise man? Note_ Heavenly wisdom will make a man an incomparable man. No man without grace_ though he be learned_ or noble_ or rich_ is to be compared with a man that has true grace and is therefore accepted of God,20250223
It advises us to be so discreet in ordering our affairs as not to lend money to those who are manifestly wasting their estates_ unless they give very good security for it. Foolish lending is injustice to our families. He does not say_ __Get another to be bound with him___ for he that makes himself a common voucher will have those to be his security who are as insolvent as himself; therefore take his garment.,20250223
It beautifies a man in the eyes of his friends: It makes his face to shine_ as Moses's did when he came down from the mount; it puts honour upon a man and a lustre on his whole conversation_ makes him to be regarded and taken notice of_ and gains him respect (as Job xxix. 7_ &c.); it makes him lovely and amiable_ and the darling and blessing of his country. The strength of his face_ the sourness and severity of his countenance (so some understand the last clause)_ shall be changed by it into that which is sweet and obliging. Even those whose natural temper is rough and morose by wisdom are strangely altered; they become mild and gentle_ and learn to look pleasant,20250223
It blasts the reputation. __Thou wilt give thy honour unto others (v. 9); thou wilt lose it thyself; thou wilt put into the hand of each of thy neighbours a stone to throw at thee_ for they will all_ with good reason_ cry shame on thee_ will despise thee_ and trample on thee_ as a foolish men.__ Whoredom is a sin that makes men contemptible and base_ and no man of sense or virtue will care to keep company with one that keeps company with harlots. ,20250223
It brings guilt upon the conscience and debauches that. He that touches his neighbour's wife_ with an immodest touch_ cannot be innocent_ v,20250223
It cannot be hidden from the all-seeing God. A wanton thought cannot be so close_ nor a wanton look so quick_ as to escape his cognizance_ much less any act of uncleanness so secretly done as to be out of his sight. If Job was at any time tempted to this sin_ he restrained himself from it_ and all approaches to it_ with this pertinent thought (v.,20250223
It cannot but be a great grief to princes to see themselves thus slighted by those they have studied to oblige and have depended upon; there is no faith in man_ no stedfastness. This is vanity and vexation of spirit.,20250223
It cannot either be foreseen by him or foretold him; the stars cannot foretel a man what shall be_ nor any of the arts of divination. God has_ in wisdom_ concealed from us the knowledge of future events_ that we may be always ready for changes,20250223
It concerns us to be deeply humbled for the sins we are convinced of_ and not to rest in a slight superficial displeasure against ourselves for them. Even good people_ that have no gross enormities to repent of_ must be greatly afflicted in soul for the workings and breakings out of pride_ passion_ peevishness_ and discontent_ and all their hasty unadvised speeches; for these we must be pricked to the heart and be in bitterness. Till the enemy be effectually humbled_ the peace will be insecure.,20250223
It concerns us to know what God hates and what he loves_ that we may govern ourselves accordingly_ may avoid his displeasure and recommend ourselves to his favour. Now here we are told,20250223
It consumes the substance; it roots out all the increase. Burning lusts bring burning judgments. Perhaps it alludes to the burning of Sodom_ which was intended for an example to those who should afterwards_ in like manner_ live ungodly.,20250223
It contributes much more to our safety_ and is a shelter to us from the storms of trouble and its scorching heat; it is a shadow (so the word is)_ as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. Wisdom is a defence_ and money (that is_ as money) is a defence. As a rich man makes his wealth_ so a wise man makes his wisdom_ a strong city. In the shadow of wisdom (so the words run) and in the shadow of money there is safety. He puts wisdom and money together_ to confirm what he had said before_ that wisdom is good with an inheritance. Wisdom is as a wall_ and money may serve as a thorn hedge_ which protects the field,20250223
It did not so much trouble him that his miseries came upon him in troops as that they were God's troops_ in whom it seemed as if God fought against him and intended his destruction. God's troops encamped around his tabernacle_ as soldiers lay siege to a strong city_ cutting off all provisions from being brought into it and battering it continually; thus was Job's tabernacle besieged. Time was when God's hosts encamped round him for safety: Hast thou not made a hedge about him? Now_ on the contrary_ they surrounded him_ to his terror_ and destroyed him on every side_ v. 10,20250223
It does a great deal of hurt: It is mad_ that is_ it makes men mad_ it transports men into many indecencies_ which are a reproach to their reason and religion. They are mad that indulge themselves in it_ for it estranges the heart from God and divine things_ and insensibly eats out the power of religion. Those that love to be merry forget to be serious_ and_ while they take the timbrel and harp_ they say to the Almighty_ Depart from us_ Job xxi. 12_ 14. We may_ as Solomon_ prove ourselves_ with mirth_ and judge of the state of our souls by this: How do we stand affected to it? Can we be merry and wise? Can we use it as sauce_ and not as food? But we need not try_ as Solomon did_ whether it will make a happiness for us_ for we may take his word for it_ It is mad; and What does it? Laughter and pleasure (says Sir William Temple) come from very different affections of the mind; for_ as men have no disposition to laugh at things they are most pleased with_ so they are very little pleased with many things they laugh at.,20250223
It does no good: What doeth it? Cui bono—of what use is it? It will not avail to quiet a guilty conscience; no_ nor to ease a sorrowful spirit; nothing is more ungrateful than singing songs to a heavy heart. It will not satisfy the soul_ nor ever yield it true content. It is but a palliative cure to the grievances of this present time. Great laughter commonly ends in a sigh.,20250223
It doth not come of course_ at certain seasons of the year_ as natural productions do_ by a chain of second causes. The proportion between prosperity and adversity is not so exactly observed by Providence as that between day and night_ summer and winter_ but according to the will and counsel of God_ when and as he thinks fit. Some read it_ Sin comes not forth out of the dust_ nor iniquity of the ground. If men be bad_ they must not lay the blame upon the soil_ the climate_ or the stars_ but on themselves. If thou scornest_ thou alone shalt bear it. We must not attribute our afflictions to fortune_ for they are from God_ nor our sins to fate_ for they are from ourselves; so that_ whatever trouble we are in_ we must own that God sends it upon us and we procure it to ourselves: the former is a reason why we should be very patient_ the latter why we should be very penitent_ when we are afflicted.,20250223
It emboldens a man against his adversaries_ their attempts and their scorn: The boldness of his face shall be doubled by wisdom; it will add very much to his courage in maintaining his integrity when he not only has an honest cause to plead_ but by his wisdom knows how to manage it and where to find the interpretation of a thing. He shall not be ashamed_ but shall speak with his enemy in the gate.,20250223
It entails a blessing upon posterity. The children of those that by faith make God their confidence shall be encouraged by the promise that God will be a God to believers and to their seed to flee to him as their refuge_ and they shall find shelter in him. The children of religious parents often do the better for their parents' instructions and example and fare the better for their faith and prayers. __Our fathers trusted in thee_ therefore we will.__ 3. It is an over-flowing ever-flowing spring of comfort and joy; it is a fountain of life_ yielding constant pleasure and satisfaction to the soul_ joys that are pure and fresh_ are life to the soul_ and quench its thirst_ and can never be drawn dry; it is a well of living water_ that is springing up to_ and is the earnest of_ eternal life,20250223
It exposes men to shame. They get a bad name by it_ and every one calls them proud and haughty scorners_ and therefore nobody cares for having any thing to do with them. If men would but consult their reputation a little and the credit of their profession_ which suffers with it_ they would not indulge their pride and passion as they do.,20250223
It exposes the adulterer to the rage of the jealous husband_ whose honour he puts such an affront upon_ v. 34_ 35. He that touches his neighbour's wife_ and is familiar with her_ gives him occasion for jealousy_ much more he that debauches her_ which_ if kept ever so secret_ might then be discovered by the waters of jealousy_ Num. v,20250223
It gives men good hearts_ v,20250223
It goes upwards to be judged and determined to an unchangeable state. It is certain that the spirit of the beast goes downwards to the earth; it dies with the body; it perishes and is gone at death. The soul of a beast is_ at death_ like a candle blown out—there is an end of it; whereas the soul of a man is then like a candle taken out of a dark lantern_ which leaves the lantern useless indeed_ but does itself shine brighter. This great difference there is between the spirits of men and beasts; and a good reason it is why men should set their affections on things above_ and lift up their souls to those things_ not suffering them_ as if they were the souls of brutes_ to cleave to this earth. But who knows this difference? We cannot see the ascent of the one and the descent of the other with our bodily eyes; and therefore those that live by sense_ as all carnal sensualists do_ that walk in the sight of their eyes and will not admit any other discoveries_ by their own rule of judgment have no preëminence above the beasts. Who knows_ that is_ who considers this? Isa. liii. 1. Very few. Were it better considered_ the world would be every way better; but most men live as if they were to be here always_ or as if when they die there were an end of them; and it is not strange that those live like beasts who think they shall die like beasts_ but on such the noble faculties of reason are perfectly lost and thrown away.,20250223
It grows up out of the mire and water. The hypocrite cannot gain his hope without some false rotten ground or other out of which to raise it_ and with which to support it and keep it alive_ any more than the rush can grow without mire. He grounds it on his worldly prosperity_ the plausible profession he makes of religion_ the good opinion of his neighbours_ and his own good conceit of himself_ which are no solid foundation on which to build his confidence. It is all but mire and water; and the hope that grows out of it is but rush and flag. ,20250223
It has a great influence upon public affairs and the well-governing of all societies_ v,20250223
It has been a great trouble to us to see such a holy man as Job was so fretful_ and peevish_ and uneasy to himself_ and especially to hear him quarrel with God and speak indecently to him; but_ though he thus fall_ he is not utterly cast down_ for here he recovers his temper_ comes to himself and to his right mind again by repentance_ is sorry for what he has said amiss_ unsays it_ and humbles himself before God_ ver. 1-6.,20250223
It has been likewise a great trouble to us to see Job and his friends so much at variance_ not only differing in their opinions_ but giving one another a great many hard words_ and passing severe censures one upon another_ though they were all very wise and good men; but here we have this grievance redressed likewise_ the differences between them happily adjusted_ the quarrel taken up_ all the peevish reflections they had cast upon one another forgiven and forgotten_ and all joining in sacrifices and prayers_ mutually accepted of God_ ver. 7-9.,20250223
It has been observed concerning those who have pretended to search for the philosophers' stone that_ though they could never find what they sought for_ yet in the search they have hit upon many other useful discoveries and experiments. Thus Solomon_ when_ in the close of the foregoing chapter_ he applied his heart to know the work of God_ and took a great deal of pains to search into it_ though he despaired of finding it out_ yet he found out that which abundantly recompensed him for the search_ and gave him some satisfaction_ which he here gives us; for therefore he considered all this in his heart_ and weighed it deliberately_ that he might declare it for the good of others. Note_ What we are to declare we should first consider; think twice before we speak once; and what we have considered we should then declare. I believed_ therefore have I spoken.,20250223
It has no other father. He produces it by his power; he governs and directs it_ and makes what use he pleases of it. Even the small drops of the dew he distils upon the earth_ as the God of nature; and_ as the God of grace_ he rains righteousness upon us and is himself as the dew unto Israel. See Hos. xiv. 5_ 6; Mic. v. 7.,20250223
It has reason and equity on its side (v. 11): __I have taught thee in the way of wisdom_ and so it will be found to be at last. I have led thee_ not in the crooked ways of carnal policy_ which does wrong under colour of wisdom_ but in right paths_ agreeable to the eternal rules and reasons of good and evil.__ The rectitude of the divine nature appears in the rectitude of all the divine laws. Observe_ David not only taught his son by good instructions_ but led him both by a good example and by applying general instructions to particular cases; so that nothing was wanting on his part to make him wise. ,20250223
It has troubled us to see a man of such eminent piety and usefulness as Job was so grievously afflicted_ so pained_ so sick_ so poor_ so reproached_ so slighted_ and made the very centre of all the calamities of human life; but here we have this grievance redressed too_ Job healed of all his ailments_ more honoured and beloved than ever_ enriched with an estate double to what he had before_ surrounded with all the comforts of life_ and as great an instance of prosperity as ever he had been of affliction and patience_ ver. 10-17. All this is written for our learning_ that we_ under these and the like discouragements that we meet with_ through patience and comfort of this scripture may have hope.,20250223
It hides its head also for fear_ knowing that jealousy is the rage of a husband_ who will not spare in the day of vengeance_ Prov. vi. 24_ 25. See what pains those take that make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts of it_ pains to compass_ and then to conceal_ that provision which_ after all_ will be death and hell at last. Less pains would serve to mortify and crucify the flesh_ which would be life and heaven at last. Let the sinner change his heart_ and then he needs not disguise his face_ but may lift it up without spot,20250223
It is God only that tries the hearts. Men may try their silver and gold with the fining-pot and the furnace_ but they have no such way of trying one another's hearts; God only does that_ who is both the searcher and the sovereign of the heart.,20250223
It is God that has appointed the day-spring to visit the earth_ and diffuses the morning light through the air_ which receives it as readily as the clay does the seal (v. immediately admitting the impressions of it_ so as of a sudden to be all over enlightened by it_ as the seal stamps its image on the wax; and they stand as a garment_ or as if they were clothed with a garment. The earth puts on a new face every morning_ and dresses itself as we do_ puts on light as a garment_ and is then to be seen,20250223
It is God's commandment and his law. But_ ,20250223
It is God's glory that he cannot himself be found out by searching_ and some of that honour is devolved upon kings_ wise kings_ that search out matters; their hearts are unsearchable_ like the height of heaven or the depth of the earth_ which we may guess at_ but cannot measure. Princes have their arcana imperii—state secrets_ designs which are kept private_ and reasons of state_ which private persons are not competent judges of_ and therefore ought not to pry into. Wise princes_ when they search into a matter_ have reaches which one would not think of_ as Solomon_ when he called of a sword to divide the living child with_ designing thereby to discover the true mother.,20250223
It is God's glory that he needs not search into a matter_ because he knows it without search; but it is the honour of kings_ with a close application of mind_ and by all the methods of enquiry_ to search out the matters that are brought before them_ to take pains in examining offenders_ that they may discover their designs and bring to light the hidden works of darkness_ not to give judgment hastily or till they have weighed things_ nor to leave it wholly to others to examine things_ but to see with their own eyes. ,20250223
It is Solomon's bed_ whose name signifies peace_ because in his days Judah and Israel dwelt safely under their vines and fig-trees. That which she admires his bed for is the guard that surrounded it. Those that rest in Christ not only dwell at ease (many do so who yet are in the greatest danger) but they dwell in safety. Their holy serenity is under the protection of a holy security. This bed had threescore valiant men about it_ as yeomen of the guard_ or the band of gentlemen-pensioners; they are of the valiant of Israel_ and a great many bold and brave men David's reign had produced. The life-guard men are well armed: They all hold swords_ and know how to hold them; they are expert in war_ well skilled in all the arts of it. They are posted about the bed at a convenient distance. They are in a posture of defence_ every man with his sword upon his thigh and his hand upon his sword_ ready to draw upon the first alarm_ and this because of fear in the night_ because of the danger feared; for the lives of princes_ even the wisest and best_ as they are more precious_ so they are more exposed_ and require to be more guarded than the lives of common persons. Or_ because of the fear of it_ and the apprehension which the spouse may have of danger_ these guards are set for her satisfaction_ that she may be quiet from the fear of evil_ which believers themselves are subject to_ especially in the night_ when they are under a cloud as to their spiritual state_ or in any outward trouble more than ordinary. Christ himself was under the special protection of his Father in his whole undertaking. In the shadow of his hand he hid me (Isa. xlix. 2); he had legions of angels at his command. The church is well guarded; more are with her than against her. Lest any hurt this vineyard_ God himself keeps it night and day (Isa. xxvii. 2_ 3); particular believers_ when they repose themselves in Christ and with him_ though it may be night-time with them_ and they may have their fears in the night_ and yet safe_ as safe as Solomon himself in the midst of his guards; the angels have a charge concerning them_ ministers are appointed to watch for their souls_ and they ought to be valiant men_ expert in the spiritual warfare_ holding the sword of the Spirit_ which is the word of God_ and having that girt upon their thigh_ always ready to them for the silencing of the fears of God's people in the night. All the attributes of God are engaged for the safety of believers; they are kept as in a strong-hold by his power (1 Pet. i. are safe in his name (Prov. xviii. his peace protects those in whom it rules (Phil. iv. and the effect of righteousness in them is quietness and assurance_ Isa. xxxii,20250223
It is a cloud coming betwixt_ v. 32; ch. xxvi,20250223
It is a common principle_ Every one for himself. Proximus egomet mihi—None so near to me as myself. Now_ if this be rightly understood_ it will be a reason for the cherishing of gracious dispositions in ourselves and the crucifying of corrupt ones. We are friends or enemies to ourselves_ even in respect of present comfort_ according as we are or are not governed by religious principles.,20250223
It is a debt owing_ not to nature_ but to God's justice. After death the judgment_ and that is a day of wrath_ Rev. vi. 17,20250223
It is a desirable thing to know_ not only the words of truth_ but the certainty of them_ that our faith may be intelligent and rational_ and may grow up to a full assurance. ,20250223
It is a discovering light. By the help of reason we come to know men_ to judge of their characters_ and dive into their designs; by the help of conscience we come to know ourselves. The spirit of a man has a self-consciousness (1 Cor. ii. 11); it searches into the dispositions and affections of the soul_ praises what is good_ condemns what is otherwise_ and judges of the thoughts and intents of the heart. This is the office_ this the power_ of conscience_ which we are therefore concerned to get rightly informed and to keep void of offence.,20250223
It is a fixed state_ whence we shall not return ever again to live such a life as we now live_ ch. vii,20250223
It is a fundamental error in the administration of justice_ and that which cannot but lead men to abundance of transgression_ to consider the parties concerned more than the merits of the cause_ so as to favour one because he is a gentleman_ a scholar_ my countryman_ my old acquaintance_ has formerly done me a kindness_ or may do me one_ or is of my party and persuasion_ and to bear hard on the other party because he is a stranger_ a poor man_ has done me an ill turn_ is or has been my rival_ or is not of my mind_ or has voted against me. Judgment is perverted when any consideration of this kind is admitted into the scale_ any thing but pure right,20250223
It is a great affront to God and a great injury to themselves_ therefore a great evil; it is a vain thing to rise up early and sit up late in pursuit of this world's goods_ which were never designed to be our chief good.,20250223
It is a great cordial. The presence of Christ by his Spirit with him people shall be reviving and refreshing to them_ as that strong wine which makes the lips even of those that are asleep (that are ready to faint away in a deliquium)_ to speak. Unconverted sinners are asleep; saints are often drowsy_ and listless_ and half asleep; but the word and Spirit of Christ will put life and vigour into the soul_ and out of the abundance of the heart that is thus filledthe mouth will speak. When the apostles were filled with the Spirit they spoke with tongues the wonderful works of God (Acts ii. 10_ 12); and those who in opposition to being drunk with wine_ wherein is excess_ are filled with the Spirit_ speak to themselves in psalms and hymns_ Eph. v. 18_ 19. When Christ is thus commending the sweetness of his spouse's love_ excited by the manifestation of his_ she seems to put in that word_ for my beloved_ as in a parenthesis. __Is there any thing in me that is pleasant or valuable? As it is from_ so it is for my beloved.__ Then he delights in our good affections and services_ when they are all for him and devoted to his glory.,20250223
It is a great folly to be extravagant in praising even the best of our friends and benefactors. It is our duty to give every one his due praise_ to applaud those who excel in knowledge_ virtue_ and usefulness_ and to acknowledge the kindnesses we have received with thankfulness; but to do this with a loud voice_ rising early in the morning_ to be always harping on this string_ in all companies_ even to our friend's face_ or so as that he may be sure to hear it_ to do it studiously_ as we do that which we rise early to_ to magnify the merits of our friend above measure and with hyperboles_ is fulsome_ and nauseous_ and savours of hypocrisy and design. Praising men for what they have done is only to get more out of them; and every body concludes the parasite hopes to be well paid for his panegyric or epistle dedicatory. We must not give that praise to our friend which is due to God only_ as some think is intimated in rising early to do it; for in the morning God is to be praised. We must not make too much haste to praise men (so some understand it)_ not cry up men too soon for their abilities and performances_ but let them first be proved; lest they be lifted up with pride_ and laid to sleep in idleness,20250223
It is a great mercy to have a good education_ and to know the things of God by the instructions of his word and ministers. Faith comes by hearing_ and then it is most likely to come when we hear attentively and with the hearing of the ear. ,20250223
It is a great mercy_ ,20250223
It is a great sin in any_ especially in rulers_ to hearken to lies; for thereby they not only give a wrong judgment themselves of persons and things_ according to the lies they give credit to_ but they encourage others to give wrong informations. Lies will be told to those that will hearken to them; but the receiver_ in this case_ is as bad as the thief,20250223
It is a greater folly to be fond of being ourselves extravagantly praised. A wise man rather counts it a curse_ and a reflection upon him_ not only designed to pick his pocket_ but which may really turn to his prejudice. Modest praises (as a great man observes) invite such as are present to add to the commendation_ but immodest immoderate praises tempt them to detract rather_ and to censure one that they hear over-commended. And_ besides_ over-praising a man makes him the object of envy; every man puts in for a share of reputation_ and therefore reckons himself injured if another monopolize it or have more given him than his share. And the greatest danger of all is that it is a temptation to pride; men are apt to think of themselves above what is meet when others speak of them above what is meet. See how careful blessed Paul was not to be over-valued_ 2 Cor. xii. 6.,20250223
It is a grievance that there is no concealing. A wise man would hide it if he could_ for the sake both of his own and his wife's reputation_ but he cannot_ any more than he can conceal the noise of the wind when it blows or the smell of a strong perfume. Those that are froward and brawling will proclaim their own shame_ even when their friends_ in kindness to them_ would cover it.,20250223
It is a growing light; it shines more and more_ not like the light of a meteor_ which soon disappears_ or that of a candle_ which burns dim and burns down_ but like that of the rising sun_ which goes forward shining_ mounts upward shining. Grace_ the guide of this way_ is growing; he that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger. That joy which is the pleasure of this way_ that honour which is the brightness of it_ and all that happiness which is indeed its light_ shall be still increasing. ,20250223
It is a man's honour to mean honestly_ and to have his thoughts right_ though a word or action may be misplaced_ or mistimed_ or at least misinterpreted. But it is a man's shame to lie always at catch_ to act with deceit_ with trick and design_ not only with a long reach_ but with an overreach.,20250223
It is a matter of wonder that God should give Satan such a permission as this_ should deliver the soul of his turtle-dove into the hand of the adversary_ such a lamb to such a lion; but he did it for his own glory_ the honour of Job_ the explanation of Providence_ and the encouragement of his afflicted people in all ages_ to make a case which_ being adjudged_ might be a useful precedent. He suffered Job to be tried_ as he suffered Peter to be sifted_ but took care that his faith should not fail (Luke xxii. 32) and then the trial of it was found unto praise_ and honour_ and glory_ 1 Pet. i,20250223
It is a melancholy __But now__ which this chapter begins with. Adversity is here described as much to the life as prosperity was in the foregoing chapter_ and the height of that did but increase the depth of this. God sets the one over-against the other_ and so did Job_ that his afflictions might appear the more grievous_ and consequently his case the more pitiable.,20250223
It is a mercy to have candle-light to supply the want of day-light_ and a duty_ having that advantage_ to improve it. We say of an elaborate piece_ It smells of the lamp. ,20250223
It is a more valuable gift than house and riches_ contributes more to the comfort and credit of a man's life and the welfare of his family_ is a greater token of God's favour_ and about which the divine providence is in a more especial manner conversant. A good estate may be the inheritance of fathers_ which_ by the common direction of Providence_ comes in course to a man; but no man has a good wife by descent or entail. Parents that are worldly_ in disposing of their children_ look no further than to match them to house and riches_ but_ if withal it be to a prudent wife_ let God have the glory.,20250223
It is a necessary piece of after-wit_ if we have foolishly entangled ourselves_ to get out of the snare as fast as we can_ to lose no time_ spare no pains_ and stick at no submission to make ourselves safe and easy_ and get our affairs into a good posture. It is better to humble ourselves for an accommodation than to ruin ourselves by our stiffness and haughtiness. Make sure thy friend by getting clear from thy engagements from him; for rash suretiship is as much the bane of friendship as that which is prudent is sometimes the bond of it. Let us take heed lest we any way make ourselves guilty of other men's sins against God (1 Tim. v.,20250223
It is a piece of weakness to be very open: He is a fool who utters all his mind_—who tells every thing he knows_ and has in his mouth instantly whatever he has in his thoughts_ and can keep no counsel_—who_ whatever is started in discourse_ quickly shoots his bolt_—who_ when he is provoked_ will say any thing that comes uppermost_ whoever is reflected upon by it_—who_ when he is to speak of any business_ will say all he thinks_ and yet never thinks he says enough_ whether choice or refuse_ corn or chaff_ pertinent or impertinent_ you shall have it all,20250223
It is a piece of wisdom to be upon the reserve: A wise man will not utter all his mind at once_ but will take time for a second thought_ or reserve the present thought for a fitter time_ when it will be more pertinent and likely to answer his intention; he will not deliver himself in a continued speech_ or starched discourse_ but with pauses_ that he may hear what is to be objected and answer it. Non minus interdum oratorium est tacere quam dicere—True oratory requires an occasional pause. Plin. Ep.,20250223
It is a piece of wisdom to keep out of debt as much as may be_ especially to dread suretiship. There may be a just occasion for a man to pass his word for his friend in his absence_ till he come to engage himself; but to be surety in the presence of his friend_ when he is upon the spot_ supposes that his own word will not be taken_ he being deemed insolvent or dishonest_ and then who can with safety pass his word for him? 2. Those that are void of understanding are commonly taken in this snare_ to the prejudice of their families_ and therefore ought not to be trusted too far with their own affairs_ but to be under direction.,20250223
It is a pity but that every one who sues sub formâ pauperis—as a pauper_ should have an honest cause (they are of all others inexcusable if they have not)_ because the scripture has so well provided that it should have a fair hearing_ and that the judge himself should be of counsel_ as for the prisoner_ so for the pauper. 1. It is here made the character of a righteous judge that he considers the cause of the poor. It is every man's duty to consider the poor (Ps. xli. 1)_ but the judgment of the poor is to be considered by those that sit in judgment; they must take as much pains to find out the right in a poor man's cause as in a rich man's. Sense of justice must make both judge and advocate as solicitous and industrious in the poor man's cause as if they hoped for the greatest advantage,20250223
It is a pleasure and satisfaction to good men both to see justice administered by the government they live under_ right taking place and iniquity suppressed_ and also to practise it themselves_ according as their sphere is. They no only do justice_ but do it with pleasure_ not only for fear of shame_ but for love of virtue,20250223
It is a shining light. Their way shines to themselves in the joy and comfort of it; it shines before others in the lustre and honour of it; it shines before men_ who see their good works_ Matt. v,20250223
It is a sin from which few recover themselves when once they are entangled in it. It is like a deep ditch and a narrow pit_ which it is almost impossible to get out of; and therefore it is wisdom to keep far enough from the brink of it. Take heed of making any approaches towards this sin_ because it is so hard to make a retreat from it_ conscience_ which should head the retreat_ being debauched by it_ and divine grace forfeited.,20250223
It is a sin that contributes more than any other to the spreading of vice and immorality in a kingdom: It increases the transgressors among men. One adulteress may be the ruin of many a precious soul and may help to debauch a whole town. It increases the treacherous or perfidious ones; it not only occasions husbands to be false to their wives and servants to their masters_ but many that have professed religion to throw off their profession and break their covenants with God. Houses of uncleanness are therefore such pest-houses as ought to be suppressed by those whose office it is to take care of the public welfare.,20250223
It is a sin that impoverishes men_ wastes their estates_ and reduces them to beggary (v. 26): By means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread; many a man has been so_ who has purchased the ruin of his body and soul at the expense of his wealth. The prodigal son spent his living on harlots_ so that he brought himself to be fellow-commoner with the swine. And that poverty must needs lie heavily which men bring themselves into by their own folly_ Job xxxi. 12.,20250223
It is a sin that incurs divine vengeance_,20250223
It is a sin which bewitches men to their ruin: The adulteress lies in wait as a robber_ pretending friendship_ but designing the greatest mischief_ to rob them of all they have that is valuable_ to strip them both of their armour and of their ornaments. Even those who_ being virtuously educated_ endeavour to shun the adulteress_ she will lie in wait for_ that she may assault them when they are off their guard and she has them at an advantage. Let none therefore be at any time secure. ,20250223
It is a sin which_ if it be not forsaken_ men cannot possibly escape the punishment of; it will unavoidably be their ruin. As their own iniquities do arrest them in the reproaches of conscience and present rebukes (Jer. vii. so their own iniquities shall arrest them and bind them over to the judgments of God. There needs no prison_ no chains; they shall be holden in the cords of their own sins_ as the fallen angels_ being incurably wicked_ are thereby reserved in chains of darkness. The sinner_ who_ having been often reproved_ hardens his neck_ shall die at length without instruction. Having had general warnings sufficient given him already_ he shall have no particular warnings_ but he shall die without seeing his danger beforehand_ shall die because he would not receive instruction_ but in the greatness of his folly would go astray; and so shall his doom be_ he shall never find the way home again. Those that are so foolish as to choose the way of sin are justly left of God to themselves to go in it till they come to that destruction which it leads to_ which is a good reason why we should guard with watchfulness and resolution against the allurements of the sensual appetite.,20250223
It is a sovereign antidote against sin and temptation. Those that have a true relish of the pleasures of serious godliness will not be allured by the baits of sin to swallow its hook; they know where to obtain better things than any it can pretend to offer_ and therefore it is easy to them to depart from the snares of death and to keep their foot from being taken in them.,20250223
It is a terror to wicked men to see the laws put in execution against vice and profaneness. It is destruction to them; as it is also a vexation to them to be forced_ either for the support of their credit or for fear of punishment_ to do judgment themselves. Or_ if we take it as we read it_ the meaning is_ There is true pleasure in the practice of religion_ but certain destruction at the end of all vicious courses.,20250223
It is a token of his favour that_ notwithstanding the distance and quarrel between us and him_ yet he is pleased to speak to us. It is an evidence of his gracious design that he is pleased to speak to us of our own concerns_ to show us what is our duty and what our interest_ what he requires of us and what we may expect from him_ to tell us of our faults and warn us of our danger_ to show us the way and to lead us in it. This he does once_ yea_ twice_ that is_ again and again; when one warning is neglected he gives another_ not willing that any should perish. Precept must be upon precept_ and line upon line; it is so_ that sinners may be left inexcusable,20250223
It is a truth which none can deny or call in question; it is what we may take for granted and are all agreed in_ That God will not do wickedly,20250223
It is a very desirable thing to have our thoughts established_ and not tossed_ and put into a hurry_ by disquieting cares and fears_—to go on in an even steady course of honesty and piety_ not disturbed_ or put out of frame_ by any event or change_—to be satisfied that all shall work for good and issue well at last_ and therefore to be always easy and sedate,20250223
It is a very happy thing when children prove the comfort of their parents. Good children are so; they give them rest_ make them easy_ and free from the many cares they have had concerning them; yea_ they give delight unto their souls. It is a pleasure to parents_ which none know but those that are blessed with it_ to see the happy fruit of the good education they have given their children_ and to have a prospect of their well-doing for both worlds; it gives delight proportionable to the many thoughts of heart that have been concerning them,20250223
It is a very melancholy state; so it appears to us. Holy souls_ at death_ remove to a land of light_ where there is no death; but their bodies they leave to a land of darkness and the shadow of death. He heaps up expressions here of the same import to show that he has as dreadful apprehensions of death and the grave as other men naturally have_ so that it was only the extreme misery he was in that made him wish for it. Come and let us look a little into the grave_ and we shall find_ First_ That there is no order there: it is without any order_ perpetual night_ and no succession of day. All there lie on the same level_ and there is no distinction between prince and peasant_ but the servant is there free from his master_ ch. iii,20250223
It is a very reasonable allowance to be made to all we converse with_ all we contend with_ that they are rational creatures as well as we.,20250223
It is all the same over and over (v. 14): A fool also is full of words_ a passionate fool especially_ that runs on endlessly and never knows when to leave off. He will have the last word_ though it be but the same with that which was the first. What is wanting in the weight and strength of his words he endeavours in vain to make up in the number of them; and they must be repeated_ because otherwise there is nothing in them to make them regarded. Note_ Many who are empty of sense are full of words; and the least solid are the most noisy. The following words may be taken either_ ,20250223
It is allowed that strong men retain riches_ that those who bustle in the world_ who are men of spirit and interest_ and are able to make their part good against all who stand in their way_ are likely to keep what they have and to get more_ while those who are weak are preyed upon by all about them,20250223
It is also to be looked upon as an act of God's mercy to the world of mankind and an instance of his patience towards that provoking grace. Though he could easily cover the earth again with the waters of the sea (and_ methinks_ every flowing tide twice a day threatens us_ and shows what the sea could do_ and would do_ if God would give it leave)_ yet he restrains them_ being not willing that any should perish_ and having reserved the world that now is unto fire_ 2 Pet.,20250223
It is an honour to children to have wise and godly parents_ and to have them continued to them even after they have themselves grown up and settled in the world. Those are unnatural children who reckon their aged parents a burden to them_ and think they live too long; whereas_ if the children be wise and good_ it is as much their honour as can be that thereby they are comforts to their parents in the unpleasant days of their old age.,20250223
It is an imprudent thing in a master to be too fond of a servant_ to advance him too fast_ and admit him to be too familiar with him_ to suffer him to be over-nice and curious in his diet_ and clothing_ and lodging_ and so to bring him up delicately_ because he is a favourite_ and an agreeable servant; it should be remembered that he is a servant_ and_ by being thus indulged_ will be spoiled for any other place. Servants must endure hardness,20250223
It is an instance of the vanity of the world that we are liable to the greatest grief in those things wherein we promise ourselves the greatest comfort. It is as it proves. What greater temporal comfort can a man have than a good wife and good children? Yet,20250223
It is an understanding spirit. It is able to discover and receive truth_ to discourse and reason upon it_ and to direct and rule accordingly. ,20250223
It is an ungrateful thing in a servant_ but what is very common_ to behave insolently because he has been used tenderly. The humble prodigal thinks himself unworthy to be called a son_ and is content to be a servant; the pampered slave thinks himself too good to be called a servant_ and will be a son at the length_ will take his ease and liberty_ will be on a par with his master_ and perhaps pretend to the inheritance. Let masters give their servants that which is equal and fit for them_ and neither more nor less. This is very applicable to the body_ which is a servant to the soul; those that delicately bring up the body_ that humour it_ and are over-tender of it_ will find that at length it will forget its place_ and become a son_ a master_ a perfect tyrant.,20250223
It is applicable to the recovery of a gracious soul out of a state of desertion and despondency. ,20250223
It is as certain that he does not derive his power from any_ nor is it a dispensation that is committed to him_ but his power is original_ and_ like his being_ of himself; and therefore_ if he were not perfectly just_ all the world and the affairs of it would soon be in the utmost confusion. The highest powers on earth have a God above them_ to whom they are accountable_ because it is not far from them to do iniquity. But therefore God has none above him_ because it is not possible that he should do any thing (such is the perfection of his nature) that should need to be controlled. And_ if he be an absolute sovereign_ we are bound to submit to him_ for there is no higher power to which we may appeal_ so that the virtue is a necessity.,20250223
It is as that which is not_ which will give a man no solid satisfaction. It is cheap_ it is common_ yet_ in their account_ it is precious_ and therefore they will hazard their lives_ and perhaps their souls_ in pursuit of it. It is the ruining mistake of thousands that they over-value the wealth of this world and look on it as precious substance. ,20250223
It is better to have no company than bad company. The wife of thy covenant is thy companion_ and yet_ if she be peevish and provoking_ it is better to dwell in a solitary wilderness_ exposed to wind and weather_ than in company with her. A man may better enjoy God and himself in a wilderness than among quarrelsome relations and neighbours. See v. 9.,20250223
It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise_ than for a man to hear the song of fools. 6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot_ so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.,20250223
It is but a little portion that is heard of him. Clouds and darkness are round about him. We see what he does_ but we know not the reasons. Some refer it to the sins of men; it is his glory to pardon sin_ which is covering it_ not remembering it_ not mentioning it; his forbearance_ which he exercises towards sinners_ is likewise his honour_ in which he seems to keep silence and take no notice of the matter,20250223
It is by the word and prayer that our communion with God is kept up. God speaks to us by his law_ and expects we should hear him and heed him; we speak to him by prayer_ to which we wait for an answer of peace. How reverent and serious should we be_ whenever we are hearing from and speaking to the Lord of glory! 2. If God's word be not regarded by us_ our prayers shall not only not be accepted of God_ but they shall be an abomination to him_ not only our sacrifices_ which were ceremonial appointments_ but even our prayers_ which are moral duties_ and which_ when they are put up by the upright_ are so much his delight. See Isa. i. 11_ 15. The sinner whose prayers God is thus angry at is one who wilfully and obstinately refuses to obey God's commandments_ who will not so much as give them the hearing_ but causes his ear to decline the law_ and refuses when God calls; God will therefore justly refuse him when he calls. See Prov. i. 24_ 28.,20250223
It is certain that the government is his_ and he does according to his will in all the hosts both of heaven and earth; and therefore he is not to be charged with injustice; for shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? Gen. xviii,20250223
It is certain that the spirit of the sons of men at death is ascending; it goes upwards to the Father of spirits_ who made it_ to the world of spirits to which it is allied; it dies not with the body_ but is redeemed from the power of the grave_ Ps. xlix,20250223
It is comfortable dealing with such as understand sense. I speak as to wise men_ who can judge what I say_ 1 Cor. x,20250223
It is common with the people to adore the rising sun: All the living who walk under the sun are with the second child_ are in his interests_ are conversant with him_ and make their court to him more than to the father_ whom they look upon as going off_ and despise because his best days are past. Solomon considered this; he saw this to be the disposition of his own people_ which appeared immediately after his death_ in their complaints of his government and their affectation of a change,20250223
It is dangerous to be caressed and flattered by an enemy_ whose kisses are deceitful We can take no pleasure in them because we can put no confidence in them (Joab's kiss and Judas's were deceitful)_ and therefore we have need to stand upon our guard_ that we be not deluded by them; they are to be deprecated. Some read it: The Lord deliver us from an enemy's kisses_ from lying lips_ and from a deceitful tongue.,20250223
It is destructive to the health_ and shortens men's days: Thy flesh and thy body will be consumed by it_ v,20250223
It is easy to find those that will pretend to be kind and liberal. Many a man will call himself a man of mercy_ will boast what good he has done and what good he designs to do_ or_ at least_ what an affection he has to well-doing. Most men will talk a great deal of their charity_ generosity_ hospitality_ and piety_ will sound a trumpet to themselves_ as the Pharisees_ and what little goodness they have will proclaim it and make a mighty matter of it,20250223
It is easy to make such an excuse as this_ sufficient to avoid the censures of men_ for perhaps they cannot disprove us when we say_ We knew it not_ or_ We forgot; and the temptation to tell a lie for the excusing of a fault is very strong when we know that it is impossible to be disproved_ the truth lying wholly in our own breast_ as when we say_ We thought so and so_ and really designed it_ which no one is conscious of but ourselves. ,20250223
It is especially our wisdom to be cautious in making war. Consider_ and take advice_ whether the war should be begun or no_ whether it be just_ whether it be prudent_ whether we be a match for the enemy_ and able to carry it on when it is too late to retreat (Luke,20250223
It is every man's wisdom to keep out of debt as much as may be_ for it is an incumbrance upon him_ entangles him in the world_ puts him in danger of doing wrong or suffering wrong. The borrower is servant to the lender_ and makes himself very much a slave to this world. Christians therefore_ who are bought with a price_ should not thus_ without need_ make themselves the servants of men_ 1 Cor. vii. 23,20250223
It is explained,20250223
It is expressed here very emphatically; not only_ All is vain_ but in the abstract_ All is vanity; as if vanity were the proprium quarto modo—property in the fourth mode_ of the things of this world_ that which enters into the nature of them. The are not only vanity_ but vanity of vanities_ the vainest vanity_ vanity in the highest degree_ nothing but vanity_ such a vanity as is the cause of a great deal of vanity. And this is redoubled_ because the thing is certain and past dispute_ it is vanity of vanities. This intimates that the wise man had his own heart fully convinced of and much affected with this truth_ and that he was very desirous that others should be convinced of it and affected with it_ as he was_ but that he found the generality of men very loth to believe it and consider it (Job xxxiii. 14); it intimates likewise that we cannot comprehend and express the vanity of this world. But who is it that speaks thus slightly of the world? Is it one that will stand to what he says? Yes_ he puts his name to it—saith the preacher. Is it one that was a competent judge? Yes_ as much as ever any man was. Many speak contemptuously of the world because they are hermits_ and know it not_ or beggars_ and have it not; but Solomon knew it. He had dived into nature's depths (1 Kings iv. and he had it_ more of it perhaps than ever any man had_ his head filled with its notions and his belly with its hidden treasures (Ps. xvii. and he passes this judgment on it. But did he speak as one having authority? Yes_ not only that of a king_ but that of a prophet_ a preacher; he spoke in God's name_ and was divinely inspired to say it. But did he not say it in his haste_ or in a passion_ upon occasion of some particular disappointment? No; he said it deliberately_ said it and proved it_ laid it down as a fundamental principle_ on which he grounded the necessity of being religious. And_ as some think_ one main thing he designed was to show that the everlasting throne and kingdom which God had by Nathan promised to David and his seed must be of another world; for all things in this world are subject to vanity_ and therefore have not in them sufficient to answer the extent of that promise. If Solomon find all to be vanity_ then the kingdom of the Messiah must come_ in which we shall inherit substance.,20250223
It is far better to have a heart to do good and want ability for it than have ability for it and want a heart to it: The desire of a man to be kind_ and charitable_ and generous_ is his kindness_ and shall be so construed; both God and man will accept his good-will_ according to what he has_ and will not expect more. A poor man_ who wishes you well_ but can promise you nothing_ because he has nothing to be kind with_ is better than a liar_ than a rich man who makes you believe he will do mighty things_ but_ when it comes to the setting to_ will do nothing. The character of the men of low degree_ that they are vanity_ from whom nothing is expected_ is better than that of men of high degree_ that they are a lie_ they deceive those whose expectations they raised.,20250223
It is folly to be credulous_ to heed every flying report_ to give ear to every man's story_ though ever so improbable_ to take things upon trust from common fame_ to depend upon every man's profession of friendship and give credit to every one that will promise payment; those are simple who thus believe every word_ forgetting that all men_ in some sense_ are liars in comparison with God_ all whose words we are to believe with an implicit faith_ for he cannot lie,20250223
It is folly to be rash_ as the fool is_ who is forward to talk of things he knows nothing of and undertake that which he is no way fit for_ and so lays open his folly and makes himself ridiculous. He began to build and was not able to finish.,20250223
It is folly to complain of the badness of our own times when we have more reason to complain of the badness of our own hearts (if men's hearts were better_ the times would mend) and when we have more reason to be thankful that they are not worse_ but that even in the worst of times we enjoy many mercies_ which help to make them not only tolerable_ but comfortable. ,20250223
It is folly to cry up the goodness of former times_ so as to derogate from the mercy of God to us in our own times; as if former ages had not the same things to complain of that we have_ or if perhaps_ in some respects_ they had not_ yet as if God had been unjust and unkind to us in casting our lot in an iron age_ compared with the golden ages that went before us; this arises from nothing but fretfulness and discontent_ and an aptness to pick quarrels with God himself. We are not to think there is any universal decay in nature_ or degeneracy in morals. God has been always good_ and men always bad; and if_ in some respects_ the times are now worse than they have been_ perhaps in other respects they are better.,20250223
It is glory begun_ the earnest of it_ Ps.,20250223
It is good for all_ but especially for young people_ to know and consider this_ that they may not_ by the indulgence of their youthful lusts_ treasure up unto themselves wrath against that day of wrath_ the wrath of the Lamb.,20250223
It is good for us often to remember those days of darkness_ that we may not be lifted up with pride_ nor lulled asleep in carnal security_ nor even transported into indecencies by vain mirth. ,20250223
It is good for us to be reproved_ and told of our faults_ by our friends. If true love in the heart has but zeal and courage enough to show itself in dealing plainly with our friends_ and reproving them for what they say and do amiss_ this is really better_ not only than secret hatred (as Lev. xix. but than secret love_ that love to our neighbours which does not show itself in this good fruit_ which compliments them in their sins_ to the prejudice of their souls. Faithful are the reproofs of a friend_ though for the present they are painful as wounds. It is a sign that our friends are faithful indeed if_ in love to our souls_ they will not suffer sin upon us_ nor let us alone in it. The physician's care is to cure the patient's disease_ not to please his palate,20250223
It is good in every thing to act with deliberation_ and to consult with ourselves at least_ and_ in matters of moment_ with our friends_ too_ before we determine_ but especially to ask counsel of God_ and beg direction from him_ and observe the guidance of this eye. This is the way to have both our minds and our purposes established_ and to succeed well in our affairs; whereas what is done hastily and with precipitation is repented of at leisure. Take time_ and you will have done the sooner. Deliberandum est diu_ quod statuendum est semel—A final decision should be preceded by mature deliberation,20250223
It is good to be done under the heaven_ while we are here in this world_ while it is day_ while our doing time lasts. This is our state of work and service; it is in the other world that we must expect the retribution. Thither our works will follow us. ,20250223
It is good to begin betimes with the necessary restraints of children from that which is evil_ before vicious habits are confirmed. The branch is easily bent when it is tender,20250223
It is great folly to entangle ourselves with necessitous people_ and to become bound for their debts_ that are ever and anon taking up money_ and lading_ as we say_ out of one hole into another_ for it is ten to one but_ some time or other_ it will come upon us. A man ought never to be bound as surety for more than he is both able and willing to pay_ and can afford to pay without wronging his family_ in case the principal fail_ for he ought to look upon it as his own debt. Ecclesiasticus viii. 13_ Be not surety above thy power_ for_ if thou be surety_ thou must take care to pay it,20250223
It is healthful to be cheerful. The Lord is for the body_ and has provided for it_ not only meat_ but medicine_ and has here told us that the best medicine is a merry heart_ not a heart addicted to vain_ carnal_ sensual mirth; Solomon himself said of that mirth_ It is not medicine_ but madness; it is not food_ but poison; what doth it? But he means a heart rejoicing in God_ and serving him with gladness_ and then taking the comfort of outward enjoyments and particularly that of pleasant conversation. It is a great mercy that God gives us leave to be cheerful and cause to be cheerful_ especially if by his grace he gives us hearts to be cheerful. This does good to a medicine (so some read it); it will make physic more efficient. Or it does good as a medicine to the body_ making it easy and fit for business. But_ if mirth be a medicine (understand it of diversion and recreation)_ it must be used sparingly_ only when there is occasion_ not turned into food_ and it must be used medicinally_ sub regimine—as a prescribed regimen_ and by rule,20250223
It is here added_ A false balance is not good_ to intimate that it is not only abominable to God_ but unprofitable to the sinner himself; there is really no good to be got by it_ no_ not a good bargain_ for a bargain made by fraud will prove a losing bargain in the end.,20250223
It is here observed to the honour of a good man,20250223
It is here observed_,20250223
It is here promised that as afflictions and troubles recur supports and deliverances shall be graciously repeated_ be it ever so often: In six troubles he shall be ready to deliver thee; yea_ and in seven_ v,20250223
It is here proposed to Job to do it. He had been passionately quarrelling with God and his providence_ casting abroad the rage of his wrath towards heaven_ as if he thought thereby to bring God himself to his mind. __Come___ says God_ __try thy hand first upon proud men_ and thou wilt soon see how little they value the rage of thy wrath; and shall I then regard it_ or be moved by it?__ Job had complained of the prosperity and power of tyrants and oppressors_ and was ready to charge God with mal-administration for suffering it; but he ought not to find fault_ except he could mend. If God_ and he only_ has power enough to humble and bring down proud men_ no doubt he has wisdom enough to know when and how to do it_ and it is not for us to prescribe to him or to teach him how to prescribe to him or to teach him how to govern the world. Unless we had an arm like God we must not think to take his work out of his hands.,20250223
It is here represented as a very lamentable thing_ and a public grievance_ and of ill consequence to many_ like the troubling of a fountain and the corrupting of a spring_ for the righteous to fall down before the wicked_ that is,20250223
It is here said_ and said again_ to the righteous_ that it shall be well with them_ and to the wicked_ Woe to them; and these are set the one over against the other_ for their mutual illustration.,20250223
It is here shown that righteousness_ not only by the divine judgment_ will end in life_ and wickedness in death_ but that righteousness_ in its own nature_ has a direct tendency to life and wickedness to death. 1. True holiness is true happiness; it is a preparative for it_ a pledge and earnest of it. Righteousness inclines_ disposes_ and leads_ the soul to life,20250223
It is here supposed that God can do it and will do it himself_ else he would not have put it thus upon Job. By this God proves himself to be God_ that he resists the proud_ sits Judge upon them_ and is able to bring them to ruin. Observe here_ ,20250223
It is his coronation-day in their souls. Before conversion they were crowning themselves_ but then they begin to crown Christ_ and continue to do so from that day forward. They appointed him their head; they bring every thought into obedience to him; they set up his throne in their hearts_ and cast all their crowns at his feet. ,20250223
It is his life_ his precious life_ that is thus irrecoverably thrown away_ he is perfectly lost to all good; his conscience is debauched; a door is opened to all other vices_ and this will certainly end in his endless damnation. ,20250223
It is implied that many deceive themselves with a conceit that_ if they offer sacrifice_ that will excuse them from doing justice_ and procure them a dispensation for their unrighteousness; and this makes their way seem right_ v,20250223
It is in vain to think of flying from God's justice_ or absconding when his wrath is in pursuit of us. The workers of iniquity may find ways and means to hide themselves from men_ but not from God: He knows their works (v. both what they do and what they design.,20250223
It is inconsistent with the perfection of his nature_ and so it is also with the purity of his will (v. 12): God will not do wickedly_ neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. He neither can nor will do a wrong thing_ nor deal hardly with any man. He will never inflict the evil of punishment but where he finds the evil of sin_ nor in any undue proportion_ for that would be to commit iniquity and do wickedly. If appeals be made to him_ or he be to give a definitive sentence_ he will have an eye to the merits of the cause and not respect the person_ for that were to pervert judgment. He will never either do any man wrong or deny any man right_ but the heavens will shortly declare his righteousness. Because he is God_ and therefore is infinitely perfect and holy_ he can neither do wrong himself nor countenance it in others_ nay more than he can die_ or lie_ or deny himself. Though he be Almighty_ yet he never uses his power_ as mighty men often do_ for the support of injustice. He is Shaddai—God all-sufficient_ and therefore he cannot be tempted with evil (James i. to do an unrighteous thing.,20250223
It is intimated that those who quarrel with God do_ in effect_ go about to teach him how to mend his work. For if we contend with men like ourselves_ as not having done well_ we ought to instruct them how to do better; but is it a thing to be suffered that any man should teach his Maker? He that contends with God is justly looked upon as his enemy; and shall he pretend so far to have prevailed in the contest as to prescribe to him? We are ignorant and short-sighted_ but before him all things are naked and open; we are depending creatures_ but he is the sovereign Creator; and shall we pretend to instruct him? Some read it_ Is it any wisdom to contend with the Almighty? The answer is easy. No; it is the greatest folly in the world. Is it wisdom to contend with him whom it will certainly be our ruin to oppose and unspeakably our interest to submit to? 2. He demands a speedy reply to it: __He that reproaches God let him answer this question to his own conscience_ and answer it thus_ Far be it from me to contend with the Almighty or to instruct him. Let him answer all those questions which I have put_ if he can. Let him answer for his presumption and insolence_ answer it at God's bar_ to his confusion.__ Those have high thoughts of themselves_ and mean thoughts of God_ who reprove any thing he says or does.,20250223
It is joy and true happiness to a man. This is the excellency of knowledge_ divine knowledge_ not only above money_ but above wisdom too_ human wisdom_ the wisdom of this world_ that it gives life to those that have it. The fear of the Lord_ that is wisdom_ and that is life; it prolongs life. Men's wealth exposes their lives_ but their wisdom protects them. Nay_ whereas wealth will not lengthen out the natural life_ true wisdom will give spiritual life_ the earnest of eternal life; so much better is it to get wisdom than gold,20250223
It is known that they are but men; let them put what face they will upon it_ and_ like the king of Tyre_ set their heart as the heart of God_ yet the Egyptians are men_ and not gods_ and it is known that they are so.,20250223
It is lamented that beauty should be so abused as it is by those that have not modesty with it. It seems ill-bestowed upon them; it is quite misplaced_ as a jewel in a swine's snout_ with which he roots in the dunghill. If beauty be not guarded by virtue_ the virtue is exposed by the beauty. It may be applied to all other bodily endowments and accomplishments; it is a pity that those should have them who have not discretion to use them well.,20250223
It is like that wine which is_ ,20250223
It is likely that Satan did think that Job_ if impoverished_ would renounce his religion and so disprove his profession_ and if so (as a learned gentleman has observed in his Mount of Spirits) Satan would have made out his own universal empire among the children of men. God declared Job the best man then living: now_ if Satan can prove him a hypocrite_ it will follow that God had not one faithful servant among men and that there was no such thing as true and sincere piety in the world_ but religion was all a sham_ and Satan was king de facto—in fact_ over all mankind. But it appeared that the Lord knows those that are his and is not deceived in any. ,20250223
It is made light of_ and turned off with a jest_ as only a foolish thing_ but really it is sin_ it is exceedingly sinful; you cannot call it by a worse name than to call it sin. It is bad to do evil_ but it is worse to devise it; for that has in it the subtlety and poison of the old serpent. But it may be taken more generally. We contract guilt_ not only by the act of foolishness_ but by the thought of it_ though it go no further; the first risings of sin in the heart are sin_ offensive to God_ and must be repented of or we are undone. Not only malicious_ unclean_ proud thoughts_ but even foolish thoughts_ are sinful thoughts. If vain thoughts lodge in the heart_ they defile it (Jer. iv. which is a reason why we should keep our hearts with all diligence_ and harbour no thoughts there which cannot give a good account of themselves_ Gen. vi,20250223
It is made the character of a wicked man that because it is a poor man's cause_ which there is nothing to be got by_ he regards not to know it_ in the true state of it_ for he cares not which way it goes_ right or wrong. See Job xxix. 16.,20250223
It is maintained as a paradox to a blind world that an honest_ godly_ poor man_ is better than a wicked_ ungodly_ rich man_ has a better character_ is in a better condition_ has more comfort in himself_ is a greater blessing to the world_ and is worthy of much more honour and respect. It is not only certain that his case will be better at death_ but it is better in life. When Aristides was by a rich man upbraided with his poverty he answered_ Thy riches do thee more hurt than my poverty does me.,20250223
It is maintained that a small estate_ honestly come by_ which a man is content with_ enjoys comfortably_ serves God with cheerfully_ and puts to a right use_ is much better and more valuable than a great estate ill-got_ and then ill-kept or ill-spent. It carries with it more inward satisfaction_ a better reputation with all that are wise and good; it will last longer_ and will turn to a better account in the great day_ when men will be judged_ not according to what they had_ but what they did.,20250223
It is marshalled_ and kept in order and under discipline. It is terrible to its enemies as Israel in the wilderness was_ Exod. xv,20250223
It is meant of the wild beasts_ which_ being wild_ must seek a shelter for themselves_ to which by instinct they are directed_ while the tame beasts_ which are serviceable to man_ are housed and protected by his care_ as Exod. ix,20250223
It is men's folly to neglect their business. Those are void of understanding that do so_ for then they fall in with idle companions and follow them in their evil courses_ and so come to want bread_ at least bread of their own_ and make themselves burdensome to others_ eating the bread out of other people's mouths.,20250223
It is men's wisdom to mind their business and follow an honest calling_ for that is the way_ by the blessing of God_ to get a livelihood: He that tills his land_ of which he is either the owner or the occupant_ that keeps to his word and is willing to take pains_ if he do not raise an estate by it (what need is there of that?)_ yet he shall be satisfied with bread_ shall have food convenient for himself and his family_ enough to bear his charges comfortably through the world. Even the sentence of wrath has this mercy in it_ Thou shalt eat bread_ though it be in the sweat of thy face. Cain was denied this_ Gen. iv,20250223
It is more pleasant to have a good name_ a name for good things with God and good people; this is as precious ointment_ Eccl. vii. 1. It makes the bones fat; it gives a secret pleasure_ and that which is strengthening. It is also very comfortable to hear (as some understand it) a good report concerning others; a good man has no greater joy than to hear that his friends walk in the truth.,20250223
It is necessary to our repentance for sin that we be acquainted with the evil of it_ as it is necessary to the cure of a disease to know its nature_ causes_ and malignity. St. Paul therefore valued the divine law_ because it discovered sin to him_ Rom. vii,20250223
It is no better when it is vented in spiteful and mischievous language: He that utters slander is a fool too_ for God will sooner or later bring forth that righteousness as the light which he endeavours to cloud_ and will find an expedient to roll the reproach away.,20250223
It is no pleasure to him. God has indeed expressed himself in his word well pleased with the righteous; his countenance beholds them and his delight is in them and their prayers; but all that adds nothing to the infinite satisfaction and complacency which the Eternal Mind has in itself. God can enjoy himself without us_ though we could have but little enjoyment of ourselves without our friends. This magnifies his condescension_ in that_ though our services be no real profit or pleasure to him_ yet he invites_ encourages_ and accepts them.,20250223
It is not a fair way of disputing to charge men with those consequences of their opinions which they expressly renounce.,20250223
It is not commanded since our days_ but what it is it was long before we were born_ so that it was neither made by us nor designed primarily for us_ but we take it as we find it and as the many generations had it that went before us. The day-spring knew its place before we knew ours_ for we are but of yesterday,20250223
It is not enough that what we say comes from the heart_ but it must come from a composed heart_ and not from a sudden heat or passion. As the mouth must not be rash_ so the heart must not be hasty; we must not only think_ but think twice_ before we speak_ when we are to speak either from God in preaching or to God in prayer_ and not utter any thing indecent and undigested_ 1 Cor. xiv. 15.,20250223
It is not his wisdom and virtue_ but his worldly wealth or greatness_ that he accounts his excellency_ and values himself upon. We will suppose that to mount up to the heavens_ and_ since his spirit always rises with his condition_ you may suppose that with it his head reaches to the clouds. He is every way advanced; the world has done the utmost it can for him. He looks down upon all about him with disdain_ while they look up to him with admiration_ envy_ or fear. We will suppose him to bid fair for a universal monarchy. And_ though he cannot but have made himself many enemies before he arrived to this pitch of prosperity_ yet he thinks himself as much out of the reach of their darts as if he were in the clouds. ,20250223
It is not in our power to order the motions of the stars_ nor are we entrusted with the guidance of them. God_ who calls the stars by their names (Ps. cxlvii. calls them forth in their respective seasons_ appointing them the time of their rising and setting. But this is not our province; we cannot bring forth Mazzaroth—the stars in the southern signs_ nor guide Arcturus—those in the northern_ v,20250223
It is not like the vineyard of the man void of understanding_ that was all grown over with thorns and nettles; but here are fruits_ pleasant fruits_ all trees of frankincense_ and all the chief spices_ v,20250223
It is not only among the poor country people_ but in the cities also_ that we see the tears of the oppressed (v. 12): Men groan from out of the city_ where the rich merchants and traders are as cruel with their poor debtors as the landlords in the country are with their poor tenants. In cities such cruel actions as these are more observed than in obscure corners of the country and the wronged have easier access to justice to right themselves; and yet the oppressors there fear neither the restraints of the law nor the just censures of their neighbours_ but the oppressed groan and cry out like wounded men_ and can no more ease and help themselves_ for the oppressors are inexorable and deaf to their groans.,20250223
It is not only promised that God will guide the upright_ and threatened that he will destroy the transgressors_ but_ that we may be the more fully assured of both_ it is here represented as if the nature of the thing were such on both sides that it would do it itself. 1. The integrity of an honest man will itself be his guide in the way of duty and the way of safety. His principles are fixed_ his rule is certain_ and therefore his way is plain; his sincerity keeps him steady_ and he needs not tack about every time the wind turns_ having no other end to drive at than to keep a good conscience. Integrity and uprightness will preserve men_ Ps. xxv. 21,20250223
It is not so easy with such excuses to evade the judgment of God; and to the discovery of that we lie open and by the determination of that we must abide. Now_ ,20250223
It is now her comfort_ as it was then_ that he feeds among the lilies_ that he takes delight in his people and converses freely with them_ as we do with those with whom we feed; and therefore_ though at present he be withdrawn_ __I shall meet with him again. I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance_ and my God.__,20250223
It is of great advantage to us throughout the whole course of our passage through this world: By it there is real profit to those that see the sun_ both to those that have it and to their contemporaries. It is pleasant to see the sun (ch. xi. but that pleasure is not comparable to the pleasure of wisdom. The light of this world is an advantage to us in doing the business of this world (John xi. 9); but to those that have that advantage_ unless withal they have wisdom wherewith to manage their business_ that advantage is worth little to them. The clearness of the eye of the understanding is of greater use to us than bodily eye-sight,20250223
It is often the lot of those that fear God to have but a little of this world. The poor receive the gospel_ and poor they still are_ Jam. ii,20250223
It is only in heavenly wisdom that we inherit substance_ Prov. viii,20250223
It is only just men upon earth that are subject thus to sin and infirmity; the spirits of just men_ when they have got clear of the body_ are made perfect in holiness (Heb. xii.,20250223
It is only the prayer of the upright that is the acceptable and prevailing prayer_ Prov. xv,20250223
It is our duty therefore to enquire after him. Where is he_ that we may pay our homage to him_ may own our dependence upon him and obligations to him? Where is he_ that we may apply to him for maintenance and protection_ may receive law from him_ and may seek our happiness in his favour_ from whose power we received our being? ,20250223
It is our great concern to keep our souls from straits_ being entangled in snares and perplexities_ and disquieted with troubles_ that we may preserve the possession and enjoyment of ourselves and that our souls may be in frame for the service of God,20250223
It is our great unhappiness and misery that_ because we cannot foresee an evil_ we know not how to avoid it_ or guard against it_ and_ because we are not aware of the proper successful season of actions_ therefore we lose our opportunities and miss our way: Because to every purpose there is but one way_ one method_ one proper opportunity_ therefore the misery of man is great upon him; because it is so hard to hit that_ and it is a thousand to one but he misses it. Most of the miseries men labour under would have been prevented if they could have been foreseen and the happy time discovered to avoid them. Men are miserable because they are not sufficiently sagacious and attentive,20250223
It is part of the character of a righteous man that being convinced of the account he must give of his words_ and of the good and bad influence of them upon others_ he makes conscience of speaking truly (it is his heart that answers_ that is_ he speaks as he thinks_ and dares not do otherwise_ he speaks the truth in his heart_ Ps. xv. and of speaking pertinently and profitably_ and therefore he studies to answer_ that his speech may be with grace_ Neh. ii. 4; v. 7,20250223
It is part of the duty of the survivors: Let the memory of the just be blessed_ so the Jews read it_ and observe it as a precept_ not naming an eminently just man that is dead without adding_ Let his memory be blessed. We must delight in making an honourable mention of good men that are gone_ bless God for them_ and for his gifts and graces that appeared in them_ and especially be followers of them in that which is good.,20250223
It is plainly declared that living a good life (doing justly and loving mercy) is more pleasing to God than the most pompous and expensive instances of devotion. Sacrifices were of divine institution_ and were acceptable to God if they were offered in faith and with repentance_ otherwise not_ Isa. i. 11_ &c. But even then moral duties were preferred before them (1 Sam. xv.,20250223
It is possible a man may grow poor by meanly sparing what he has_ withholding more than is meet_ not paying just debts_ not relieving the poor_ not providing what is convenient for the family_ not allowing necessary expenses for the preservation of the goods; this tends to poverty; it cramps men's ingenuity and industry_ weakens their interest_ destroys their credit_ and forfeits the blessing of God: and_ let men be ever so saving of what they have_ if God blast it and blow upon it_ it comes to nothing. A fire not blown shall consume it_ Hag. i. 6_ 9.,20250223
It is possible a man may grow rich by prudently spending what he has_ may scatter in works of piety_ charity_ and generosity_ and yet may increase; nay_ by that means may increase_ as the corn is increased by being sown. By cheerfully using what we have our spirits are exhilarated_ and so fitted for the business we have to do_ by minding which closely what we have is increased; it gains a reputation which contributes to the increase. But it is especially to be ascribed to God; he blesses the giving hand_ and so makes it a getting hand_ 2 Cor. ix,20250223
It is possible that an estate may be suddenly raised. There are those that will be rich_ by right or wrong_ who make no conscience of what they say or do if they can but get money by it_ who_ when it is in their power_ will cheat their own father_ and who sordidly spare and hoard up what they get_ grudging themselves and their families food convenient and thinking all lost but what they buy land with or put out to interest. By such ways as these a man may grow rich_ may grow very rich_ in a little time_ at his first setting out,20250223
It is probable that Solomon wrote this when he was himself old_ and could speak feelingly of the infirmities of age_ which perhaps grew the faster upon him for the indulgence he had given himself in sensual pleasures. Some old people bear up better than others under the decays of age_ but_ more or less_ the days of old age are and will be evil days and of little pleasure. Great care therefore should be taken to pay respect and honour to old people_ that they may have something to balance these grievances and nothing may be done to add to them. And all this_ put together_ makes up a good reason why we should remember our Creator in the days of our youth_ that he may remember us with favour when these evil days come_ and his comforts may delight our souls when the delights of sense are in a manner worn off.,20250223
It is probable that they were men of figure in their country-princes_ or heads of houses. Now observe_,20250223
It is quite out of our power to alter this course: __Hast thou countermanded the morning since thy days? Hast thou at any time raised the morning light sooner than its appointed time_ to serve thy purpose when thou hast waited for the morning_ or ordered the day-spring for thy convenience to any other place than its own? No_ never. Why then wilt thou pretend to direct the divine counsels_ or expect to have the methods of Providence altered in favour of thee?__ We may as soon break the covenant of the day and of the night as any part of God's covenant with his people_ and particularly this_ I will chasten them with the rod of men,20250223
It is repeated (v. 10) by way of question_ is there any thing of which it may be said_ with wonder_ See_ this is new; there never was the like? It is an appeal to observing men_ and a challenge to those that cry up modern learning above that of the ancients. Let them name any thing which they take to be new_ and though perhaps we cannot make it to appear_ for want of the records of former times_ yet we have reason to conclude that it has been already of old time_ which was before us. What is there in the kingdom of nature of which we may say_ This is new? The works were finished from the foundation of the world (Heb. iv. 3); things which appear new to us_ as they do to children_ are not so in themselves. The heavens were of old; the earth abides for ever; the powers of nature and the links of natural causes are still the same that ever they were. In the kingdom of Providence_ though the course and method of it have not such known and certain rules as that of nature_ nor does it go always in the same track_ yet_ in the general_ it is still the same thing over and over again. Men's hearts_ and the corruptions of them_ are still the same; their desires_ and pursuits_ and complaints_ are still the same; and what God does in his dealings with men is according to the scripture_ according to the manner_ so that it is all repetition. What is surprising to us needs not be so_ for there has been the like_ the like strange advancements and disappointments_ the like strange revolutions and sudden turns_ sudden turns of affairs; the miseries of human life have always been much the same_ and mankind tread a perpetual round_ and_ as the sun and wind_ are but where they were. Now the design of this is_ ,20250223
It is righteousness only that will deliver from the evil of death. A good conscience will make death easy_ and take off the terror of it; it is the privilege of the righteous only not to be hurt of the second death_ and so not much hurt by the first.,20250223
It is sad to see what intemperate passions even wise and good men are sometimes betrayed into by the heat of disputation_ of which Zophar here is an instance. Eliphaz began with a very modest preface_ ch. iv,20250223
It is satisfying; it will not only fill their hands_ but fill their treasures_ not only maintain them_ but make them rich. The things of this world may fill men's bellies (Ps. xvii. but not their treasures_ for they cannot in them secure to themselves goods for many years; perhaps they may be deprived of them this night. But let the treasures of the soul be ever so capacious there is enough in God_ and Christ_ and heaven_ to fill them. In Wisdom's promises believers have goods laid up_ not for days and years_ but for eternity; her fruit therefore is better than gold.,20250223
It is seldom that they recover themselves_ for it is a deep pit; it will be hard getting out of it_ it so besots the mind and debauches the conscience_ by pleasing the flesh.,20250223
It is so common a thing that nobody heeds it_ nor takes any notice of it: They perish without any regarding it_ or laying it to heart. The deaths of others are much the subject of common talk_ but little the subject of serious thought. Some think the eternal damnation of sinners is here spoken of_ as well as their temporal death: They are destroyed_ or broken to pieces_ by death_ from morning to evening; and_ if they repent not_ they perish for ever (so some read it)_ v,20250223
It is strong as death. The pains of a disappointed lover are like the pains of death; nay_ the pains of death are slighted_ and made nothing of_ in pursuit of the beloved object. Christ's love to us was strong as death_ for it broke through death itself. He loved us_ and gave himself for us. The love of true believers to Christ is strong as death_ for it makes them dead to every thing else; it even parts between soul and body_ while the soul_ upon the wings of devout affections_ soars upward to heaven_ an even forgets that it is yet clothed and clogged with flesh. Paul_ in a rapture of this love_ knew not whether he was in the body or out of the body. By it a believer is crucified to the world. ,20250223
It is substantial; it is substance itself. It is a happiness which will subsist of itself_ and stand alone_ without the accidental supports of outward conveniences. Spiritual and eternal things are the only real and substantial things. Joy in God is substantial joy_ solid and well-grounded. The promises are their bonds_ Christ is their surety_ and both substantial. They inherit substance; that is_ their inheritance hereafter is substantial; it is a weight of glory; it is substance_ Heb. x,20250223
It is such a feast as Ahasuerus made to show the riches of his glorious kingdom. The grace of the gospel is thus set before us in the ordinance of the Lord's supper. To bid her guests welcome,20250223
It is sufficient to say that Job here speaks of what God can do; but_ if we must understand it of what he has done in fact_ all these verses may perhaps be applied to Noah's flood_ when the mountains of the earth were shaken_ and the sun and stars were darkened; and the world that now is we believe to be reserved for that fire which will consume the mountains_ and melt the earth_ with its fervent heat_ and which will turn the sun into darkness.,20250223
It is sufficient_ and therefore we must not add to it (v. 6): Add thou not unto his words_ because they are pure and perfect. This forbids the advancing of any thing_ not only in contradiction to the word of God_ but in competition with it; though it be under the plausible pretence of explaining it_ yet_ if it pretend to be of equal authority with it_ it is adding to his words_ which is not only a reproach to them as insufficient_ but opens a door to all manner of errors and corruptions; for_ that one absurdity being granted_ that the word of any man_ or company of men_ is to be received with the same faith and veneration as the word of God_ a thousand follow. We must be content with what God has thought fit to make known to us of his mind_ and not covet to be wise above what is written; for_ ,20250223
It is supposed that a man may walk in his uprightness and yet be poor in this world_ which is a temptation to dishonesty_ and yet may resist the temptation and continue to walk in his uprightness—also that a man may be perverse in his ways_ injurious to God and man_ and yet be rich_ and prosper in the world_ for a while_ may be rich_ and so lie under great obligations and have great opportunities to do good_ and yet be perverse in his ways and do a great deal of hurt,20250223
It is supposed that an honest good man may have but a little of the wealth of this world (all the righteous are not rich)_—that a man may have but little_ and yet may be honest (though poverty is a temptation to dishonesty_ ch. xxx. 9_ yet not an invincible one)_—and that a man may grow rich_ for a while_ by fraud and oppression_ may have great revenues_ and those got and kept without right_ may have no good title to them nor make any good use of them,20250223
It is taken for granted here that beauty or comeliness of body is as a jewel of gold_ a thing very valuable_ and_ where there is wisdom and grace to guard against the temptations of it_ it is a great ornament_,20250223
It is taken for granted that a gracious woman is as solicitous to preserve her reputation for wisdom and modesty_ humility and courtesy_ and all those other graces that are the true ornaments of her sex_ as strong men are to secure their estates; and those women who are truly gracious will_ in like manner_ effectually secure their honour by their prudence and good conduct. A gracious woman is as honourable as a valiant man and her honour is as sure.,20250223
It is that which recommends us to God_ which beautifies the soul_ which enables us to answer the end of our creation_ to live to some good purpose in the world_ and to get to heaven at last; and therefore it is the principal thing.,20250223
It is the care of the upright to preserve their own souls_ that they be not polluted with sin_ and that by the troubles of the world they may not be put out of the possession of them_ especially that they may not perish for ever_ Matt. xvi,20250223
It is the character of God's people that they fear God_ have an awe of him upon their hearts and make conscience of their duty to him_ and this because they see his eye always upon them and they know it is their concern to approve themselves to him. When they lie at the mercy of proud oppressors they fear God more then they fear them. They do not quarrel with the providence of God_ but submit to it. ,20250223
It is the character of a fool that his heart is in the house of mirth; his heart is all upon it to be merry and jovial; his whole delight is in sport and gaiety_ in merry stories_ merry songs_ and merry company_ merry days and merry nights. If he be at any time in the house of mourning_ he is under a restraint; his heart at the same time is in the house of mirth; this is his folly_ and helps to make him more and more foolish.,20250223
It is the character of a wicked man that he takes pleasure in sin; he has an appetite to the bait_ and swallows it greedily_ and has no dread of the hook_ nor feels from it when he has swallowed it: Folly is joy to him; the folly of others is so_ and his own much more. He sins_ not only without regret_ but with delight_ not only repents not of it_ but makes his boast of it. This is a certain sign of one that is graceless,20250223
It is the character of a wise and good man that he makes conscience of his duty. A fool lives at large_ walks at all adventures_ by no rule_ acts with no sincerity or steadiness; but a man of understanding_ the eyes of whose understanding are enlightened by the Spirit (and those that have not a good understanding have no understanding)_ walks uprightly_ lives a sober_ orderly_ regular life_ and studies in every thing to conform himself to the will of God; and this is a constant pleasure and joy to him. But what foolishness remains in him_ or proceeds from him at any time_ is a grief to him_ and he is ashamed of it. By these characters we may try ourselves.,20250223
It is the character of a wise man that he is very willing to be reproved_ and therefore chooses to converse with those that_ both by their words and example_ will show him what is amiss in him: The ear that can take the reproof will love the reprover. Faithful friendly reproofs are here called the reproofs of life_ not only because they are to be given in a lively manner_ and with a prudent zeal (and we must reprove by our lives as well as by our doctrine)_ but because_ where they are well-taken_ they are means of spiritual life_ and lead to eternal life_ and (as some think) to distinguish them from rebukes and reproaches for well-doing_ which are rather reproofs of death_ which we must not regard nor be influenced by,20250223
It is the character of just men that they do good; for the tree is known by its fruits. ,20250223
It is the day of his espousals_ in which he betroths them to him for ever in lovingkindness and in mercies_ joins them to himself in faith and love_ and gives himself to them in the promises and all he has_ to be theirs. Thou shalt not be for another_ so will I also be for thee_ Hos. iii,20250223
It is the day of the gladness of his heart; he is pleased with the honour that his people do him_ pleased with the progress of his interest among them. Does Satan fall before them? In that hour Jesus rejoices in spirit_ Luke x. 18_ 21. There is joy in heaven over repenting sinners; the family is glad when the prodigal son returns. Go forth and behold Christ's grace toward sinners_ as his crown_ his brightest glory.,20250223
It is the duty and interest of all men to fear God. Men shall fear him (so some); sooner or later they shall fear him. Those that will not fear the Lord and his goodness shall for ever tremble under the pourings out of the vials of his wrath.,20250223
It is the duty of children to study how they may gladden the hearts of their good parents_ and do it yet more and more_ so that they may greatly rejoice in them_ even when the evil days come and the years of which they say they have no pleasure in them but this_ to see their children do well_ as Barzillai to see Chimham preferred,20250223
It is the duty of mothers_ as well as fathers_ to teach their children what is good_ that they may do it_ and what is evil_ that they may avoid it; when they are young and tender they are most under the mother's eye_ and she has then an opportunity of moulding and fashioning their minds well_ which she ought not to let slip,20250223
It is the excellency of the word of God that it teaches us not only divine wisdom for another world_ but human prudence for this world_ that we may order our affairs with discretion; and this is one good rule_ To avoid suretiship_ because by it poverty and ruin are often brought into families_ which take away that comfort in relations which he had recommended in the foregoing chapter. 1. We must look upon suretiship as a snare and decline it accordingly_ v. 1_ 2. __It is dangerous enough for a man to be bound for his friend_ though it be one whose circumstances he is well acquainted with_ and well assured of his sufficiency_ but much more to strike the hands with a stranger_ to become surety for one whom thou dost not know to be either able or honest.__ Or the stranger here with whom the hand is stricken is the creditor_ __the usurer to whom thou art become bound_ and yet as to thee he is a stranger_ that is_ thou owest him nothing_ nor hast had any dealings with him. If thou hast rashly entered into such engagements_ either wheedled into them or in hopes to have the same kindness done for thee another time_ know that thou art snared with the words of thy mouth; it was easily done_ with a word's speaking; it was but setting thy hand to a paper_ a bond is soon sealed and delivered_ and a recognizance entered into. But it will not be so easily got clear of; thou art in a snare more than thou art aware of.__ See how little reason we have to make light of tongue-sins; if by a word of our mouth we may become indebted to men_ and lie open to their actions_ by the words of our mouth we may become obnoxious to God's justice_ and even so may be snared. It is false that words are but wind: they are often snares,20250223
It is the folly of fools that they lay up mischief in their hearts_ which is ready to them in all they say_ and works terror and destruction both to others and to themselves. They love devouring words (Ps. lii. and these come uppermost. Their mouth is near destruction_ having the sharp arrows of bitter words always at hand to throw about.,20250223
It is the folly of some that they covet to make a great figure abroad_ take place_ and take state_ as persons of quality_ and yet want necessaries at home_ and_ if their debts were paid_ would not be worth a morsel of bread_ nay_ perhaps_ pinch their bellies to put it on their backs_ that they may appear very gay_ because fine feathers make fine birds,20250223
It is the happiness of all that fear God_ that in the worst of times it shall be well with them; their happiness in God's favour cannot be prejudiced_ nor their communion with God interrupted_ by their troubles; they are in a good case_ for they are kept in a good frame under their troubles_ and in the end they shall have a blessed deliverance from and an abundant recompence for their troubles. And therefore __surely I know_ I know it by the promise of God_ and the experience of all the saints_ that_ however it goes with others_ it shall go well with them.__ All is well that ends well. ,20250223
It is the happiness of the righteous that they shall have enough and that they know when they have enough. They desire not to be surfeited_ but_ being moderate in their desires_ they are soon satisfied. Nature is content with a little and grace with less; enough is as good as a feast. Those that feed on the bread of life_ that feast on the promises_ meet with abundant satisfaction of soul there_ eat_ and are filled,20250223
It is the heart that must be taken care of and directed aright; the motions and affections of the soul must be towards right objects and under a steady guidance. If the heart be guided in the way_ the steps will be guided and the conversation well ordered.,20250223
It is the inspiration of the Almighty that gives us this understanding spirit; for he is the Father of spirits and fountain of understanding. See Gen. ii. 7; Eccl. xii. 7; Zech.,20250223
It is the main matter_ and that which ought to be the chief and continual care of every man in this life (v. 7): Wisdom is the principal thing; other things which we are solicitous to get and keep are nothing to it. It is the whole of man_ Eccl. xii,20250223
It is the misery of damned sinners that they know they shall never return out of that utter darkness_ nor pass the gulf there fixed. Fifthly_ He perplexes himself with continual care_ especially if Providence ever so little frown upon him_ v,20250223
It is the misery of the wicked that_ through the insatiableness of their own desires_ they are always needy; not only their souls shall not be satisfied with the world and the flesh_ but even their belly shall want; their sensual appetite is always craving. In hell they shall be denied a drop of water.,20250223
It is the opinion of many of the ancients that this history was written by Moses himself in Midian_ and delivered to his suffering brethren in Egypt_ for their support and comfort under their burdens_ and the encouragement of their hope that God would in due time deliver and enrich them_ as he did this patient sufferer. Some conjecture that it was written originally in Arabic_ and afterwards translated into Hebrew_ for the use of the Jewish church_ by Solomon (so Monsieur Jurieu) or some other inspired writer. It seems most probable to me that Elihu was the penman of it_ at least of the discourses_ because (ch. xxxii. 15_ 16) he mingles the words of a historian with those of a disputant: but Moses perhaps wrote the first two chapters and the last_ to give light to the discourses; for in them God is frequently called Jehovah_ but not once in all the discourses_ except ch. xii,20250223
It is the sin_ and will be the ruin_ of a wicked man_ that he speaks wickedly like himself. The mouth of the wicked speaks frowardness_ that which is displeasing to God and provoking to those he converses with; and what is the issue of it? Why_ the froward tongue shall be cut out_ as surely as the flattering one_ Ps. xii. 3.,20250223
It is the time God takes for dealing personally with men. 1. When he sent angels_ extraordinary messengers_ on his errands_ he commonly chose that time for the delivery of their messages_ when by deep sleep falling on men the bodily senses were all locked up and the mind more free to receive the immediate communications of divine light. Thus he made his mind known to the prophets by visions and dreams (Num. xii. 6); thus he warned Abimelech (Gen. xx.,20250223
It is the undoubted character of all true believers that they are Christ's_ and then_ and then only_ he is theirs. They have given their own selves to him (2 Cor. viii. 5); they receive his doctrine and obey his laws; they bear his image and espouse his interest; they belong to Christ. If we be his_ his wholly_ his only_ his for ever_ we may take the comfort of his being ours.,20250223
It is the undoubted character of every honest man that he is truly desirous to have his mistakes rectified_ and to be made to understand wherein he has erred; and he will acknowledge that right words_ when they appear to him to be so_ though contrary to his former sentiments_ are both forcible and acceptable.,20250223
It is the unspeakable privilege of true believers that Christ is theirs: My beloved is mine; this denotes not only propriety (__I have a title to him__) but possession and tenure—__I receive from his fulness.__ Believers are partakers of Christ; they have not only an interest in him_ but the enjoyment of him_ are taken not only in the covenant_ but into communion with him. All the benefits of his glorious undertaking_ as Mediator_ are made over to them. He is that to them which the world neither is nor can be_ all that which they need and desire_ and which will make a complete happiness for them. All he is is theirs_ and all he has_ all he has done_ and all he is doing; all he has promised in the gospel_ all he has prepared in heaven_ all is yours. ,20250223
It is the way of the upright to avoid sin_ and every thing that looks like it and leads towards it; and this is a highway marked out by authority_ tracked by many that have gone before us_ and in which we meet with many that keep company with us; it is easy to find and safe to be travelled in_ like a highway_ Isa. xxxv,20250223
It is the way to be long-lived. God's commandments shall add to us length of days; to a good useful life on earth_ they shall add an eternal life in heaven_ length of days for ever and ever_ Ps. xxi,20250223
It is the wisdom of the wise that they treasure up a stock of useful knowledge_ which will be their preservation: Wisdom is therefore found in their lips (v. because it is laid up in their hearts_ out of which store_ like the good householder_ they bring things new and old. Whatever knowledge may be at any time useful to us we must lay it up_ because we know not but some time or other we may have occasion for it. We must continue laying up as long as we live; and be sure to lay it up safely_ that it may not be to seek when we want it,20250223
It is the wisdom of young men to turn a deaf ear to such instructions_ as the adder does to the charms that are designed to ensnare her. __Dread hearing such talk as tends top instil loose principles into the mind; and_ if thou art linked in with such_ break off from them; thou hast heard enough_ or too much_ and therefore hear no more of the evil communication which corrupts good manners.__,20250223
It is therefore as much our interest_ as our duty_ to bring our wills to the will of God.,20250223
It is therefore far better_ and more desirable_ to have but a little of the world and to have it with a good conscience_ to keep up communion with God_ and enjoy him in it_ and live by faith_ than to have the greatest plenty and live without God in the world.,20250223
It is therefore folly for us to set our eyes upon them_ to admire them as the best things_ to appropriate them to ourselves as our good things_ and to aim at them as our mark at which all our actions are levelled_ to fly upon them as the eagle upon her prey. __Wilt thou do a thing so absurd in itself? What thou_ a reasonable creature_ wilt thou dote upon shadows? The eyes are put for rational and intellectual powers; wilt thou throw those away upon such undeserving objects? To set the hands and feet upon the world is well enough_ but not the eyes_ the eyes of the mind; those were made to contemplate better things. Wilt thou_ my son_ that professest religion_ put such an affront upon God (towards whom the eyes should ever be) and such an abuse upon thy soul?__,20250223
It is therefore good to keep our mouth as with a bridle: He that refrains his lips_ that often checks himself_ suppresses what he has thought_ and holds in that which would transpire_ is a wise man; it is an evidence of his wisdom_ and he therein consults his own peace. Little said is soon amended_ Amos v. 13; Jam. i. 19.,20250223
It is therefore impossible for him to see and hear what is done at so great a distance as this earth_ especially since there is a dark cloud (v. many thick clouds (v. that come between him and us_ and are a covering to him_ so that he cannot see_ much less can he judge of_ the affairs of this lower world; as if God had eyes of flesh_ ch. x,20250223
It is therefore with good reason taken notice of_ to Sarah's praise_ that she spoke respectfully of her husband_ calling him lord. She pleases herself with this that he is not at home_ and therefore she is melancholy if she have not some company_ and therefore whatever company she has she may be free with them_ for she is from under his eye_ and he shall never know. But will he not return quickly? No: __he has gone a long journey_ and cannot return on a sudden; he appointed the day of his return_ and he never comes home sooner than he says he will. He has taken a bag of money with him_ either___ ,20250223
It is this that gives weight to what we speak and adds learning to it_ strength of reason and force of argument_ without which_ let a thing be ever so well worded_ it will be rejected_ when it comes to be considered_ as trifling. Quaint expressions please the ear_ and humour the fancy_ but it is learning in the lips that must convince the judgment_ and sway that_ to which wisdom in the heart is necessary.,20250223
It is to be done all the days of our life. The good we are to do we must persevere in the doing of to the end_ while our doing time lasts_ the number of the days of our life (so it is in the margin); the days of our life are numbered to us by him in whose hand our times are and they are all to be spent as he directs. But that any man should give himself to wine_ in hopes to find out in that the best way of living in this world_ was an absurdity which Solomon here_ in the reflection_ condemns himself for. Is it possible that this should be the good that men should do? No; it is plainly very bad.,20250223
It is to be lamented that he is so little enquired after by the children of men. All are asking_ Where is mirth? Where is wealth? Where is a good bargain? But none ask_ Where is God my Maker?,20250223
It is to encourage her under her present dejections. Whatever others thought of her_ she was amiable in his eyes. ,20250223
It is to invite others to think well of her too_ and to join themselves to her: __Thou art my love_ thou lovest me and art beloved of me_ and therefore thou art fair.__ All the beauty of the saints is derived from him_ and they shine by reflecting his light; it is the beauty of the Lord our God that is upon us_ Ps. xc,20250223
It is to no purpose to speak in a cause that is already prejudged. With men it is often labour in vain for the most innocent to go about to clear themselves; they must be adjudged guilty_ though the evidence be ever so plain for them. But it is not so in our dealings with God_ who is the patron of oppressed innocency and to whom it was never in vain to commit a righteous cause. Nay_ he not only despairs of relief_ but expects that his endeavour to clear himself will render him yet more obnoxious (v. 30_ 31): __If I wash myself with snow-water_ and make my integrity ever so evident_ it will be all to no purpose; judgment must go against me. Thou shalt plunge me in the ditch__ (the pit of destruction_ so some_ or rather the filthy kennel_ or sewer)_ __which will make me so offensive in the nostrils of all about me that my own clothes shall abhor me and I shall even loathe to touch myself.__ He saw his afflictions coming from God. Those were the things that blackened him in the eye of his friends; and_ upon that score_ he complained of them_ and of the continuance of them_ as the ruin_ not only of his comfort_ but of his reputation. Yet these words are capable of a good construction. If we be ever so industrious to justify ourselves before men_ and to preserve our credit with them_—if we keep our hands ever so clean from the pollutions of gross sin_ which fall under the eye of the world_—yet God_ who knows our hearts_ can charge us with so much secret sin as will for ever take off all our pretensions to purity and innocency_ and make us see ourselves odious in the sight of the holy God. Paul_ while a Pharisee_ made his hands very clean; but when the commandment came and discovered to him his heart-sins_ made him know lust_ that plunged him in the ditch. ,20250223
It is to rectify our errors_ and the false principles we went upon in doing as we did. What we have long_ and often_ and vigorously maintained_ once_ yea_ twice_ we must retract as soon as we are convinced that it is a mistake_ not adhere to it any longer_ but take shame to ourselves for holding it so long. ,20250223
It is to return from every by-path and to proceed not one step further in it: __I will not add__ (so the word is); __I will never indulge my passion so much again_ nor give myself such a liberty of speech_ will never say as I have said nor do as I have done.__ Till it comes to this_ we come short of repentance. Further observe_ Those who dispute with God will be silenced at last. Job had been very bold and forward in demanding a conference with God_ and talked very boldly_ how plain he would make his case_ and how sure he was that he should be justified. As a prince he would go near unto him (ch. xxxi.,20250223
It is to teach her what to value herself upon_ not any external advantages (which would add nothing to her_ and the want of which would deprive her of nothing that was really excellent)_ but upon the comeliness of grace which he had put upon her. ,20250223
It is too common a thing for honour to be given to fools_ who are utterly unworthy of it and unfit for it. Bad men_ who have neither wit nor grace_ are sometimes preferred by princes_ and applauded and cried up by the people. Folly is set in great dignity_ as Solomon observed_ Eccl. x. 6,20250223
It is true of all sinners in general_ and particularly of wicked rulers_ that_ because sentence against their evil works is not executed speedily_ they think it will never be executed_ and therefore they set the law at defiance and their hearts are full in them to do evil; they venture to do so much the more mischief_ fetch a greater compass in their wicked designs_ and are secure and fearless in it_ and commit iniquity with a high hand. Observe_ ,20250223
It is twofold:—,20250223
It is upon all accounts better to take our lot with those whose condition is low_ and their minds brought to it_ than to covet and aim to make a figure and a bustle in the world. Humility_ though it should expose us to contempt in the world_ yet while it recommends us to the favour of God_ qualifies us for his gracious visits_ prepares us for his glory_ secures us from many temptations_ and preserves the quiet and repose of our own souls_ is much better than that high-spiritedness which_ though it carry away the honour and wealth of the world_ makes God a man's enemy and the devil his master.,20250223
It is upon pain of death_ eternal death_ and in prospect of life_ eternal life_ that we are required to be religious. __Receive wisdom's sayings_ and the years of thy life shall be many (v. as many in this world as Infinite Wisdom sees fit_ and in the other world thou shalt live that life the years of which shall never be numbered. Keep her therefore_ whatever it cost thee_ for she is thy life_ v,20250223
It is very absurd and unbecoming when it is so. It is an incongruous as snow in summer_ and as great a disorder in the commonwealth as that is in the course of nature and in the seasons of the year; nay_ it is as injurious as rain in harvest_ which hinders the labourers and spoils the fruits of the earth when they are ready to be gathered. When bad men are in power they commonly abuse their power_ in discouraging virtue_ and giving countenance to wickedness_ for want of wisdom to discern it and grace to detest it.,20250223
It is very dangerous. __Shun those that delight to do mischief as thou tenderest thy own safety; for_ whatever friendship they may pretend_ one time or other they will do thee mischief; thou wilt ruin thyself if thou dost concur with them (ch.,20250223
It is very desirable that the spices of grace should flow forth both in pious and devout affections and in holy gracious actions_ that with them we may honour God_ adorn our profession_ and do that which will be grateful to good men.,20250223
It is very scandalous; for there is no disposition of mind that is a greater reproach to human nature_ a greater enemy to human society_ a bolder defiance to God and conscience_ that has more of the devil's image in it_ or is more serviceable to his interests_ than a delight to do mischief and to vex_ and hurt_ and ruin every body. ,20250223
It is very unseemly for one that is a servant to sin and his lusts to rule over and oppress those that are God's freemen and made kings and priests to him.,20250223
It is well with a people when their princes are examples of temperance_ when those that have most to spend upon themselves know how to deny themselves.,20250223
It is well with those that are wise in their latter end_ wise for their latter end_ for their future state_ wise for another world_ that are found wise when their latter end comes_ wise virgins_ wise builders_ wise stewards_ that are wise at length_ and understand the things that belong to their peace_ before they be hidden from their eyes. A carnal worldling at his end shall be a fool (Jer. but godliness will prove wisdom at last,20250223
It is wisdom to be cautious. Every prudent discreet man does all with knowledge (considering with himself and consulting with others)_ acts with deliberation and is upon the reserve_ is careful not to meddle with that which he has not some knowledge of_ not to launch out into business which he has not acquainted himself with_ will not deal with those that he has not some knowledge of_ whether they may be confided in. He is still dealing in knowledge_ that he may increase the stock he has,20250223
It is wisdom to be cautious: The prudent man will try before he trusts_ will weigh both the credibility of the witness and the probability of the testimony_ and then give judgment as the thing appears or suspend his judgment till it appears. Prove all things_ and believe not every spirit.,20250223
It is wisdom_ as well as good manners_ not to be troublesome to our friends in our visiting them_ not to visit too often_ nor stay too long_ nor contrive to come at meal-time_ nor make ourselves busy in the affairs of their families; hereby we make ourselves cheap_ mean_ and burdensome. Thy neighbour_ who is thus plagued and haunted with thy visits_ will be weary of thee and hate thee_ and that will be the destruction of friendship which should have been the improvement of it. Post tres sæpe dies piscis vilescit et hospes—After the third day fish and company become distasteful. Familiarity breeds contempt. Nulli te facias nimis sodalem—Be not too intimate with any. He that sponges upon his friend loses him. How much better a friend then is God than any other friend; for we need not withdraw our foot from his house_ the throne of his grace (ch. viii. 34); the oftener we come to him the better and the more welcome.,20250223
It is written indeed_ Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people; but if he be a wicked ruler_ that oppresses the people_ especially the poor people_ robbing them of the little they have and making a prey of them_ whatever we may call him_ this scripture calls him a roaring lion and a ranging bear. 1. In respect of his character. He is brutish_ barbarous_ and blood-thirsty; he is rather to be put among the beasts of prey_ the wildest and most savage_ than to be reckoned of that noble rank of beings whose glory is reason and humanity,20250223
It is_ at the best_ in this world_ but fair as the moon_ which shines with a borrowed light_ which has her changes and eclipses_ and her spots too_ and_ when at the full_ does but rule by night. But_ ,20250223
It kept him tight and steady in all his motions. He always appeared in it_ as in his clothing_ and never without it. Righteousness will clothe those that put it on; it will keep them warm_ and be comfortable to them; it will keep them safe_ and fence them against the injuries of the season; it will adorn them_ and recommend them to the favour both of God and man. ,20250223
It makes him useful among his neighbours and very serviceable to them: Who but the wise man knows the interpretation of a thing_ that is_ understands the times and the events of them_ and their critical junctures_ so as to direct what Israel ought to do_ 1 Chron. xii. 32,20250223
It makes men provoking to God: A furious man_ who is wedded to his humours and passions_ cannot but abound in transgressions. Undue anger is a sin which is the cause of many sins; it not only hinders men from calling upon God's name_ but it occasions their swearing_ and cursing_ and profaning God's name.,20250223
It makes them useful: The lips of the righteous feed many; for they are full of the word of God_ which is the bread of life_ and that sound doctrine wherewith souls are nourished up. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy_ to the hungry.,20250223
It may as well be read_ He that is of great wrath (meaning the child that is to be corrected and is impatient of rebuke_ cries and makes a noise_ even that wrath of his against the rod of correction) deserves to be punished; for_ if thou deliver him for the sake of that_ thou wilt be forced to punish him so much the more next time. A stomachful high-spirited child must be subdued betimes_ or it will be the worse for it.,20250223
It may be applied to any other that belong to the election of grace_ but are yet uncalled. They are remotely related to Christ and his church_ and sisters to them both_ other sheep that are not of this fold_ John x. 16; Acts xviii,20250223
It may be read as a precept to the kings and judges of the earth to be wise and instructed. Let them be just_ and rule in the fear of God; let them act with such wisdom and conscience that there may appear a holy divination in all they say or do_ and that they are guided by principles supernatural: let not their mouths transgress in judgment_ for the judgment is God's.,20250223
It may justly keep us from being proud of our knowledge to consider how many there are that know as much as we do_ and perhaps much more and to better purpose. ,20250223
It may look green and gay for a while (the rush outgrows the grass)_ but it is light and hollow_ and empty_ and good for nothing. It is green for show_ but of no use. ,20250223
It may perhaps be taken from him_ and fly away like an eagle towards heaven: It shall be accomplished (or cut off) before his time (v. 32); that is_ he shall survive his prosperity_ and see himself stripped of it. Fifthly_ He is in care_ when he is in trouble_ how to get out of it (not how to get good by it); but in this also he is crossed (v. 30): He shall not depart out of darkness. When he begins to fall_ like Haman_ all men say_ __Down with him.__ It was said of him (v.,20250223
It might be objected against his judgment in this matter that if his wisdom remained with him he could not take the liberty that was necessary to a full experimental acquaintance with it: __Yea___ said he_ __I took as great a liberty as any man could take_ for whatsoever my eyes desired I kept not from them_ if it could be compassed by lawful means_ though ever so difficult or costly; and as I withheld not any joy from my heart that I had a mind to_ so I withheld not my heart from any joy_ but_ with a non-obstante—with the full exercise of my wisdom_ I had a high gust of my pleasures_ relished and enjoyed them as much as ever any Epicure did;__ nor was there any thing either in the circumstances of his condition or in the temper of his spirit to sour or embitter them_ or give them any alloy. In short_ ,20250223
It might justly become the ruin of his estate; nay_ he knew it would be so (v. 12): It is a fire. Lust is a fire in the soul: those that indulge it are said to burn. It consumes all that is good there (the convictions_ the comforts)_ and lays the conscience waste. It kindles the fire of God's wrath_ which_ if not extinguished by the blood of Christ_ will burn to the lowest hell. It will consume even to that eternal destruction. It consumes the body_ Prov. v,20250223
It must be confessed_ on the one hand_ that if he who barely reads this book be asked_ as the eunuch was Understandest thou what thou readest? he will have more reason than he had to say_ How can I_ except some man shall guide me? The books of scripture-history and prophecy are very much like one another_ but this Song of Solomon's is very much unlike the songs of his father David; here is not the name of God in it; it is never quoted in the New Testament; we find not in it any expressions of natural religion or pious devotion_ no_ nor is it introduced by vision_ or any of the marks of immediate revelation. It seems as hard as any part of scripture to be made a savour of life unto life_ nay_ and to those who come to the reading of it with carnal minds and corrupt affections_ it is in danger of being made a savour of death unto death; it is a flower out of which they extract poison; and therefore the Jewish doctors advised their young people not to read it till they were thirty years old_ lest by the abuse of that which is most pure and sacred (horrendum dictu—horrible to say!) the flames of lust should be kindled with fire from heaven_ which is intended for the altar only. But_,20250223
It must be confessed_ on the other hand_ that with the help of the many faithful guides we have for the understanding of this book it appears to be a very bright and powerful ray of heavenly light_ admirable fitted to excite pious and devout affections in holy souls_ to draw out their desires towards God_ to increase their delight in him_ and improve their acquaintance and communion with him. It is an allegory_ the letter of which kills those who rest in that and look no further_ but the spirit of which gives life_ 2 Cor. iii. 6; John vi. 63. It is a parable_ which makes divine things more difficult to those who do not love them_ but more plain and pleasant to those,20250223
It must be owned that there is very much truth in what Job here means_ that temporal judgments_ when they are sent abroad_ fall both upon good and bad_ and the destroying angel seldom distinguishes (though once he did) between the houses of Israelites and the houses of Egyptians. In the judgment of Sodom indeed_ which is called the vengeance of eternal fire (Jude far be it from God to slay the righteous with the wicked_ and that the righteous should be as the wicked (Gen. xviii. 25); but_ in judgments merely temporal_ the righteous have their share_ and sometimes the greatest share. The sword devours one as well as another_ Josiah as well as Ahab. Thus God destroys the perfect and the wicked_ involves them both in the same common ruin; good and bad were sent together into Babylon_ Jer. xxiv. 5_ 9. If the scourge slay suddenly_ and sweep down all before it_ God will be well pleased to see how the same scourge which is the perdition of the wicked is the trial of the innocent and of their faith_ which will be found unto praise_ and honour_ and glory_ 1 Pet. i. 7; Ps. lxvi. 10.,20250223
It must be thy bread_ that which is honestly got; it is no charity_ but injury_ to give that which is none of our own to give; first do justly_ and then love mercy. __Thy bread_ which thou didst design for thyself_ let the poor have a share with thee_ as they had with Job_ ch. xxxi,20250223
It ought to be marvellous in our eyes. The beauty and excellency of the work of God_ and the agreement of all the parts of it_ are what we must remember to magnify and highly to extol_ not only justify it as right and good_ and what cannot be blamed_ but magnify it as wise and glorious_ and such as no creature could contrive or produce. Man may see his works_ and is capable of discerning his hand in them (which the beasts are not)_ and therefore ought to praise them and give him the glory of them.,20250223
It ought to be the great care of old people to be found in the way of righteousness_ the way of religion and serious godliness. Both God and man will look for them in that way; it will be expected that those that are old should be good_ that the multitude of their years should teach them the best wisdom; let them therefore be found in that way. Death will come; the Judge is coming; the Lord is at hand. That they may be found of him in peace_ let them be found in the way of righteousness (2 Pet. iii. found so doing_ Matt. xxiv,20250223
It presents us with a great example of patience and close adherence to God in the midst of the sorest calamities. Sir Richard Blackmore's most ingenious pen_ in his excellent preface to his paraphrase on this book_ makes Job a hero proper for an epic poem; for_ says he_ __He appears brave in distress and valiant in affliction_ maintains his virtue_ and with that his character_ under the most exasperating provocations that the malice of hell could invent_ and thereby gives a most noble example of passive fortitude_ a character no way inferior to that of the active hero___ &c. ,20250223
It presents us with a specimen of Gentile piety. This great saint descended probably not from Abraham_ but Nahor; or_ if from Abraham_ not from Isaac_ but from one of the sons of the concubines that were sent into the east-country (Gen. xxv. 6); or_ if from Isaac_ yet not from Jacob_ but Esau; so that he was out of the pale of the covenant of peculiarity_ no Israelite_ no proselyte_ and yet none like him for religion_ nor such a favourite of heaven upon this earth. It was a truth therefore_ before St. Peter perceived it_ that in every nation he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted of him_ Acts x,20250223
It presents us with an exposition of the book of Providence_ and a clear and satisfactory solution of many of the difficult and obscure passages of it. The prosperity of the wicked and the afflictions of the righteous have always been reckoned two as hard chapters as any in that book; but they are here expounded_ and reconciled with the divine wisdom_ purity_ and goodness_ by the end of these things. ,20250223
It presents us with an illustrious type of Christ_ the particulars of which we shall endeavour to take notice of as we go along. In general_ Job was a great sufferer_ was emptied and humbled_ but in order to his greater glory. So Christ abased himself_ that we might be exalted. The learned bishop Patrick quotes St. Jerome ore than once speaking of Job as a type of Christ_ who for the job that was set before him endured the cross_ who was persecuted_ for a time_ by men and devils_ and seemed forsaken of God too_ but was raised to be an intercessor even for his friends and had added affliction to his misery. When the apostle speaks of the patience of Job he immediately takes notice of the end of the Lord_ that is_ of the Lord Jesus (as some understand it)_ typified by Job_ James v. 11.,20250223
It rises up to fury_ and tends to the hurt and injury of others: The end of his talk_ the end it comes to_ is madness. He will presently talk himself into an indecent heat_ and break out into the wild extravagancies of a distracted man. The end he aims at is mischief; as_ at first_ he appeared to have little government of himself_ so_ at last_ it appears he has a great deal of malice to his neighbours; that root of bitterness bears gall and wormwood. Note_ It is not strange if those that begin foolishly end madly; for an ungoverned tongue_ the more liberty is allowed_ grows the more violent,20250223
It ruins the estate (v. 10): __Strangers will be filled with thy wealth_ which thou art but entrusted with as a steward for thy family; and the fruit of thy labours_ which should be provision for thy own house_ will be in the house of a stranger_ that neither has right to it nor will ever thank thee for it.__ ,20250223
It ruins the reputation and entails perpetual infamy upon that. It is a much more scandalous sin than stealing is_ v. 30-33. Perhaps it is not so in the account of men_ at least not in our day. A thief is sent to the stocks_ to the gaol_ to Bridewell_ to the gallows_ while the vile adulterer goes unpunished_ nay_ with many_ unblemished; he dares boast of his villanies_ and they are made but a jest of. But_ in the account of God and his law_ adultery was much the more enormous crime; and_ if God is the fountain of honour_ his word must be the standard of it. ,20250223
It seems especially to mean the honour done him by his church_ as his mother_ and by all true believers_ in whose hearts he is formed_ and of whom he has said_ These are my mother_ my sister_ and brother_ Matt. xii,20250223
It should seem_ before he either heard or saw any thing_ he was seized with this trembling_ which shook his bones_ and perhaps the bed under him. A holy awe and reverence of God and his majesty being struck upon his spirit_ he was thereby prepared for a divine visit. Whom God intends to honour he first humbles and lays low_ and will have us all to serve him with holy fear_ and to rejoice with trembling.,20250223
It should seem_ the youth_ though very simple_ had no ill design_ else a word_ a beck_ a wink_ would have served_ and there would have been no need of all this harangue; but though he did not intend any such thing_ nay_ had something in his conscience that opposed it_ yet with her much fair speech she caused him to yield. His corruptions at length triumphed over his convictions_ and his resolutions were not strong enough to hold out against such artful attacks as these_ but with the flattery of her lips she forced him; he could not stop his ear against such a charmer_ but surrendered himself her captive. Wisdom's maidens_ who plead her cause_ and have reason on their side_ and true and divine pleasures to invite men to_ have a deaf ear turned to them_ and with all their rhetoric cannot compel men to come in_ but such is the dominion of sin in the hearts of men that its allurements soon prevail by falsehood and flattery. With what pity does Solomon here look upon this foolish young man_ when he sees him follow the adulterous woman! ,20250223
It threatens death; it kills men: The adulteress will hunt for the precious life_ perhaps designedly_ as Delilah for Samson's_ at least_ eventually_ the sin strikes at the life. Adultery was punished by the law of Moses as a capital crime. The adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. Every one knew this. Those therefore who_ for the gratifying of a base lust_ would lay themselves open to the law_ could be reckoned no better than self-murderers.,20250223
It very much increases the affliction of sickness and age_ to a good man_ that he is thereby forced from his usefulness. He insists not so much upon it that they are days in which he has no pleasure as that they are days in which he does not good; on that account they are months of vanity. But when we are disabled to work for God_ if we will but sit still quietly for him_ it is all one; we shall be accepted.,20250223
It vexed him to see many that had wisdom not use it_ and many that had folly not strive against it. It vexed him when he knew wisdom to see how far off it stood from the children of men_ and_ when he saw folly_ to see how fast it was bound in their hearts.,20250223
It was a plain and easy way of teaching_ which cost neither the teachers nor the learners much pains_ nor put their understandings nor their memories to the stretch. Long periods_ and arguments far-fetched_ must be laboured both by him that frames them and by him that would understand them_ while a proverb_ which carries both its sense and its evidence in a little compass_ is quickly apprehended and subscribed to_ and is easily retained. Both David's devotions and Solomon's instructions are sententious_ which may recommend that way of expression to those who minister about holy things_ both in praying and preaching,20250223
It was a sign that God had hidden their heart from understanding,20250223
It was a sword in his bones_ which pierced him in the night season_ when he should have been refreshed with sleep. His nerves were affected with strong convulsions; his sinews took no rest. By reason of his pain_ he could take no rest_ but sleep departed from his eyes. His bones were burnt with heat_ v,20250223
It was a very profitable way of teaching_ and served admirably well to answer the end. The word Mashal_ here used for a proverb_ comes from a word that signifies to rule or have dominion_ because of the commanding power and influence which wise and weighty sayings have upon the children of men; he that teaches by them dominatur in concionibus—rules his auditory. It is easy to observe how the world is governed by proverbs. As saith the proverb of the ancients (1 Sam. xxiv. or (as we commonly express it) As the old saying is_ goes very far with most men in forming their notions and fixing their resolves. Much of the wisdom of the ancients has been handed down to posterity by proverbs; and some think we may judge of the temper and character of a nation by the complexion of its vulgar proverbs. Proverbs in conversation are like axioms in philosophy_ maxims in law_ and postulata in the mathematics_ which nobody disputes_ but every one endeavours to expound so as to have them on his side. Yet there are many corrupt proverbs_ which tend to debauch men's minds and harden them in sin. The devil has his proverbs_ and the world and the flesh have their proverbs_ which reflect reproach on God and religion (as Ezek. xii. 22; xviii. to guard us against the corrupt influences of which God has his proverbs_ which are all wise and good_ and tend to make us so. These proverbs of Solomon were not merely a collection of the wise sayings that had been formerly delivered_ as some have imagined_ but were the dictates of the Spirit of God in Solomon. The very first of them (ch. i. 7) agrees with what God said to man in the beginning (Job xxviii. 28_ Behold_ the fear of the Lord_ that is wisdom); so that though Solomon was great_ and his name may serve as much as any man's to recommend his writings_ yet_ behold_ a greater than Solomon is here. It is God_ by Solomon_ that here speaks to us: I say_ to us; for these proverbs were written for our learning_ and_ when Solomon speaks to his son_ the exhortation is said to speak to us as unto children_ Heb. xii,20250223
It was as absurd as it would be to call a most righteous innocent person to the bar_ and to give judgment against him_ though it appeared ever so plainly_ upon the trial_ that he was most just: Wilt thou condemn him that is righteous in all his ways_ and cannot but be so? 3. It is more absurd and unbecoming than it would be to say to a sovereign prince_ Thou art wicked_ and to judges upon the bench_ You are ungodly_,20250223
It was brought to him in the visions of the night (v. when he had retired from the world and the hurry of it_ and all about him was composed and quiet. Note_ The more we are withdrawn from the world and the things of it the fitter we are for communion with God. When we are communing with our own hearts_ and are still (Ps. iv. then is a proper time for the Holy Spirit to commune with us. When others were asleep Eliphaz was ready to receive this visit from Heaven_ and probably_ like David_ was meditating upon God in the night-watches; in the midst of those good thoughts this thing was brought to him. We should hear more from God if we thought more of him; yet some are surprised with convictions in the night_ ch. xxxiii. 14_ 15,20250223
It was by night on her bed; it was late and lazy seeking. Her understanding was clouded; it was by night_ in the dark. Her affections were chilled_ it was on her bed half asleep. The wise virgins slumbered in the absence of the bridegroom. It was a dark time with the believer; she saw not her signs_ and yet she sought them. Those whose souls love Jesus Christ will continue to seek him even in silence and solitude: their reins instruct them to do so_ even in the night season,20250223
It was growing_ still growing worse and worse. This he insists much upon; when he hoped the tide would turn_ and begin to ebb_ still it flowed higher and higher. His affliction increased_ and God's indignation in the affliction. He found himself no better_ no way better. These witnesses were renewed against him_ that_ if one did not reach to convict him_ another might. Changes and war were against him. If there was any change with him_ it was not for the better; still he was kept in a state of war. As long as we are here in this world we must expect that the clouds will return after the rain_ and perhaps the sorest and sharpest trials may be reserved for the last. God was at war with him_ and it was a great change. He did not use to be so_ which aggravated the trouble and made it truly marvellous. God usually shows himself kind to his people; if at any time he shows himself otherwise_ it is his strange work_ his strange act_ and he does in it show himself marvellous.,20250223
It was his comfort that he had not concealed them_ had not received the grace of God therein in vain. ,20250223
It was not only a passionate weariness of this life that he wished to die_ but in a pious assurance of a better life_ to which at length he should arise. O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave! The grave is not only a resting-place_ but a hiding-place_ to the people of God. God has the key of the grave_ to let in now and to let out at the resurrection. He hides men in the grave_ as we hide our treasure in a place of secresy and safety; and he who hides will find_ and nothing shall be lost. __O that thou wouldst hide me_ not only from the storms and troubles of this life_ but for the bliss and glory of a better life! Let me lie in the grave_ reserved for immortality_ in secret from all the world_ but not from thee_ not from those eyes which saw my substance when first curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth___ Ps. cxxxix. 15_,20250223
It was not true that God did thus seek advantages against him. He is not thus extreme to mark what we do amiss; if he were_ there were no abiding for us_ Ps. cxxx,20250223
It was not we_ it was not any man that commanded the morning-light at first_ or appointed the place of its springing up and shining forth_ or the time of it. The constant and regular succession of day and night was no contrivance of ours; it is the glory of God that it shows_ and his handy work_ not ours_ Ps. xix. 1_ 2,20250223
It was prefaced with terrors: Fear came upon him_ and trembling_ v,20250223
It was rational business_ which related to the government of his kingdom and the advancement of its interests. It was labour managed by the dictates of wisdom_ of natural and acquired knowledge_ and the directions of justice. It was labour at the council-board and in the courts of justice. It was labour wherein he showed himself wise (v. which as much excels the labour wherein men only show themselves strong as the endowments of the mind_ by which we are allied to angels_ do those of the body_ which we have in common with the brutes. That which many people have in their eye more than any thing else_ in the prosecution of their worldly business_ is to show themselves wise_ to get the reputation of ingenious men and men of sense and application.,20250223
It was so here in the story of Job; at the evening-time it was light. Three things we have met with in this book which_ I confess _ have troubled me very much; but we find all the three grievances redressed_ thoroughly redressed_ in this chapter_ everything set to-rights.,20250223
It was true concerning Solomon who wrote this; he had extraordinary wisdom_ pursuant to the promise God made him_ See 1 Kings iii. 28.,20250223
It was unadvisedly said_ and therefore we will not dwell too much upon it. God does indeed see all our sins; he sees sin in his own people; but he is not severe in reckoning with us_ nor is the law ever stretched against us_ but we are punished less than our iniquities deserve. God does indeed seal and sew up_ against the day of wrath_ the transgression of the impenitent_ but the sins of his people he blots out as a cloud.,20250223
It wastes the time_ gives the years_ the years of youth_ the flower of men's time_ unto the cruel_ __that base lust of thine_ which with the utmost cruelty wars against the soul_ that base harlot which pretends an affection for thee_ but really hunts for the precious life.__ Those years that should be given to the honour of a gracious God are spent in the service of a cruel sin. ,20250223
It well becomes penitents to say the worst they can of sin_ for the truth is we can never speak ill enough of it. Solomon here_ for his further humiliation_ desired to see more_,20250223
It will amaze them: Upright men shall be astonished at this; they will wonder to hear that so good a man as Job should be so grievously afflicted in body_ name_ and estate_ that God should lay his hand so heavily upon him_ and that his friends_ who ought to have comforted him_ should add to his grief_ that such a remarkable saint should be such a remarkable sufferer_ and so useful a man laid aside in the midst of his usefulness; what shall we say to these things? Upright men_ though satisfied in general that God is wise and holy in all he does_ yet cannot but be astonished at such dispensations of Providence_ paradoxes which will not be unfolded till the mystery of God shall be finished. ,20250223
It will animate them. Instead of being deterred from and discouraged in the service of God_ by the hard usage which this faithful servant of God met with_ they shall be so much the more emboldened to proceed and persevere in it. That which was St. Paul's care (1 Thess. iii. 3) was Job's_ that no good man should be moved_ either from his holiness or his comfort_ by these afflictions_ that none should_ for the sake hereof_ think the worse of the ways or work of God. And that which was St. Paul's comfort was his too_ that the brethren in the Lord would wax confident by his bonds_ Phil. i,20250223
It will arrive_ in the end_ at the perfect day. The light of the dayspring will at length be noon-day light_ and it is this that the enlightened soul is pressing towards. The saints will not be perfect till they come to heaven_ but there they shall themselves shine as the sun when he goes forth in his strength_ Matt. xiii,20250223
It will be a likely means to win upon them_ and bring them over to be reconciled to us; we shall mollify them as the refiner melts the metal in the crucible_ not only by putting it over the fire_ but by heaping coals of fire upon it. The way to turn an enemy into a friend is_ to act towards him in a friendly manner. If it do not gain him_ it will aggravate his sin and punishment_ and heap the burning coals of God's wrath upon his head_ as rejoicing in his calamity may be an occasion of God's turning his wrath from him_ ch. xxiv,20250223
It will be a total terrible ruin. When the dart that has struck him through (for when God shoots he is sure to hit his mark_ when he strikes he strikes home) comes to be drawn out of his body_ when the glittering sword (the lightning_ so the word is)_ the flaming sword_ the sword that is bathed in heaven (Isa. xxxiv. comes out of his gall_ O what terrors are upon him! How strong are the convulsions_ how violent are the dying agonies! How terrible are the arrests of death to a wicked man!,20250223
It will be a wound to his good name_ a dishonour to his family_ and_ though the guilt of it may be done away by repentance_ the reproach of it never will_ but will stick to his memory when he is gone. David's sin in the matter of Uriah was not only a perpetual blemish upon his own character_ but gave occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme his name too.,20250223
It will be found after many days_ for the days of eternity. ,20250223
It will be our companion_ and we must converse with it: __When thou awakest in the night_ and knowest not how to pass away thy waking minutes_ if thou pleasest_ it shall talk with thee_ and entertain thee with pleasant meditations in the night-watch; when thou awakest in the morning_ and art contriving the work of the day_ it shall talk with thee about it_ and help thee to contrive for the best___ Ps. i,20250223
It will be our guard_ and we must put ourselves under the protection of it: __When thou sleepest_ and liest exposed to the malignant powers of darkness_ it shall keep thee; thou shalt be safe_ and shalt think thyself so.__ If we govern ourselves by the precepts of the word all day_ and make conscience of the duty God has commanded to us_ we may shelter ourselves under the promises of the word at night_ and take the comfort of the deliverances God does and will command for us. ,20250223
It will be our guide_ and we must follow its direction. __When thou goest_ it shall lead thee (v. 22); it shall lead thee into_ and lead thee in_ the good and right way_ shall lead thee from_ and lead thee out of_ every sinful dangerous path. It will say unto thee_ when thou art ready to turn aside_ This is the way; walk in it. It will be that to thee that the pillar of cloud and fire was to Israel in the wilderness. Be led by that_ let it be thy rule_ and then thou shalt be led by the Spirit; he will be thy monitor and support.__ ,20250223
It will be our life; for_ as the law is a lamp and a light for the present_ so the reproofs of instruction are the way of life. Those reproofs of the word which not only show us our faults_ but instruct us how to do better_ are the way that leads to life_ eternal life. Let not faithful reproofs therefore_ which have such a direct tendency to make us happy_ ever make us uneasy.,20250223
It will be our wisdom to walk in that way_ to ask for the good old way and walk therein_ Jer. vi. 16; Heb. vi. 12;,20250223
It will be the bettering of the subjects; they shall be made like silver refined_ fit to be made vessels of honour. ,20250223
It will be the establishment_ Of their persons: The upright shall dwell in the land_ peaceably and quietly_ as long as they live; and their uprightness will contribute to it_ as it settles their minds_ guides their counsels_ gains them the good-will of their neighbours_ and entitles them to God's special favour.,20250223
It will be the great aggravation of the misery of wicked people that their hopes will sink into despair just when they expect them to be crowned with fruition. When a godly man dies his expectations are out-done_ and all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies his expectations are dashed_ dashed to pieces; in that very day his thoughts perish with which he had pleased himself_ his hopes vanish.,20250223
It will be the settling of the prince. His throne shall be established in this righteousness_ for God will bless his government_ the people will be pliable to it_ and so it will become durable.,20250223
It will be very profitable. Honey may be sweet to the taste and yet not wholesome_ but wisdom has a future recompence attending it_ as well as a present sweetness in it. __Thou art permitted to eat honey_ and the agreeableness of it to thy taste invites thee to it; but thou hast much more reason to relish and digest the precepts of wisdom_ for when thou hast found that_ there shall be a reward; thou shalt be paid for thy pleasure_ while the servants of sin pay dearly for their pains. Wisdom does indeed set thee to work_ but there shall be a reward; it does indeed raise great expectations in thee_ but as thy labour_ so thy hope_ shall not be in vain; thy expectation shall not be cut off (ch. xxiii. nay_ it shall be infinitely outdone.__,20250223
It will be well or ill with us according as we do or do not improve the foresight we have of evil before us: The prudent man_ foreseeing the evil_ forecasts accordingly_ and hides himself_ but the simple is either so dull that he does not foresee it or so wilful and slothful that he will take no care to avoid it_ and so he passes on securely and is punished. We do well for ourselves when we provide for hereafter.,20250223
It will easily and certainly be swept away_ as the cobweb with the besom_ when God shall come to purge his house. The prosperity of worldly people will fail them when they expect to find safety and happiness in it. They seek to hold fast their estates_ but God is plucking them out of their hands; and whose shall all those things be_ which they have provided? or what the better they will be for them? The confidences of hypocrites will fail them. I tell you_ I know you not. The house built on the sand will fall in the storm_ when the builder most needs it and promised himself the benefit of it. When a wicked man dies his expectation perishes. The ground of his hopes will prove false; he will be disappointed of the thing he hoped for_ and his foolish hope with which he buoyed himself up will be turned into endless despair; and thus his hope will be cut off_ his web_ that refuge of lies_ swept away_ and he crushed in it.,20250223
It will enrich a house and furnish it_ v.,20250223
It will fill the mind with horror_ if ever conscience be awakened. __Though thou art merry now_ sporting thyself in thy own deceivings_ yet thou wilt certainly mourn at the last_ v,20250223
It will fly away like the sparrow or the wild dove_ which go nobody knows where_ till they return to their proper place_ as the curse will at length return upon the head of him that uttered it.,20250223
It will fortify a house and turn it into a castle: Wisdom is better than weapons of war_ offensive or defensive. A wise man is in strength_ is in a strong-hold_ yea_ a man of knowledge strengthens might_ that is_ increases it_ v,20250223
It will govern a house and a kingdom too_ and the affairs of both_ v,20250223
It will put strength into a man_ and be his stay and support (v. 19): Wisdom strengthens the wise_ strengthens their spirits_ and makes them bold and resolute_ by keeping them always on sure grounds. It strengthens their interest_ and gains them friends and reputation. It strengthens them for their services under their sufferings_ and against the attacks that are made upon them_ more than ten mighty men_ great commanders_ strengthen the city. Those that are truly wise and good are taken under God's protection_ and are safer there than if ten of the mightiest men in the city_ men of the greatest power and interest_ should undertake to secure them_ and become their patrons.,20250223
It will turn to our unspeakable advantage. The promise is general. If any humble himself thus_ whoever he be_ ,20250223
It withers presently_ before any other herb_ v,20250223
It would be a lasting reproach and diminution to them: Therefore shalt thou not exalt them. Those are certainly kept back from honour whose hearts are hidden from understanding. When God infatuates men he will abase them. Surely those who discover so little acquaintance with the methods of Providence shall not have the honour of deciding this controversy! That is reserved for a man of better sense and better temper_ such a one as Elihu afterwards appeared to be. ,20250223
It would be much for his own advantage: __If thou be wise and good_ thou shalt be so for thyself.__ First_ __It will be thy life_ thy comfort_ thy happiness; it is what thou canst not live without:__ Keep my commandments and live_ v,20250223
It would be noisome to describe what a condition poor Job was in for want of clean linen and good attendance_ and what filthy rags all his clothes were. Some think that_ among other diseases_ Job was ill of a quinsy or swelling in his throat_ and that it was this which bound him about like a stiff collar. Thus was he cast into the mire (v. compared to mire (so some); his body looked more like a heap of dirt than any thing else. Let none be proud of their clothing nor proud of their cleanness; they know not but some disease or other may change their garments_ and even throw them into the mire_ and make them noisome both to themselves and others. Instead of sweet smell_ there shall be a stench_ Isa. iii,20250223
It would direct them into_ and keep them in_ the way of good men_ ver. 20-22. So that in this chapter we are taught both how to get wisdom and how to use it when we have it_ that we may neither seek it_ nor receive it in vain.,20250223
It would entail a curse upon their families. He that thus violates the sacred laws of friendship forfeits the benefit of it_ not only for himself_ but for his posterity: __Even the eyes of his children shall fail_ and_ when they look for succour and comfort from their own and their father's friends_ they shall look in vain as I have done_ and be as much disappointed as I am in you.__ Note_ Those that wrong their neighbours may thereby_ in the end_ wrong their own children more than they are aware of.,20250223
It would have been better for the judges to have had no power than to have had it and used it to such ill purposes; and so they will say another day.,20250223
It would have been better for the people to have had no judges than to have had such. ,20250223
It would not avail_ ,20250223
Its pollution (v. 4): Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? If man be born of a woman that is a sinner_ how can it be otherwise than that he should be a sinner? See ch. xxv,20250223

Jacob enchanted Esau with a present and Abigail David. To those that may say any thing it is wisdom to say nothing that is provoking.,20250223
Jealousy is cruel as the grave_ which swallows up and devours all; those that truly love Christ are jealous of every thing that would draw them from him_ and especially jealous of themselves_ lest they should do any thing to provoke him to withdraw from them_ and_ rather than do so_ would pluck out a right eye and cut off a right hand_ than which what can be more cruel? Weak and trembling saints_ who conceive a jealousy of Christ_ doubting of his love to them_ find that jealousy to prey upon them like the grave; nothing wastes the spirits more; but it is an evidence of the strength of their love to him. ,20250223
Jedediah—beloved of the Lord. Lemuel is supposed to be a pretty_ fond_ endearing name_ by which his mother used to call him; and so much did he value himself upon the interest he had in his mother's affections that he was not ashamed to call himself by it. One would the rather incline to think it is Solomon that here tells us what his mother taught him because he tells us (ch. iv. 4) what his father taught him. But some think (and the conjecture is not improbable) that Lemuel was a prince of some neighbouring country_ whose mother was a daughter of Israel_ perhaps of the house of David_ and taught him these good lessons. Note,20250223
Jesus Christ has a great complacency in his church and in every true believer; they are amiable in his eyes (v. 15): Behold_ thou art fair_ my love; and again_ Behold_ thou art fair. He says this_ not to make her proud (humility is one principal ingredient in spiritual beauty)_ but,20250223
Jesus Christ takes notice what people think and speak of his church_ and is well pleased with those that honour such as fear the Lord_ and takes it ill of those that despise them_ particularly when they are under a cloud_ that offend any of his little ones.,20250223
Jesus Christ_ having espoused his church to himself (ch. iii. highly commends her beauty in the several expressions of it_ concluding her fair_ all fair_ ver. 1-5 and again_ ver. 7.,20250223

Job and God shall come together again: In my flesh shall I see God_ that is_ the glorified Redeemer_ who is God. I shall see God in my flesh (so some read it)_ the Son of God clothed with a body which will be visible even to eyes of flesh. Though the body_ in the grave_ seem despicable and miserable_ yet it shall be dignified and made happy in the vision of God. Job now complained that he could not get a sight of God (ch. xxiii. 8_ but hoped to see him shortly_ never more to lose the sight of him_ and that sight of him will be the more welcome after the present darkness and distance. Note_ It is the blessedness of the blessed that they shall see God_ shall see him as he is_ see him face to face_ and no longer through a glass darkly. See with what pleasure holy Job enlarges upon this (v. 27): __Whom I shall see for myself___ that is_ __see and enjoy_ see to my own unspeakable comfort and satisfaction. I shall see him as mine_ as mine with an appropriating sight___ Rev. xxi,20250223
Job being still silent_ Elihu follows his blow_ and here_ a third time_ undertakes to show him that he had spoken amiss_ and ought to recant. Three improper sayings he here charges him with_ and returns answer to them distinctly:—I. He had represented religion as an indifferent unprofitable thing_ which God enjoins for his own sake_ not for ours; Elihu evinces the contrary_ ver. 1-8.,20250223
Job complained much of the reproaches of his friends; but (says he) my heart shall not reproach me_ that is_ __I will never give my heart cause to reproach me_ but will keep a conscience void of offence; and_ while I do so_ I will not give my heart leave to reproach me.__ Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies. To resolve that our hearts shall not reproach us when we give them cause to do so is to affront God_ whose deputy conscience is_ and to wrong ourselves; for it is a good thing_ when a man has sinned_ to have a heart within him to smite him for it_ 2 Sam. xxiv,20250223
Job complains that he cannot understand the meaning of God's providences concerning him_ but is quite at a loss about them (v. 8_ 9): I go forward_ but he is not there_ &c. Eliphaz had bid him acquaint himself with God. __So I would_ with all my heart___ says Job_ __If I knew how to get acquainted with him.__ He had himself a great desire to appear before God_ and get a hearing of his case_ but the Judge was not to be found. Look which way he would_ he could see no sign of God's appearing for him to clear up his innocency. Job_ no doubt_ believed that God is every where present; but three things he seems to complain of here:—1. That he could not fix his thoughts_ nor form any clear judgment of things in his own mind. His mind was so hurried and discomposed with his troubles that he was like a man in a fright_ or at his wits' end_ who runs this way and that way_ but_ being in confusion_ brings nothing to a head. By reason of the disorder and tumult his spirit was in he could not fasten upon that which he knew to be in God_ and which_ if he could but have mixed faith with it and dwelt upon it in his thoughts_ would have been a support to him. It is the common complaint of those who are sick or melancholy that_ when they would think of that which is good_ they can make nothing of it,20250223
Job did not insult over his friends upon the testimony God had given concerning him_ and the submission they were obliged to make to him; but_ God being graciously reconciled to him_ he was easily reconciled to them_ and then God accepted him. This is that which we should aim at in all our prayers and services_ to be accepted of the Lord; this must be the summit of our ambition_ not to have praise of men_ but to please God.,20250223
Job does right to the divine justice in owning that he smarted for his sins and transgressions_ that he had done enough to deserve all that was laid upon him; for there was sin in all his steps_ and he was guilty of transgression enough to bring all this ruin upon him_ if it were strictly enquired into: he is far from saying that he perishes being innocent. But_ 2. He does wrong to the divine goodness in suggesting that God was extreme to mark what he did amiss_ and made the worst of every thing. He spoke to this purport_ ch. xiii,20250223
Job enquires after his sins_ and begs to have them discovered to him. He looks up to God_ and asks him what was the number of them (How many are my iniquities?) and what were the particulars of them: Make me to know my transgressions_ v,20250223
Job had asked_ long before this_ Where shall wisdom be found? Whence cometh wisdom? (Job xxviii. 12_ 20) and he had given this general answer ,20250223
Job had been a good master to them_ and did not despise their cause when they pleaded with him (ch. xxxi. and yet they were rude to him now_ and despised his cause when he pleaded with them. We must not think it strange if we receive evil at the hand of those from whom we have deserved well. Though he was now sickly_ yet he was not cross with his servants_ and imperious_ as is too common_ but he entreated his servants with his mouth_ when he had authority to command; and yet they would not be civil to him_ neither kind nor just. Note_ Those that are sick and in sorrow are apt to take things ill_ and be jealous of a slight_ and to lay to heart the least unkindness done to them: when Job was in affliction even his servants' neglect of him troubled him. ,20250223
Job had complained that God kept him wholly in the dark concerning the meaning of his dealings with him_ and therefore concluded he dealt with him as his enemy. __No___ says Elihu_ __he speaks to you_ but you do not perceive him; so that the fault is yours_ not his; and he is designing your real good even in those dispensations which you put this harsh construction upon.__ Observe in general,20250223
Job had especially complained of his sicknesses and pains; and_ as to these_ he shows largely that they were so far from being tokens of God's wrath_ as Job took them_ or evidences of Job's hypocrisy_ as his friends took them_ that they were really wise and gracious methods_ which divine grace took for the increase of his acquaintance with God_ to work patience_ experience_ and hope_ ver. 19-30. And_ lastly_ he concludes with a request to Job_ either to answer him or give him leave to go on_ ver. 31-33.,20250223
Job had largely described the prosperity of wicked people; now_ in these verses_,20250223
Job had often protested his integrity in general; here he does it in particular instances_ not in a way of commendation (for he does not here proclaim his good deeds)_ but in his own just and necessary vindication_ to clear himself from those crimes with which his friends had falsely charged him_ which is a debt every man owes to his own reputation. Job's friends had been particular in their articles of impeachment against him_ and therefore he is so in his protestation_ which seems to refer especially to what Eliphaz had accused him of_ ch. xxii. 6_ &c. They had produced no witnesses against him_ neither could they prove the things whereof they now accused him_ and therefore he may well be admitted to purge himself upon oath_ which he does very solemnly_ and with many awful imprecations of God's wrath if he were guilty of those crimes. This protestation confirms God's character of him_ that there was none like him in the earth. Perhaps some of his accusers durst not have joined with him; for he not only acquits himself from those gross sins which lie open to the eye of the world_ but from many secret sins which_ if he had been guilty of them_ nobody could have charged him_ with_ because he will prove himself no hypocrite. Nor does he only maintain the cleanness of his practices_ but shows also that in them he went upon good principles_ that the reason of his eschewing evil was because he feared God_ and his piety was at the bottom of his justice and charity; and this crowns the proof of his sincerity.,20250223
Job had silenced his three friends_ and yet could not convince them of his integrity in the main. Elihu had silenced Job_ and yet could not bring him to acknowledge his mismanagement of this dispute. But now God comes_ and does both_ convinces Job first of his unadvised speaking and makes him cry_ Peccavi—I have done wrong; and_ having humbled him_ he puts honour upon him_ by convincing his three friends that they had done him wrong. These two things God will_ sooner or later_ do for his people: he will show them their faults_ that they may be themselves ashamed of them_ and he will show others their righteousness_ and bring it forth as the light_ that they may be ashamed of their unjust censures of them,20250223
Job had sometimes complained of his friends that they were so eager in disputing that they would scarcely let him put in a word: __Suffer me that I may speak;__ and_ __O that you would hold your peace!__ But now_ it seems_ they were out of breath_ and left him room to say what he would. Either they were themselves convinced that Job was in the right or they despaired of convincing him that he was in the wrong; and therefore they threw away their weapons and gave up the cause. Job was too hard for them_ and forced them to quit the field; for great is the truth and will prevail. What Job had said (ch. xxvi.) was a sufficient answer to Bildad's discourse; and now Job paused awhile_ to see whether Zophar would take his turn again; but_ he declining it_ Job himself went on_ and_ without any interruption or vexation given him_ said all he desired to say in this matter.,20250223
Job had sometimes complained of unquiet dreams_ ch. vii,20250223
Job had spoken to this purport_ My righteousness I hold fast_ ch. xxvii,20250223
Job had such a notion of God as this_ that_ because he is in the height of heaven_ ,20250223
Job had the words of the Holy One committed to him. The people of God were at that time blessed with divine revelation,20250223
Job had turned from speaking to his friends_ finding it to no purpose to reason with them_ and here he goes on to speak to God and himself. He had reminded his friends of their frailty and mortality (ch. xiii. 12); here he reminds himself of his own_ and pleads it with God for some mitigation of his miseries. We have here an account_,20250223
Job having by his complaints in the foregoing chapter given vent to his passion_ and thereby gained some ease_ breaks them off abruptly_ and now applies himself to a further discussion of the doctrinal controversy between him and his friends concerning the prosperity of wicked people. That many live at ease who yet are ungodly and profane_ and despise all the exercises of devotion_ he had shown_ ch. xxi. Now here he goes further_ and shows that many who are mischievous to mankind_ and live in open defiance to all the laws of justice and common honesty_ yet thrive and succeed in their unrighteous practices; and we do not see them reckoned with in this world. What he had said before (ch. xii.,20250223
Job having solemnly protested the satisfaction he had in his integrity_ for the further clearing of himself_ here expresses the dread he had of being found a hypocrite.,20250223
Job having warmly given vent to his passion_ and so broken the ice_ his friends here come gravely to give vent to their judgment upon his case_ which perhaps they had communicated to one another apart_ compared notes upon it and talked it over among themselves_ and found they were all agreed in their verdict_ that Job's afflictions certainly proved him to be a hypocrite; but they did not attack Job with this high charge till by the expressions of his discontent and impatience_ in which they thought he reflected on God himself_ he had confirmed them in the bad opinion they had before conceived of him and his character. Now they set upon him with great fear. The dispute begins_ and it soon becomes fierce. The opponents are Job's three friends. Job himself is respondent. Elihu appears_ first_ as moderator_ and at length God himself gives judgment upon the controversy and the management of it. The question in dispute is whether Job was an honest man or no_ the same question that was in dispute between God and Satan in the first two chapters. Satan had yielded it_ and durst not pretend that his cursing his day was a constructive cursing of his God; no_ he cannot deny but that Job still holds fast his integrity; but Job's friends will needs have it that_ if Job were an honest man_ he would not have been thus sorely and thus tediously afflicted_ and therefore urge him to confess himself a hypocrite in the profession he had made of religion: __No___ says Job_ __that I will never do; I have offended God_ but my heart_ notwithstanding_ has been upright with him;__ and still he holds fast the comfort of his integrity. Eliphaz_ who_ it is likely_ was the senior_ or of the best quality_ begins with him in this chapter_ in which_,20250223
Job here backs all he had said in maintenance of his own integrity with a solemn oath_ to silence contradiction_ and take the blame entirely upon himself if he prevaricated. Observe_,20250223
Job here comes to make application of what he had said in the foregoing chapter; and now we have him not in so good a temper as he was in then: for_,20250223
Job here frets himself with thinking that if he had but died as soon as he was born_ and been carried from the womb to the grave,20250223
Job here grows more and more querulous_ and does not conclude this chapter with such reverent expressions of God's wisdom and justice as he began with. Those that indulge a complaining humour know not to what indecencies_ nay_ to what impieties_ it will hurry them. The beginning of that strife with God is as the letting forth of water; therefore leave it off before it be meddled with. When we are in trouble we are allowed to complain to God_ as the Psalmist often_ but must by no means complain of God_ as Job here.,20250223
Job here owns his judgment convinced of the greatness_ glory_ and perfection of God_ from which would follow the conviction of his conscience concerning his own folly in speaking irreverently to him.,20250223
Job here reasons with God_,20250223
Job here recommends himself_ both his case and his discourse_ both what he suffered and what he said_ to the compassionate consideration of his friends. 1. That which he entreats of them is very fair_ that they would suffer him to speak (v. 3) and not break in upon him_ as Zophar had done_ in the midst of his discourse. Losers_ of all men_ may have leave to speak; and_ if those that are accused and censured are not allowed to speak for themselves_ they are wronged without remedy_ and have no way to come at their right. He entreats that they would hear diligently his speech (v. 2) as those that were willing to understand him_ and_ if they were under a mistake_ to have it rectified; and that they would mark him (v. for we may as well not hear as not heed and observe what we hear,20250223
Job here returns to his complaints; and_ though he is not without hope of future bliss_ he finds it very hard to get over his present grievances.,20250223
Job here says the same that Eliphaz had said (ch. v. and in the original in the very same words_ not declining to speak after him_ though now his antagonist. God is a great God_ and doeth great things_ a wonder-working God; his works of wonder are so many that we cannot number them and so mysterious that we cannot find them out. O the depth of his counsels!,20250223
Job here takes fresh hold_ fast hold_ of his integrity_ as one that was resolved not to let it go_ nor suffer it to be wrested from him. His firmness in this matter is commendable and his warmth excusable.,20250223
Job here tells him there were those that were really guilty of those crimes with which he was unjustly charged and yet prospered and had success in their villanies_ the curse they laid themselves under working invisibly; and Job thinks it more just to argue as he did_ from an open notorious course of wickedness inferring a secret and future punishment_ than to argue as Eliphaz did_ who from nothing but present trouble inferred a course of past secret iniquity. The impunity of these oppressors and spoilers is expressed in one word (v. 12): Yet God layeth not folly to them_ that is_ he does not immediately prosecute them with his judgments for these crimes_ nor make them examples_ and so evince their folly to all the world. He that gets riches_ and not by right_ at his end shall be a fool_ Jer. xvii,20250223
Job here thinks of dying_ and of getting ready for death_ and therefore resolves never to part with his religion_ though he had lost all he had in the world. Note_ The best preparative for death is perseverance to death in our integrity. __Until I die___ that is_ __though I die by this affliction_ I will not thereby be put out of conceit with my God and my religion. Though he slay me_ yet will I trust in him.__ 2. He would always stand to it that he was an honest man; he would not remove_ he would not part with_ the conscience_ and comfort_ and credit of his integrity; he was resolved to defend it to the last. __God knows_ and my own heart knows_ that I always meant well_ and did not allow myself in the omission of any known duty or the commission of any known sin. This is my rejoicing_ and no man shall rob me of it; I will never lie against my right.__ It has often been the lot of upright men to be censured and condemned as hypocrites; but it well becomes them to bear up boldly against such censures_ and not to be discouraged by them nor think the worse of themselves for them; as the apostle (Heb. xiii. 18): We have a good conscience in all things_ willing to live honestly.,20250223
Job here warmly expresses his resentment of the unkindness of his friends.,20250223
Job here_ in the conclusion of his discourse_,20250223
Job is confident that he has wrong done him by his friends_ and therefore_ ill as he is_ he will not give up the cause_ nor let them have the last word. Here_,20250223
Job is here excusing what he could not justify_ even his inordinate desire of death. Why should he not wish for the termination of life_ which would be the termination of his miseries? To enforce this reason he argues_,20250223
Job is without knowledge and wisdom; but_ in this matter_ he has spoken without knowledge_ and_ whatever his heart is_ his words were without prudence. What he said to his wife may be retorted upon himself (He speaks as one of the foolish men speak) and for the same reason_ Shall we not receive evil as well as good at God's hand? ch. ii,20250223
Job makes no answer to that_ though it would have been easy enough to retort it upon himself; but in what he next lays down as his principle_ that God never perverts judgment_ Job agrees with him: I know it is so of a truth_ v.,20250223
Job owns here that he was full of confusion (ver. and as he was so was his discourse: he knew not what to say_ and perhaps sometimes scarcely knew what he said. In this chapter_,20250223
Job prayed for his friends_ and then they flocked about him_ overcome by his kindness_ and every one desiring an interest in his prayers. The more we pray for our friends and relations the more comfort we may expect in them.,20250223
Job readily owned that God did not pervert judgment; and yet it did not therefore follow either that his children were cast-aways or that they died for some great transgression. It is true that we and our children have sinned against God_ and we ought to justify him in all he brings upon us and ours; but extraordinary afflictions are not always the punishment of extraordinary sins_ but sometimes the trial of extraordinary graces; and_ in our judgment of another's case (unless the contrary appears)_ we ought to take the more favourable side_ as our Saviour directs_ Luke xiii. 2-4. Here Bildad missed it.,20250223
Job reflects upon the harsh censures which his friends had passed upon him_ and looking upon himself as a dying man (ver. 1)_ he appeals to God_ and begs of him speedily to appear for him_ and right him_ because they had wronged him_ and he knew not how to right himself_ ver. 2-7. But he hopes that_ though it should be a surprise_ it will be no stumbling-block_ to good people_ to see him thus abused_ ver. 8_ 9.,20250223
Job submits in a humble silence_ ver. 3-5.,20250223
Job was greatly humbled for what God had already said_ but not sufficiently; he was brought low_ but not low enough; and therefore God here proceeds to reason with him in the same manner and to the same purport as before_ v,20250223
Job was not only so rich and great_ but withal so wise and good_ and had such an interest both in heaven and earth_ that one would think the mountain of his prosperity stood so strong that it could not be moved; but here we have a thick cloud gathering over his head_ pregnant with a horrible tempest. We must never think ourselves secure from storms while we are in this lower region. Before we are told how his troubles surprised and seized him here in this visible world_ we are here told how they were concerted in the world of spirits_ that the devil_ having a great enmity to Job for his eminent piety_ begged and obtained leave to torment him. It does not at all derogate from the credibility of Job's story in general to allow that this discourse between God and Satan_ in these verses_ is parabolical_ like that of Micaiah (1 Kings xxii. 19_ &c.)_ and an allegory designed to represent the malice of the devil against good men and the divine check and restraint which that malice is under; only thus much further is intimated_ that the affairs of this earth are very much the subject of the counsels of the unseen world. That world is dark to us_ but we lie very open to it. Now here we have_,20250223
Job was now full of confusion (ch. x. while he looked upon God as his enemy and quarrelled with him; but Zophar assures him that_ if he would submit and humble himself_ his mind would be composed_ and he would be freed from those frightful apprehensions he had of God_ which put him into such an agitation. The less we are frightened the more we are fixed_ and consequently the more fit we are for our services and for our sufferings.,20250223
Job was perhaps_ in his own mind_ ready to reproach the Sabeans_ and fly out against them for their injustice and cruelty_ when the next news immediately directs him to look upwards: The fire of God has fallen from heaven. As thunder is his voice_ so lightning is his fire: but this was such an extraordinary lightning_ and levelled so directly against Job_ that all his sheep and shepherds were not only killed_ but consumed by it at once_ and one shepherd only was left alive to carry the news to poor Job. The devil_ aiming to make him curse God and renounce his religion_ managed this part of the trial very artfully_ in order thereto. ,20250223

Job's complaint is here as bitter as any where in all his discourses_ and he is at a stand whether to smother it or to give it vent. Sometimes the one and sometimes the other is a relief to the afflicted_ according as the temper or the circumstances are; but Job found help by neither_ v,20250223
Job's condition was very deplorable; but had he nothing to support him_ nothing to comfort him? Yes_ and he here tells us what it was.,20250223
Job's discourse here is called a parable (mashal)_ the title of Solomon's proverbs_ because it was grave and weighty_ and very instructive_ and he spoke as one having authority. It comes from a word that signifies to rule_ or have dominion; and some think it intimates that Job now triumphed over his opponents_ and spoke as one that had baffled them. We say of an excellent preacher that he knows how dominari in concionibus—to command his hearers. Job did so here. A long strife there had been between Job and his friends; they seemed disposed to have the matter compromised; and therefore_ since an oath for confirmation is an end of strife (Heb. vi.,20250223
Job's discourse is here somewhat broken and interrupted_ and he passes suddenly from one thing to another_ as is usual with men in trouble; but we may reduce what is here said to three heads:—,20250223
Job's friends all of them went upon this principle_ that wicked people cannot prosper long in this world_ but some remarkable judgment or other will suddenly light on them: Zophar had concluded with it_ that the eyes of the wicked shall fail_ ch. xi,20250223
Job's friends are like Job's messengers: the latter followed one another close with evil tidings_ the former followed him with harsh censures: both_ unawares_ served Satan's design; these to drive him from his integrity_ those to drive him from the comfort of it. Eliphaz did not reply to what Job had said in answer to him_ but left it to Bildad_ whom he knew to be of the same mind with himself in this affair. Those are not the wisest of the company_ but the weakest rather_ who covet to have all the talk. Let others speak in their turn_ and let the first keep silence_ 1 Cor. xiv. 30_ 31. Eliphaz had undertaken to show that because Job was sorely afflicted he was certainly a wicked man. Bildad is much of the same mind_ and will conclude Job a wicked man unless God do speedily appear for his relief. In this chapter he endeavours to convince Job_,20250223
Job's friends had been very positive in it that they should soon see the fall of wicked people_ how much soever they might prosper for a while. By no means_ says Job; though times are not hidden from the Almighty_ yet those that know him do not presently see his day_ v. 1. 1. He takes it for granted that times are not hidden from the Almighty; past times are not hidden from his judgment (Eccl. iii. present times are not hidden from his providence (Matt. x. future times are not hidden from his prescience_ Acts xv,20250223
Job's friends had often put their severe censure of Job upon this issue_ If thou wert pure and upright_ surely now he would awake for thee_ ch. viii,20250223
Job's friends had passed a very severe censure upon him as a wicked man because he was so grievously afflicted; now here he tells them how ill he took it to be so censured. Bildad had twice begun with a How long (ch. viii. 2_ xviii.,20250223
Job's friends had pretended to comfort him with the hopes of his return to a prosperous estate again; now he here shows_,20250223
Job's friends had seen a great deal of the misery and destruction that attend wicked people_ especially oppressors; and Job_ while the heat of disputation lasted_ had said as much_ and with as much assurance_ of their prosperity; but now that the heat of the battle was nearly over he was willing to own how far he agreed with them_ and where the difference between his opinion and theirs lay. 1. He agreed with them that wicked people are miserable people_ that God will surely reckon with cruel oppressors_ and one time or other_ one way or other_ his justice will make reprisals upon them for all the affronts they have put upon God and all the wrongs they have done to their neighbours. This truth is abundantly confirmed by the entire concurrence even of these angry disputants in it. But_ 2. In this they differed—they held that these deserved judgments are presently and visibly brought upon wicked oppressors_ that they travail with pain all their days_ that in prosperity the destroyer comes upon them_ that they shall not be rich_ nor their branch green_ and that their destruction shall be accomplished before their time (so Eliphaz_ ch. xv. 20_ 21_ 29_ that the steps of their strength shall be straitened_ that terrors shall make them afraid on every side (so Bildad_ ch. xviii. 7_ that he himself shall vomit up his riches_ and that in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits_ so Zophar_ ch. xx. 15_ 22. Now Job held that_ in many cases_ judgments do not fall upon them quickly_ but are deferred for some time. That vengeance strikes slowly he had already shown (ch. xxi. and xxiv.); now he comes to show that it strikes surely and severely_ and that reprieves are no pardons.,20250223
Job's humble requests. He prays,20250223
Job's humble submission thereupon. Now Job came to himself_ and began to melt into godly sorrow. When his friends reasoned with him he did not yield; but the voice of the Lord is powerful. When the Spirit of truth shall come_ he shall convince. They had condemned him for a wicked man; Elihu himself had been very sharp upon him (ch. xxxiv. 7_ 8_ 37); but God had not given him such hard words. We may sometimes have reason to expect better treatment from God_ and a more candid construction of what we do_ than we meet with from our friends. This the good man is here overcome by_ and yields himself a conquered captive to the grace of God. 1. He owns himself an offender_ and has nothing to say in his own justification (v. 4): __Behold_ I am vile_ not only mean and contemptible_ but vile and abominable_ in my own eyes.__ He is now sensible that he has sinned_ and therefore calls himself vile. Sin debases us_ and penitents abase themselves_ reproach themselves_ are ashamed_ yea_ even confounded. __I have acted undutifully to my Father_ ungratefully to my benefactor_ unwisely for myself; and therefore I am vile.__ Job now vilifies himself as much as ever he had justified and magnified himself. Repentance changes men's opinion of themselves. Job had been too bold in demanding a conference with God_ and thought he could make his part good with him: but now he is convinced of his error_ and owns himself utterly unable to stand before God or to produce any thing worth his notice_ the veriest dunghill-worm that ever crawled upon God's ground. While his friends talked with him_ he answered them_ for he thought himself as good as they; but_ when God talked with him_ he had nothing to say_ for_ in comparison with him_ he sees himself nothing_ less than nothing_ worse than nothing_ vanity and vileness itself; and therefore_ What shall I answer thee? God demanded an answer_ v,20250223
Job's prosperity was now at an end_ and so has the prosperity of other wicked people quickly been. ,20250223
Job's was so. The hungry robbers_ the Sabeans and Chaldeans_ ran away with it_ and swallowed it; and this_ says he_ I have often observed in others. What has been got by spoil and rapine has been lost in the same way. The careful owner hedged it about with thorns_ and then thought it safe; but the fence proved insignificant against the greediness of the spoilers (if hunger will break through the stone walls_ much more through thorn hedges)_ and against the divine curse_ which will go through the thorns and briers_ and burn them together_ Isa. xxvii. 4.,20250223
Job_ finding it to no purpose to wish either that he had not been born or had died as soon as he was born_ here complains that his life was now continued and not cut off. When men are set on quarrelling there is no end of it; the corrupt heart will carry on the humour. Having cursed the day of his birth_ here he courts the day of his death. The beginning of this strife and impatience is as the letting forth of water.,20250223
Job_ having spoken of the wealth of the world_ which men put such a value upon and take so much pains for_ here comes to speak of another more valuable jewel_ and that is_ wisdom and understanding_ the knowing and enjoying of God and ourselves. Those that found out all those ways and means to enrich themselves thought themselves very wise; but Job will not own theirs to be wisdom. He supposes them to gain their point_ and to bring to light what they sought for (v. and yet asks_ __Where is wisdom? for it is not here.__ This their way is their folly. We must therefore seek it somewhere else_ and it will be found nowhere but in the principles and practices of religion. There is more true knowledge_ satisfaction_ and happiness_ in sound divinity_ which shows us the way to the joys of heaven_ than in natural philosophy or mathematics_ which help us to find a way into the bowels of the earth. Two things cannot be found out concerning this wisdom:—,20250223
Job_ in his discourses_ had complained very much of the censures of his friends and their hard usage of him_ and had appealed to God as Judge between him and them_ and thought it hard that judgment was not immediately given upon the appeal. While God was catechising Job out of the whirlwind one would have thought that he only was in the wrong_ and that the cause would certainly go against him; but here_ to our great surprise_ we find it quite otherwise_ and the definitive sentence given in Job's favour. Wherefore judge nothing before the time. Those who are truly righteous before God may have their righteousness clouded and eclipsed by great and uncommon afflictions_ by the severe censures of men_ by their own frailties and foolish passions_ by the sharp reproofs of the word and conscience_ and the deep humiliation of their own spirits under the sense of God's terrors; and yet_ in due time_ these clouds shall all blow over_ and God will bring forth their righteousness as the light and their judgment as the noon-day_ Ps. xxxvii,20250223
Job_ in his prosperity_ was noted for good house-keeping: He opened his door to the road (so it may be read); he kept the street-door open_ that he might see who passed by and invite them in_ as Abraham_ Gen. xviii. 1.,20250223
Job_ in this chapter_ goes on to express the bitter sense he had of his calamities and to justify himself in his desire of death.,20250223
Job_ like Abraham_ had an altar for his family_ on which_ it is likely_ he offered sacrifice daily; but_ on this extraordinary occasion_ he offered more sacrifices than usual_ and with more solemnity_ according to the number of them all_ one for each child. Parents should be particular in their addresses to God for the several branches of their family. __For this child I prayed_ according to its particular temper_ genius_ and condition___ to which the prayers_ as well as the endeavours_ must be accommodated. When these sacrifices were to be offered_ ,20250223
Job_ observing perhaps that his friends_ though they would not interrupt him in his discourse_ yet began to grow weary_ and not to heed much what he said_ here turns to God_ and speaks to him. If men will not hear us_ God will; if men cannot help us_ he can; for his arm is not shortened_ neither is his ear heavy. Yet we must not go to school to Job here to learn how to speak to God; for_ it must be confessed_ there is a great mixture of passion and corruption in what he here says. But_ if God be not extreme to mark what his people say amiss_ let us also make the best of it. Job is here begging of God either to ease him or to end him. He here represents himself to God_,20250223
Job_ perhaps reflecting upon himself for his folly in wishing he had never been born_ follows it_ and thinks to mend it_ with another_ little better_ that he had died as soon as he was born_ which he enlarges upon in these verses. When our Saviour would set forth a very calamitous state of things he seems to allow such a saying as this_ Blessed are the barren_ and the wombs that never bore_ and the paps which never gave suck (Luke xxiii. 29); but blessing the barren womb is one thing and cursing the fruitful womb is another! It is good to make the best of afflictions_ but it is not good to make the worst of mercies. Our rule is_ Bless_ and curse not. Life is often put for all good_ and death for all evil; yet Job here very absurdly complains of life and its supports as a curse and plague to him_ and covets death and the grave as the greatest and most desirable bliss. Surely Satan was deceived in Job when he applied that maxim to him_ All that a man hath will he give for his life; for never any man valued life at a lower rate than he did.,20250223

Justice_ reigning in a nation_ puts an honour upon it. A righteous administration of the government_ impartial equity between man and man_ public countenance given to religion_ the general practice and profession of virtue_ the protecting and preserving of virtuous men_ charity and compassion to strangers (alms are sometimes called righteousness)_ these exalt a nation; they uphold the throne_ elevate the people's minds_ and qualify a nation for the favour of God_ which will make them high_ as a holy nation_ Deut. xxvi. 19,20250223

Keep thy thoughts from roving and wandering from the work; keep thy affections from running out towards wrong objects_ for in the business of God's house there is work enough for the whole man_ and all too little to be employed.__ Some think it alludes to the charge given to Moses and Joshua to put off their shoes (Exod. iii. 5_ Josh. v. 15_) in token of subjection and reverence. Keep thy feet clean_ Exod. xxx. 19.,20250223
Kingdoms have their ebbings and flowings_ their waxings and wanings; and both are from God,20250223
Kings play the madmen_ and their people suffer for it_ so the government sometimes suffers for the sins of the people,20250223

Knavery is the way to slavery: The slothful and careless_ or rather the deceitful (for so the word signifies)_ shall be under tribute. Those that_ because they will not take pains in an honest calling_ live by their shifts and arts of dishonesty_ are paltry and beggarly_ and will be kept under. Those that are diligent and honest when they are apprentices will come to be masters; but those that are otherwise are the fools who_ all their days_ must be servants to the wise in heart.,20250223

Let all that would receive instruction come with the disposition of children_ though they be grown persons. Let all prejudices be laid aside_ and the mind be as white paper. let them be dutiful_ tractable_ and self-diffident_ and take the word as the word of a father_ which comes both with authority and with affection. We must see it coming from God as our Father in heaven_ to whom we pray_ from whom we expect blessings_ the Father of our spirits_ to whom we ought to be in subjection_ that we may live. We must look upon our teachers as our fathers_ who love us and seek our welfare; and therefore though the instruction carry in it reproof and correction_ for so the word signifies_ yet we must bid it welcome. Now_ ,20250223
Let all young people_ in the days of their childhood and youth_ take pains to get knowledge and grace_ for that is their learning age_ and then their minds are formed and seasoned. He does not say_ My children_ but You children. We read but of one son that Solomon had of his own; but (would you think it?) he is willing to set up for a schoolmaster_ and to teach other people's children! for at that age there is most hope of success; the branch is easily bent when it is young and tender,20250223
Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. 6 As for that night_ let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year_ let it not come into the number of the months.,20250223
Let him not get nor keep any thing but what he can rejoice in. See 2 Cor. i. 12.,20250223
Let inferiors be admonished_ not only to submit to instruction and reproof (even hardships must be submitted to)_ but to value them as favours and not despise them_ to make use of them for their direction_ and always to have a regard to them; this will be an evidence that they are wise and a means of making them so; whereas he that slights his good education is a fool and is likely to live and die one.,20250223
Let me be weighed in an even balance_ that God may know mine integrity. 7 If my step hath turned out of the way_ and mine heart walked after mine eyes_ and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands,20250223
Let my friends put what construction they please upon it_ and think the worse of me for it; I hope God will not make my necessary defence to be my offence_ as you do. He will justify me (v. 18) and then nothing can come amiss to me.__ Note_ Those that are upright_ and have the assurance of their uprightness_ may cheerfully welcome every event. Come what will_ bene præparatum pectus—they are ready for it. He resolves (v. 15) that he will maintain his own ways. He would never part with the satisfaction he had in having walked uprightly with God; for_ though he could not justify every word he had spoken_ yet_ in the general_ his ways were good_ and he would maintain his uprightness; and why should he not_ since that was his great support under his present exercises_ as it was Hezekiah's_ Now_ Lord_ remember how I have walked before thee? Nay_ he would not only not betray his own cause_ or give it up_ but he would openly avow his sincerity; for (v. 19) __If hold my tongue_ and do not speak for myself_ my silence now will for ever silence me_ for I shall certainly give up the ghost___ v,20250223
Let not subjects commence a quarrel with their prince_ though the public administration be not in every thing as they would have it. He grants there is an evil often seen under the sun_ and it is a king's-evil_ an evil which the king only can cure_ for it is an error which proceeds from the ruler (v. 5); it is a mistake which rulers_ consulting their personal affections more than the public interests_ are too often guilty of_ that men are not preferred according to their merit_ but folly is set in great dignity_ men of shattered brains_ and broken fortunes_ are put in places of power and trust_ while the rich men of good sense and good estates_ whose interest would oblige them to be true to the public_ and whose abundance would be likely to set them above temptations to bribery and extortion_ yet sit in low places_ and can get no preferment (v. either the ruler knows not how to value them or the terms of preferment are such as they cannot in conscience comply with. It is ill with a people when vicious men are advanced and men of worth are kept under hatches. This is illustrated v,20250223

Let not young people despise the old_ for they are grave_ and fit for counsel_ and_ though they have not the strength that young men have_ yet they have more wisdom and experience. Juniores ad labores_ seniores ad honores—Labour is for the young_ honour for the aged. God has put honour upon the old man; for his gray head is his beauty. See Dan. vii. 9.,20250223
Let old people be old disciples; let them persevere to the end in the way of righteousness_ which they long since set out in_ that they may then be found in it,20250223
Let our disappointments in the creature turn our eyes to the Creator; let us have recourse to the word of God's grace and consult that_ to the throne of his grace and solicit that. In the word and prayer there is a balm for every wound.,20250223
Let subjects see to it that they do not find fault with the government for doing its duty_ for it is a wicked thing to strike princes for equity_ by defaming their administration or by any secret attempts against them to strike at them_ as the ten tribes that revolted reflected upon Solomon for imposing necessary taxes. Some read it_ Nor to strike the ingenuous for equity. Magistrates must take heed that none suffer under them for well doing; nor must parents provoke their children to wrath by unjust rebukes.,20250223
Let superiors be admonished to give instruction and reproof to those that are under their charge_ as they will answer it in the day of account. They must not only instruct with the light of knowledge_ but reprove with the heat of zeal; and both these must be done with the authority and affection of a father_ and must be continued_ though the desired effect be not immediately perceived. If the instruction be despised_ give reproof_ and rebuke sharply. It is indeed against the grain with good-humoured men to find fault_ and make those about them uneasy; but better so than to suffer them to go on undisturbed in the way to ruin,20250223
Let that be avoided which will be thus rued at last.,20250223

Let them seek wisdom_ and they shall find it; let them ask_ and it shall be given them_ v. 7_ 8. Observe here_,20250223
Let them take care that their bodies be not defiled by intemperance_ uncleanness_ or any fleshly lusts: __Put away evil from the flesh_ and let not the members of thy body be instruments of unrighteousness. The evil of sin will be the evil of punishment_ and that which thou art fond of_ as good for the flesh_ because it gratifies the appetites of it_ will prove evil_ and hurtful to it_ and therefore put it far from thee_ the further the better.__,20250223
Let them take care that their minds be not lifted up with pride_ nor disturbed with anger_ or any sinful passion: Remove sorrow_ or anger_ from thy heart; the word signifies any disorder or perturbation of the mind. Young people are apt to be impatient of check and control_ to vex and fret at any thing that is humbling and mortifying to them_ and their proud hearts rise against every thing that crosses and contradicts them. They are so set upon that which is pleasing to sense that they cannot bear any thing that is displeasing_ but it goes with sorrow to their heart. Their pride often disquiets them_ and makes them uneasy. __Put that away_ and the love of the world_ and lay thy expectations low from the creature_ and then disappointments will not be occasions of sorrow and anger to thee.__ Some by sorrow here understand that carnal mirth described v. 9_ the end of which will be bitterness and sorrow. Let them keep at a distance from every thing which will be sorrow in the reflection.,20250223
Let this make good people willing to die; it is but going to bed; they are weary and sleepy_ and it is time that they were in their beds. Why should they not go willingly_ when their father calls? __Nay_ I have made my bed_ by preparation for it_ have endeavoured to make it easy_ by keeping conscience pure_ by seeing Christ lying in this bed_ and so turning it into a bed of spices_ and by looking beyond it to the resurrection.__ ,20250223
Let this reconcile God's children to their troubles; they are but trials_ designed for their honour and benefit_ and_ if God be pleased with them_ let not them be displeased; if he laugh at the trial of the innocent_ knowing how glorious the issue of it will be_ at destruction and famine let them also laugh (ch. v. and triumph over them_ saying_ O death! where is thy sting? On the other hand_ the wicked are so far from being made the marks of God's judgments that the earth is given into their hand_ v. 24 (they enjoy large possessions and great power_ have what they will and do what they will)_ into the hand of the wicked one (in the original_ the word is singular); the devil_ that wicked one_ is called the god of this world_ and boasts that into his hands it is delivered_ Luke,20250223

Life_ and all its comforts_ will not entice a believer from loving Christ: If a man could hire him with all the substance of his house_ to take his love off from Christ and set it upon the world and the flesh again_ he would reject the proposal with the utmost disdain; as Christ_ when the kingdoms of this world and the glory of them were offered him_ to buy him off from his undertaking_ said_ Get thee hence_ Satan. It would utterly be contemned. Offer those things to those that know no better. Love will enable us to repel and triumph over temptations from the smiles of the world_ as much as from its frowns. Some give this sense of it: If a man would give all the substance of his house to Christ_ as an equivalent instead of love_ to excuse it_ it would be contemned. He seeks not ours_ but us_ the heart_ not the wealth. If I give all my goods to feed the poor_ and have not love_ it is nothing_ 1 Cor.,20250223
Like as when men are wounded (so the margin reads it); they pretend to be very much affected with the miscarriages of such and such_ and to be in pain for them_ and pretend that it is with the greatest grief and reluctance imaginable that they speak of them. They look as if they themselves were wounded by it_ whereas really they rejoice in iniquity_ are fond of the story_ and tell it with pride and pleasure. Thus their words seem; but they go down as poison into the innermost parts of the belly_ the pill being thus gilded_ thus sugared,20250223

Live a cheerful life. If God have prospered the work of our hands unto us_ let us rejoice in it_ and take the comfort of it_ and not make it a burden to ourselves and leave others the joy of it; for that is our portion_ not the portion of our souls (miserable are those that have their portion in this life_ Ps. xvii. 14_ and fools are those that choose it and take up with it_ Luke xii. but it is the portion of the body; that only which we enjoy is ours out of this world; it is taking what is to be had and making the best of it_ and the reason is because none can give us a sight of what shall be after us_ either who shall have our estates or what use they will make of them. When we are gone it is likely we shall not see what is after us; there is no correspondence that we know of between the other world and this_ Job xiv,20250223
Lo_ I come_ to which their faith here affixes its seal: Behold_ he comes as he has promised. ,20250223
Long was Job's heart hot within him; and_ while he was musing_ the fire burned_ and the more for being stifled and suppressed. At length he spoke with his tongue_ but not such a good word as David spoke after a long pause: Lord_ make me to know my end_ Ps. xxxix. 3_ 4. Seven days the prophet Ezekiel sat down astonished with the captives_ and then (probably on the sabbath day) the word of the Lord came to him_ Ezek. iii. 15_ 16. So long Job and his friends sat thinking_ but said nothing; they were afraid of speaking what they thought_ lest they should grieve him_ and he durst not give vent to his thoughts_ lest he should offend them. They came to comfort him_ but_ finding his afflictions very extraordinary_ they began to think comfort did not belong to him_ suspecting him to be a hypocrite_ and therefore they said nothing. But losers think they may have leave to speak_ and therefore Job first gives vent to his thoughts. Unless they had been better_ it would however have been well if he had kept them to himself. In short_ he cursed his day_ the day of his birth_ wished he had never been born_ could not think or speak of his own birth without regret and vexation. Whereas men usually observe the annual return of their birth-day with rejoicing_ he looked upon it as the unhappiest day of the year_ because the unhappiest of his life_ being the inlet into all his woe.

Malicious men are justly dreaded and detested_ for they are much more dangerous and mischievous to all societies: A man of wicked devices_ who stifles his resentments till he has an opportunity of being revenged_ and is secretly plotting how to wrong his neighbour and to do him an ill turn_ as Cain to kill Abel_ such a man as this is hated by all mankind. The character of an angry man is pitiable; through the surprise of a temptation he disturbs and disgraces himself_ but it is soon over_ and he is sorry for it. But that of a spiteful revengeful man is odious; there is no fence against him nor cure for him.,20250223
Man calleth thee his wealth_ who made thee rich_ And while he digs out thee falls in the ditch.,20250223

Man is a strange sort of creature_ a ray of heaven united to a clod of earth; at death these are separated_ and each goes to the place whence it came. First_ The body_ that clod of clay_ returns to its own earth. It is made of the earth; Adam's body was so_ and we are of the same mould; it is a house of clay. At death it is laid in the earth_ and in a little time will be resolved into earth_ not to be distinguished from common earth_ according to the sentence (Gen. iii.,20250223
Man is here represented to us,20250223
Man is wholly ignorant of the time when they bring forth_ v. 1_ 2. Shall we pretend to tell what is in the womb of Providence_ or what a day will bring forth_ who know not the time of the pregnancy of a hind or a wild goat? ,20250223
Man purposes. He has a freedom of thought and a freedom of will permitted him; let him form his projects_ and lay his schemes_ as he thinks best: but_ after all_ 2. God disposes. Man cannot go on with his business without the assistance and blessing of God_ who made man's mouth and teaches us what we shall say. Nay_ God easily can_ and often does_ cross men's purposes_ and break their measures. It was a curse that was prepared in Balaam's heart_ but the answer of the tongue was a blessing.,20250223
Man's Ignorance of the Animal Creation; Description of the Wild Goat_ Hind_ Wild Ass_ and Unicorn. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Man's great wickedness_ his neglect of God's favour and his own interest_ which is very absurd and unaccountable: He has no heart to it_ not to the wisdom that is to be got_ nor to the price in the use of which it may be got. He has no heart_ no skill_ nor will_ nor courage_ to improve his advantages. He has set his heart upon other things_ so that he has no heart to his duty or the great concerns of his soul. Wherefore should a price be thrown away and lost upon one so undeserving of it?,20250223
Man's present place. He is upon earth_ which God has given to the children of men_ Ps. cxv,20250223
Man_ by reason of his actual transgressions_ is obnoxious to God's justice and cannot in himself be justified before him: he can neither plead Not guilty_ nor plead any merit of his own to balance or extenuate his guilt. The scripture has concluded all under sin. ,20250223
Man_ by reason of his original corruption_ as he is born of a woman_ is odious to God's holiness_ and cannot be clean in his sight. God sees his impurity_ and it is certain that by it he is rendered utterly unfit for communion and fellowship with God in grace here and for the vision and fruition of him in glory hereafter. We have need therefore to be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost_ and to be bathed again and again in the blood of Christ_ that fountain opened.,20250223
Man_ in his fallen state_ cannot pretend to be clean and righteous before God_ either to acquit himself to God's justice or recommend himself to his favour,20250223
Many a family is brought to ruin by ill housewifery_ as well as by ill husbandry. A foolish woman_ that has no fear of God nor regard to her business_ that is wilful_ and wasteful_ and humoursome_ that indulges her ease and appetite_ and is all for jaunting and feasting_ cards and the play-house_ though she come to a plentiful estate_ and to a family beforehand_ she will impoverish and waste it_ and will as certainly be the ruin of her house as if she plucked it down with her hands; and the husband himself_ with all his care_ can scarcely prevent it.,20250223
Many a good word they said of him_ and many a good prayer they put up for him. He did not think it an honour to make every body fear him (Oderint dum metuant—Let them hate_ provided they also fear) nor to be arbitrary_ and to have his own will and way_ not caring what people said of him; but_ like Mordecai_ to be accepted of the multitude of his brethren_ Esth. x,20250223
Many a man has been sunk by having his own tongue fall upon him_ Ps. lxiv,20250223
Many a man is buried alive in poverty and obscurity who_ if he had but fit encouragement given him_ might be a great blessing to the world; many a pearl is lost in its shell. But there is a day coming when wisdom and goodness shall be in honour_ and the righteous shall shine forth.,20250223
Many a man needs no more to sink him than for his own tongue to fall upon him.,20250223
Many are hindered from being truly wise and religious by a false and groundless conceit that they are so_ John ix. 40_ 41.,20250223
Many enjoy a secret pleasure_ especially in divine consolations_ which others are not aware of_ much less are sharers in; and_ as the sorrows of a penitent_ so the joys of a believer are such as a stranger does not intermeddle with and therefore is no competent judge of.,20250223
Many humbling confounding questions God had put to Job_ in the foregoing chapter; now_ in this chapter_,20250223
Many men's honesty is owing purely to their impotency; they do not do wrong because they cannot support it when it is done_ or it is not in their power to do it. But God is able to crush any man easily and suddenly_ and yet does not by arbitrary power crush any man_ which therefore must be attributed to the infinite perfection of his nature_ and that is immutable. See here_ ,20250223
Many need severe rebukes. Some children are so obstinate that their parents can do no good with them without sharp correction; some criminals must feel the rigour of the law and public justice; gentle methods will not work upon them; they must be beaten black and blue. And the wise God sees that his own children sometimes need very sharp afflictions,20250223
Many that would be very well pleased to hear the information of the wise_ and much more to have their commendations and consolations_ yet do not care for hearing their rebukes_ that is_ care not for being told of their faults_ though ever so wisely; but therein they are no friends to themselves_ for reproofs of instruction are the way of life (Prov. and_ though they be not so pleasant as the song of fools_ they are more wholesome. To hear_ not only with patience_ but with pleasure_ the rebuke of the wise_ is a sign and means of wisdom; but to be fond of the song of fools is a sign that the mind is vain and is the way to make it more so. And what an absurd thing is it for a man to dote so much upon such a transient pleasure as the laughter of a fool is_ which may fitly be compared to the burning of thorns under a pot_ which makes a great noise and a great blaze_ for a little while_ but is gone presently_ scatters its ashes_ and contributes scarcely any thing to the production of a boiling heat_ for that requires a constant fire! The laughter of a fool is noisy and flashy_ and is not an instance of true joy. This is also vanity; it deceives men to their destruction_ for the end of that mirth is heaviness. Our blessed Saviour has read us our doom: Blessed are you that weep now_ for you shall laugh; woe to you that laugh now_ for you shall mourn and weep_ Luke vi. 21_ 25.,20250223
Many who would not wilfully hurt those who stand in their light_ or have done them a diskindness_ yet are secretly pleased and laugh in their sleeve (as we say) when hurt is done them. But Job was not of that spirit. Though Job was a very good man_ yet_ it seems_ there were those that hated him; but evil found them. He saw their destruction_ and was far from rejoicing in it; for that would justly have brought the destruction upon him_ as it is intimated_ Prov. xxiv. 17_,20250223
Many_ of old_ pretended to know the mind of God by dreams_ and were so full of them that they almost made God's people forget his name by their dreams (Jer. xxiii. 25_ 26); and many now perplex themselves with their frightful or odd dreams_ or with other people's dreams_ as if they foreboded this or the other disaster. Those that heed dreams shall have a multitude of them to fill their heads with; but in them all there are divers vanities_ as there are in many words_ and the more if we regard them. __They are but like the idle impertinent chat of children and fools_ and therefore never heed them; forget them; instead of repeating them lay no stress upon them_ draw no disquieting conclusions from them_ but fear thou God; have an eye to his sovereign dominion_ set him before thee_ keep thyself in his love_ and be afraid of offending him_ and then thou wilt not disturb thyself with foolish dreams.__ The way not to be dismayed at the signs of heaven_ nor afraid of the idols of the heathen_ is to fear God as King of nations_ Jer. x. 2_ 5_ 7.,20250223
Margin. Job's wealth_ with his wisdom_ entitled him to the honour and power he had in his country_ which he describes (ch. xxix.)_ and made him sit chief. Job was upright and honest_ and yet grew rich_ nay_ therefore grew rich; for honesty is the best policy_ and piety and charity are ordinarily the surest ways of thriving. He had a great household and much business_ and yet kept up the fear and worship of God; and he and his house served the Lord. The account of Job's piety and prosperity comes before the history of his great afflictions_ to show that neither will secure us from the common_ no_ nor from the uncommon calamities of human life. Piety will not secure us_ as Job's mistaken friends thought_ for all things come alike to all; prosperity will not_ as a careless world thinks_ Isa. xlvii I sit as a queen and therefore shall see no sorrow.,20250223

Meekness is wisdom. He rightly understands himself_ and his duty and interest_ the infirmities of human nature_ and the constitution of human society_ who is slow to anger_ and knows how to excuse the faults of others as well as his own_ how to adjourn his resentments_ and moderate them_ so as by no provocation to be put out of the possession of his own soul. A mild patient man is really to be accounted an intelligent man_ one that learns of Christ_ who is Wisdom itself,20250223
Meekness is wisdom: A prudent man covers shame. ,20250223
Meekness the great peace-maker: He that is slow to anger not only prevents strife_ that it be not kindled_ but appeases it if it be already kindled_ brings water to the flame_ unites those again that have fallen out_ and by gentle methods brings them to mutual concessions for peace-sake.,20250223
Men groan from out of the city_ and the soul of the wounded cries out against the oppressors_ yet God lays not folly to them_ does not reckon with them for it. This is a thing that Job knows not what to make of_ nor how to reconcile to the justice of God and his government. Is there a righteous God_ and can it be that he should so slowly hear_ so slowly see?,20250223
Men may by unrighteous practices build their houses_ but they cannot establish them_ for the foundation is rotten (Hab. ii. 9_ 10); whereas what is honestly got will wear like steel and be an inheritance to children's children. ,20250223
Men projecting. They keep their designs to themselves_ but they cannot hide them from God; he knows the many devices that are in men's hearts_—devices against his counsels (as those_ Ps. ii. 1-3; Micah iv. 11)_— devices without his counsel (no regard had to his providence_ as those Jam. iv. 13_ this and the other they will do_ and not take God along with them)_—devices unlike God's counsels; men are wavering in their devices_ and often absurd and unjust_ but God's counsels are wise and holy_ steady and uniform,20250223
Men that are pure are proved to be such by their work_ for it is right_ it is just and regular; and they are accepted of God and approved of men. The way of mankind in their apostasy is froward and strange; but as for the pure_ those that by the grace of God are recovered out of that state_ of which there is here and there one_ their work is right_ as Noah's was in the old world_ Gen. vii. 1.,20250223
Men that have any sense of gratitude will return it if there be occasion; the merciful shall find mercy and the kind be kindly dealt with,20250223
Men that take pains in study and serviceableness will thereby gain such an interest and reputation as will give them a dominion over all about them_ by which means many have risen strangely. He that has been faithful in a few things shall be made ruler over many things. The elders_ that labour in the word and doctrine_ are worthy of double honour; and those that are diligent when they are young will get that which will enable them to rule_ and so to rest_ when they are old,20250223
Men think_ when they are engaged in quarrels_ that it would be a shame to them to go back and let fall the weapon; whereas really it is an honour for a man to cease from strife_ an honour to withdraw an action_ to drop a controversy_ to forgive an injury_ and to be friends with those that we have fallen out with. It is the honour of a man_ a wise man_ a man of spirit_ to show the command he has of himself by ceasing from strife_ yielding_ and stooping_ and receding from his just demands_ for peace-sake_ as Abraham_ the better man_ Gen. xiii. 8.,20250223
Men's wickedness_ by which they often evade or outface the justice of the prince_ cannot secure them from the arrest of death_ nor can the most obstinate sinner harden his heart against those terrors. Though he strengthen himself ever so much in his wickedness (Ps. death will be too strong for him. The most subtle wickedness cannot outwit death_ nor the most impudent wickedness outbrave death. Nay_ the wickedness which men give themselves to will be so far from delivering them from death that it will deliver them up to death.,20250223
Men's words will be judged of by the affections with which they speak; he that not only speaks aright (which a bad man may do to save his credit or please his company)_ but loves to speak so_ speaks well of choice_ and with delight_ to him it will be life; and he that not only speaks amiss (which a good man may do through inadvertency)_ but loves to speak so (Ps. lii. to him it will be death. As men love it they shall eat the fruit of it.,20250223
Methinks I can almost forgive Eliphaz his hard censures of Job_ which we had in the beginning of the chapter_ though they were very unjust and unkind_ for this good counsel and encouragement which he gives him in these verses with which he closes his discourse_ and than which nothing could be better said_ nor more to the purpose. Though he thought him a bad man_ yet he saw reason to have hopes concerning him_ that_ for all this_ he would be both pious and prosperous. But it is strange that out of the same mouth_ and almost in the same breath_ both sweet waters and bitter should proceed. Good men_ though they may perhaps be put into a heat_ yet sometimes will talk themselves into a better temper_ and_ it may be_ sooner than another could talk them into it. Eliphaz had laid before Job the miserable condition of a wicked man_ that he might frighten him into repentance. Here_ on the other hand_ he shows him the happiness which those may be sure of that do repent_ that he might allure and encourage him to it. Ministers must try both ways in dealing with people_ must speak to them from Mount Sinai by the terrors of the law_ and from Mount Sion by the comforts of the gospel_ must set before them both life and death_ good and evil_ the blessing and the curse. Now here observe_,20250223
Mildness and tenderness towards those that have been injurious to us_ ver. 19-22. In short_ the best way to save ourselves from the vexation which the vanity of the world creates us is to keep our temper and to maintain a strict government of our passions.,20250223
Mildness_ to speak without passion or provocation: A soft tongue breaks the bone; it mollifies the roughest spirits and overcomes those that are most morose_ like lightning_ which_ they say_ has sometimes broken the bone_ and yet not pierced the flesh. Gideon with a soft tongue pacified the Ephraimites and Abigail turned away David's wrath. Hard words_ we say_ break no bones_ and therefore we should bear them patiently; but_ it seems_ soft words do_ and therefore we should_ on all occasions_ give them prudently.,20250223
Ministers are the church's teeth; like nurses_ they chew the meat for the babes of Christ. The Chaldee paraphrase applies it to the priests and Levites_ who fed upon the sacrifices as the representatives of the people. Faith_ by which we feed upon Christ_ meditation_ by which we ruminate on the word and chew the cud upon what we have heard_ in order to the digesting of it_ are the teeth of the new man. These are here compared to a flock of sheep. Christ called his disciples and ministers a little flock. It is the praise of teeth to be even_ to be white_ and kept clean_ like sheep from the washing_ and to be firm and well fixed in the gums_ and not like sheep that cast their young; for so the word signifies which we translate barren. It is the praise of ministers to be even in mutual love and concord_ to be pure and clean from all moral pollutions_ and to be fruitful_ bringing forth souls to Christ_ and nursing his lambs.,20250223
Ministers are to be helpers of this joy.,20250223

Mischief is here said to attend,20250223
Mischief is meat and drink to them; they feed and feast upon it. They eat the bread of the wickedness (they eat up my people as they eat bread_ Ps. xiv. 4) and drink the wine of violence (v. drink iniquity like water_ Job xv,20250223
Mischief is rest and sleep to them. As much satisfaction as a covetous man has when he has got money_ an ambitious man when he has got preferment_ and a good man when he has done good_ so much have they when they have said or done that which is injurious and ill-natured; and they are extremely uneasy if they cannot get their envy and revenge gratified_ as Haman_ to whom every thing was unpleasant as long as Mordecai was unhanged. It intimates likewise how restless and unwearied they are in their mischievous pursuits; they will rather be deprived of sleep than of the pleasure of being vexatious. ,20250223

Modesty is the badge of wisdom. He that is truly wise hides his treasure_ so as not to boast of it (Matt. xiii. though he does not hide his talent_ so as not to trade with it. His wisdom rests in his heart; he digests what he knows_ and has it ready to him_ but does not unseasonably talk of it and make a noise with it. The heart is the seat of the affections_ and there wisdom must rest in the practical love of it_ and not swim in the head,20250223

Moses was a rare instance of one who_ when 120 years old_ had good eye-sight_ but ordinarily the sight decays in old people as soon as any thing_ and it is a mercy to them that art helps nature with spectacles. We have need to improve our sight well while we have it_ because the light of the eyes may be gone before the light of life. Seventhly_ The doors are shut in the streets. Old people keep within doors_ and care not for going abroad to entertainments. The lips_ the doors of the mouth_ are shut in eating_ because the teeth are gone and the sound of the grinding with them is low_ so that they have not that command of their meat in their mouths which they used to have; they cannot digest their meat_ and therefore little grist is brought to the mill. Eightly_ Old people rise up at the voice of the bird. They have no sound sleep as young people have_ but a little thing disturbs them_ even the chirping of a bird; they cannot rest for coughing_ and therefore rise up at cock-crowing_ as soon as any body is stirring; or they are apt to be jealous_ and timorous_ and full of care_ which breaks their sleep and makes them rise early; or they are apt to be superstitious_ and rise up as in a fright_ at those voices of birds_ as of ravens_ or screech-owls_ which soothsayers call ominous. Ninthly_ With them all the daughters of music are brought low. They have neither voice nor ear_ can neither sing themselves nor take any pleasure_ as Solomon had done in the days of his youth_ in singing men_ and singing women_ and musical instruments_ ch. ii,20250223
Moses was hid in a cleft of the rock_ that he might behold something of God's glory_ which otherwise he could not have borne the brightness of. She retires into the secret places of the stairs_ where she may be alone_ undisturbed_ and may the better commune with her own heart. Good Christians will find time to be private. Christ often withdrew to a mountain himself alone_ to pray. Or_  her blame. She crept into the clefts of the rock_ and the secret places_ for fear and shame_ any where to hide her head_ being heartless and discouraged_ and shunning even the sight of her beloved. Being conscious to herself of her own unfitness and unworthiness to come into his presence_ and speak to him_ she drew back_ and was like a silly dove without heart_ Hos.,20250223
Most interpreters are of opinion that Lemuel is Solomon; the name signifies one that is for God_ or devoted to God; and so it agrees well enough with that honourable name which_ by divine appointment_ was given to Solomon ( 2 Sam. xii.,20250223

Thou that teachest another to faint_ dost thou faint? Rom. ii,20250223
Much more happy were those thought on whom he smiled_ and they thought themselves so_ v,20250223
Much more when they were brought with wicked minds_ when their sacrifices were made_ not only consistent with_ but serviceable to_ their wickedness_ as Absalom's vow_ Jezebel's fast_ and the Pharisees' long prayers. When men make a show of devotion_ that they may the more easily and effectually compass some covetous or malicious design_ when holiness is pretended_ but some wickedness intended_ then especially the performance is an abomination_ Isa. lxvi. 5.,20250223
Multitudes are brought to ruin by bad company: A companion of fools shall be broken (so some)_ shall be known (so the LXX.)_ known to be a fool; noscitur ex socio—he is known by his company.

Secondly_ __I_ and not another for me_ shall see him. Though my flesh and body be consumed_ yet I shall not need a proxy; I shall see him with my own eyes.__ This was what Job hoped for_ and what he earnestly desired_ which_ some think_ is the meaning of the last clause: My reins are spent in my bosom_ that is_ __all my desires are summed up and concluded in this; this will crown and complete them all; let me have this_ and I shall have nothing more to desire; it is enough; it is all.__ With this the prayers of David_ the son of Jesse_ are ended.,20250223

Nay_ it has of old been observed that Fortune favours fools_ and that half-witted men often thrive most_ while the greatest projectors forecast worst for themselves. The same sickness_ the same sword_ devours wise men and fools. Solomon applies this mortifying observation to himself (v. that though he was a wise man_ he might not glory in his wisdom; I said to my heart_ when it began to be proud or secure_ As it happens to the fool_ so it happens to me_ even to me; for thus emphatically it is expressed in the original: __So_ as for me_ it happens to me. Am I rich? So is many a Nabal that fares as sumptuously as I do. Is a foolish man sick_ does he get a fall? So do I_ even I; and neither my wealth nor my wisdom will be my security. And why was I then more wise? Why should I take so much pains to get wisdom_ when_ as to this life_ it will stand me in so little stead? Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity.__ Some make this a correction of what was said before_ like that (Ps. lxx.,20250223
Nay_ let not a poor servant think himself incapable of thriving and being preferred; for if he be diligent in waiting on his master_ observant of him and obedient to him_ if he keep his master (so the word is)_ if he do all he can for the securing of his person and reputation and take care that his estate be not wasted or damaged_ such a one shall be honoured_ shall not only get a good word_ but be preferred and rewarded. God is a Master who has engaged to put an honour on those that serve him faithfully_ John xii. 26.,20250223
Nay_ perhaps it is true_ and thou mayest stand behind the curtain and hear it thyself_ mayest hear thyself not only blamed and despised_ but cursed_ the worst evil said of thee and wished to thee_ and that by a servant_ one of the meanest rank_ of the abjects_ nay_ by thy own servant_ who should be an advocate for thee_ and protect thy good name as well as thy other interests. Perhaps it is a servant thou hast been kind to_ and yet he requites thee thus ill_ and this will vex thee; thou hadst better not have heard it. Perhaps it is a servant thou hast wronged and dealt unjustly with_ and_ though he dares not tell thee so_ he tells others so_ and tells God so_ and then thy own conscience will join with him in the reproach_ which will make it much more uneasy.__ The good names of the greatest lie much at the mercy even of the meanest. And perhaps there is a great deal more evil said of us than we think there is_ and by those from whom we little expected it. But we do not consult our own repose_ no_ nor our credit_ though we pretend to be jealous of it_ if we take notice of every word that is spoken diminishingly of us; it is easier to pass by twenty such affronts than to avenge one.,20250223
Nay_ she follows men to their own houses_ and cries to them at the coming in at the doors_ saying_ Peace be to this house; and_ if the son of peace be there_ it shall certainly abide upon it.

Their own consciences follow them with admonitions wherever they go_ which they cannot be out of the hearing of while they carry their own heads and hearts about with them_ which are a law unto themselves,20250223
Nay_ she takes no care to preserve them: The foot of the traveller may crush them_ and the wild beast break them_ v,20250223
Nay_ they are treated as malefactors (who_ when condemned_ had their faces covered_ as Haman's was: He binds their faces in secret) or as dead men: Lazarus_ in the grave_ had his face bound about. Thus complete will be the victory that God will gain_ at last_ over proud sinners that set themselves in opposition to him. Now by this he proves himself to be God. Does he thus hate proud men? Then he is holy. Will he thus punish them? Then he is the just Judge of the world. Can he thus humble them? Then he is the Lord Almighty. When he had abased proud Pharaoh_ and hidden him in the sand of the Red Sea_ Jethro thence inferred that doubtless the Lord is greater than all gods_ for wherein the proud enemies of his Israel dealt proudly he was above them_ he was too hard for them_ Exod. xviii,20250223
Neglect of poor strangers_ ver. 32,20250223
Neither have they any more a portion for ever_ none of that which they imagined would be a portion for ever_ of that which is done and got under the sun. The things of this world will not be a portion for the soul because they will not be a portion for ever; those that choose them_ and have them for their good things_ have only a portion in this life_ Ps. xvii,20250223
Neither the face of the heavens nor that of the earth is always the same_ but subject to continual vicissitudes_ diurnal and annual. The winter is past_ but has not passed away for ever; it will come again_ and we must provide for it in summer_ Prov. vi. 6_ 8. We must weep in winter_ and rejoice in summer_ as though we wept and rejoiced not_ for both are passing.,20250223
Never did nurse_ when her breasts were gorged_ so long to have them drawn as Elihu did to deliver his mind concerning Job's case_ v. 18-20. If any of the disputants had hit that which he thought was the right joint_ he would contentedly have been silent; but_ when he thought they all missed it_ he was eager to be trying his hand at it. He pleads_ ,20250223
Nihil est unum uni tam simile_ tam par_ quam omnes inter nosmet ipsos sumus. Sui nemo ipse tam similis quam omnes sunt omnium—No one thing is so like another as man is to man. No person is so like himself as each person is to all besides. Cic. de Legib. lib. 1. One corrupt heart is like another_ and so is one sanctified heart_ for the former bears the same image of the earthy_ the latter the same image of the heavenly.,20250223
No creature in this world is comparable to him for strength and terror. Or the earth is here distinguished from the sea: His dominion is not upon the earth (so some)_ but in the waters. None of all the savage creatures upon earth come near him for bulk and strength_ and it is well for man that he is confined to the waters and there has a watch set upon him (ch. vii. 12) by the divine Providence_ for_ if such a terrible creature were allowed to roam and ravage upon this earth_ it would be an unsafe and uncomfortable habitation for the children of men_ for whom it is intended. ,20250223
No expressions of love can be more passionate than these here_ in which Christ manifests his affection to his church; and yet that great proof of his love_ his dying for it_ that he might present it to himself a glorious church_ goes far beyond them all. A spouse so dearly bought and paid for could not but be dearly loved. Such a price being given for her_ a high value must needs be put upon her accordingly; and both together may well set us a wondering at the height and depth_ and length and breadth_ of the love of Christ_ which surpasses knowledge_ that love in which he gave himself for us and gives himself to us. Observe_ ,20250223
No merchants' ships_ no_ not Solomon's navy_ ever made a more advantageous return than her employments do. Do they bring in foreign commodities with the effects they export? So does she with the fruit of her labours. What her own ground does not produce she can furnish herself with_ if she have occasion for it_ by exchanging her own goods for it; and so she brings her food from afar. Not that she values things the more for their being far-fetched_ but_ if they be ever so far off_ if she must have them she knows how to come by them. ,20250223
No order is observed in bringing people to the grave_ not the eldest first_ not the richest_ not the poorest_ and yet every one in his own order_ the order appointed by the God of life. Secondly_ That there is no light there. In the grave there is thick darkness_ darkness that cannot be felt indeed_ yet cannot but be feared by those that enjoy the light of life. In the grave there is no knowledge_ no comfort_ no joy_ no praising God_ no working out our salvation_ and therefore no light. Job was so much ashamed that others should see his sores_ and so much afraid to see them himself_ that the darkness of the grave_ which would hide them and huddle them up_ would upon that account be welcome to him. Darkness comes upon us; and therefore let us walk and work while we have the light with us. The grave being a land of darkness_ it is well we are carried thither with our eyes closed_ and then it is all one. The grave is a land of darkness to man; our friends that have gone thither we reckon removed into darkness_ Ps. lxxxviii,20250223
No pleasure more grateful_ more relishing_ to the luxurious than rest to the laborious; nor can any rich man take so much satisfaction in the return of his rent-days as the hireling in his day's wages. The comparison is plain_ the application is concise and somewhat obscure_ but we must supply a word or two_ and then it is easy: exactness of language is not to be expected from one in Job's condition. __As a servant earnestly desires the shadow_ so and for the same reason I earnestly desire death; for I am made to possess_ &c.__ Hear his complaint.,20250223
No rational words will be got from them. They are dogged and sullen; and_ though they understand the questions you ask them_ they will not give you an answer; though you make it ever so plain to them what you expect from them_ they will not promise you to mend what is amiss nor to mind their business. See the folly of those servants whose mouth by their silence calls for strokes; they might be corrected by words and save blows_ but they will not.,20250223
Noli me tangere—Touch me not. ,20250223
Non est mortale quod opto_ immortale peto—I seek not for that which perishes_ but for that which abides for ever. __But_ as for the hopes you would buoy me up with_ they shall go down with me to the bars of the pit. You are dying men_ and cannot make good your promises. I am a dying man_ and cannot enjoy the good you promise. Since_ therefore_ our rest will be together in the dust_ let us all lay aside the thoughts of this world and set our hearts upon another.__ We must shortly be in the dust_ for dust we are_ dust and ashes in the pit_ under the bars of the pit_ held fast there_ never to loose the bands of death till the general resurrection. But we shall rest there; we shall rest together there. Job and his friends could not agree now_ but they will both be quiet in the grave; the dust of that will shortly stop their mouths and put an end to the controversy. Let the foresight of this cool the heat of all contenders and moderate the disputers of this world.,20250223
None can possibly give a valuable consideration for it_ with all the wealth this world can furnish them with. This Job enlarges upon,20250223
None will take the liberty to reprove him_ to tell him of the wickedness of his way_ and what will be in the end thereof; so that he sins securely_ and is not made to know either shame or fear. The prosperity of fools destroys them_ by setting them (in their own conceit) above reproofs_ by which they might be brought to that repentance which alone will prevent their ruin. Those are marked for destruction that are let alone in sin_ Hos.,20250223
Nor can any relieve the distresses of the mind against God and his terrors. If he impress the sense of his wrath upon a guilty conscience_ all the comforts the creature can administer are ineffectual. As vinegar upon nitre_ so are songs to a heavy heart. The irresistibleness of God's operations must be acknowledged in his dealings both with communities and with particular persons: what he does cannot be controlled_ whether it be done against a nation in its public capacity or against a man only in his private affairs. The same Providence that governs mighty kingdoms presides in the concerns of the meanest individual; and neither the strength of a whole nation can resist his power nor the smallness of a single person evade his cognizance; but what he does shall be done effectually and victoriously.,20250223
Nor do they only draw contempt upon themselves_ but they bring ignominy and reproach upon their families_ their friends_ their ministers_ and all that are in any way related to them. Those therefore who would secure their honour must retain their virtue.,20250223
Nor feel their leaping life's returning tide.,20250223
Nor is there any law more just than that the contrivers of destruction should perish by their own arts.,20250223
Nor their names from being buried in oblivion; for they were forgotten_ as if they had never been.,20250223
Not as if Job thought that God did thus torment him that he might find occasion against him; but his dealings with him had such an aspect_ which was dishonourable to God_ and would tempt men to think him a hard master. __Now_ Lord_ if thou wilt not consult my comfort_ consult thy own honour; do something for thy great name_ and do not disgrace the throne of thy glory___ Jer. xiv. 21.,20250223
Not by afflictions broken_ but refined.,20250223
Not by force of arguments. __I dare not try the merits of the cause. If I speak of judgment_ and insist upon my right_ who will set me a time to plead? There is no higher power to which I may appeal_ no superior court to appoint a hearing of the cause; for he is supreme and from him proceeds every man's judgment_ which he must abide by.__,20250223
Not by force of arms. __I dare not enter the lists with the Almighty; for if I speak of strength_ and think to come off by that_ lo_ he is strong_ stronger than I_ and will certainly overpower me.__ There is no disputing (said one once to Cæsar) with him that commands legions. Much less is there any with him that has legions of angels at command. Can thy heart endure (thy courage and presence of mind) or can thy hands be strong to defend thyself_ in the days that I shall deal with thee? Ezek. xxii,20250223
Not only from the persons that sat in judgment_ but even in the places where judgment was_ in pretence_ administered_ and righteousness was expected_ there was iniquity; men met with the greatest wrongs in those courts to which they fled for justice. This is vanity and vexation; for_ ,20250223
Not that we must therefore pretend modesty and humility_ and make a stratagem of it_ for the courting of honour_ but therefore we must really be modest and humble_ because God will put honour on such and so will men too. It is better_ more for a man's satisfaction and reputation_ to be advanced above his pretensions and expectations_ than to be thrust down below them_ in the presence of the prince_ whom it was a great piece of honour to be admitted to the sight of and a great piece of presumption to look upon without leave.,20250223
Not to admire bodily bulk_ or beauty_ or strength_ nor to value persons or think the better of them for such advantages_ but to judge of men by their wisdom and conduct_ their industry and application to business_ which are characters that deserve respect,20250223
Not to be over-critical in his resentments. Whereas it is commonly looked upon as a piece of ingenuity to apprehend an affront quickly_ it is here made a man's glory to pass over a transgression_ to appear as if he did not see it (Ps. xxxviii. or_ if he sees fit to take notice of it_ yet to forgive it and meditate no revenge.,20250223
Not to be so foolish as to suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by the pretensions of friendship. Remember to distrust when a man speaks fair; be not too forward to believe him unless you know him well_ for it is possible there may be seven abominations in his heart_ a great many projects of mischief against you_ which he is labouring so industriously to conceal with his fair speech. Satan is an enemy that hates us_ and yet in his temptations speaks fair_ as he did to Eve_ but it is madness to give credit to him_ for there are seven abominations in his heart; seven other spirits does one unclean spirit bring more wicked than himself,20250223
Not to be so wicked as to impose upon any with a profession of friendship; for_ though the fraud may be carried on plausibly awhile_ it will be brought to light_ v,20250223
Not to despise the weak things of the world; there are those that are little upon the earth_ poor in the world and of small account_ and yet are exceedingly wise_ wise for their souls and another world_ and those are exceedingly wise_ wiser than their neighbours. Margin_ They are wise_ made wise by the special instinct of nature. All that are wise to salvation are made wise by the grace of God.,20250223
Not to indulge ourselves in a fond conceit that we can mend that which has been well done before us. Let us esteem others better than ourselves_ and think how unfit we are to attempt the improvement of the performances of better heads and hands than ours_ and rather own how much we are beholden to them_ John iv. 37_ 38,20250223
Not to speak ill of our rulers_ no_ not in secret_ ver. 20.,20250223
Note,20250223
Note 1. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous: In the way of the froward_ that crooked way_ which is contrary to the will and word of God_ thorns and snares are found_ thorns of grief for past sins and snares entangling them in further sin. He that makes no conscience of what he says and does will find himself hampered by that imaginary liberty_ and tormented by his pleasures. Froward people_ who are soon angry_ expose themselves to trouble at every step. Every thing will fret and vex him that will fret and vex at every thing,20250223
Note_,20250223
Note_ ,20250223
Note_ All things considered_ we have no reason to reckon upon the long continuance of life in this world. What is our strength? It is depending strength. We have no more strength than God gives us; for in him we live and move. It is decaying strength; we are daily spending the stock_ and by degrees it will be exhausted. It is disproportionable to the encounters we may meet with; what is our strength to be depended upon_ when two or three days' sickness will make us weak as water? Instead of expecting a long life_ we have reason to wonder that we have lived hitherto and to feel that we are hastening off apace,20250223
Note_ God can soon nonplus the deepest politicians and bring the greatest wits to their wits' end_ to show that wherein they deal proudly he is above them.,20250223
Note_ God is unsearchable. The ages of his eternity cannot be numbered_ nor the spaces of his immensity measured; the depths of his wisdom cannot be fathomed_ nor the reaches of his power bounded; the brightness of his glory can never be described_ nor the treasures of his goodness reckoned up. This is a good reason why we should always speak of God with humility and caution and never prescribe to him nor quarrel with him_ why we should be thankful for what he has revealed of himself and long to be where we shall see him as he is_ 1 Cor. xiii. 9_ 10. ,20250223
Note_ It is a great comfort to those who mean honestly that God understands their meaning_ though men do not_ cannot_ or will not. ,20250223
Note_ It is no new thing for the people of God to fall under the anger of their own mother's children. It was thou_ a man_ my equal_ Ps. lv. 12_ 13. This makes the trouble the more irksome and grievous; from such it is taken unkindly_ and the anger of such is implacable. A brother offended is hard to be won. ,20250223
Note_ It is wisdom not to use ourselves or our children to be nice and dainty about meat and drink_ because we know not how we or they may be reduced_ nor how that which we now disdain may be made acceptable by necessity,20250223
Note_ Kings are not exempt from God's jurisdiction. To us they are gods_ but men to him_ and subject to more than the common changes of human life. ,20250223
Note_ Man_ at the best_ wears fast; but_ under God's rebukes especially_ he is soon gone. While there is so little soundness in the soul_ no marvel there is so little soundness in the flesh_ Ps. xxxviii. 3.,20250223
Note_ Rich and poor stand upon the same level before God. A great man shall fare never the better_ nor find any favour_ for his wealth and greatness; nor shall a poor man fare ever the worse for his poverty_ nor an honest cause be starved. Job_ now that he was poor_ should have as much favour with God_ and be as much regarded by him_ as when he was rich; for they are all the work of his hands. Their persons are so: the poor are made by the same hand_ and of the same mould_ as the rich. Their conditions are so: the poor were made poor by the divine providence_ as well as the rich made rich; and therefore the poor shall fare never the worse for that which is their lot_ not their fault.,20250223
Note_ The Holy Ghost sometimes denies his favours and discovers his terrors to the best and dearest of his saints and servants in this world. This case occurs_ not only in the production_ but sometimes in the progress of the divine life. Evidences for heaven are eclipsed_ sensible communications interrupted_ dread of divine wrath impressed_ and the returns of comfort_ for the present_ despaired of_ Ps. lxxvii. 7-9; lxxxviii. 7_ 15_ 16. These are grievous burdens to a gracious soul_ that values God's loving-kindness as better than life_ Prov. xviii,20250223
Note_ Though we may by surprise be drawn into an evil thing_ yet we must not stand in it_ but recede from it as soon as it appears to us to be evil. ,20250223
Nothing is done to his sore but what he does himself_ with his own hands. His children and servants are all dead_ his wife unkind_ ch. xix,20250223
Nothing is more grateful than to enjoy that_ at last_ which we have long wished and waited for: When the desire does come it puts men into a sort of paradise_ a garden of pleasure_ for it is a tree of life. It will aggravate the eternal misery of the wicked that their hopes will be frustrated; and it will make the happiness of heaven the more welcome to the saints that it is what they have earnestly longed for as the crown of their hopes.,20250223
Nothing is more grievous than the disappointment of a raised expectation_ though not in the thing itself by a denial_ yet in the time of it by a delay: Hope deferred makes the heart sick and languishing_ fretful and peevish; but hope quite dashed kills the heart_ and the more high the expectation was raised the more cutting is the frustration of it. It is therefore our wisdom not to promise ourselves any great matters from the creature_ not to feed ourselves with any vain hopes from this world_ lest we lay up matter for our own vexation; and what we do hope for let us prepare to be disappointed in_ that_ if it should prove so_ it may prove the easier; and let us not be hasty,20250223
Nothing is more offensive to God than deceit in commerce. A false balance is here put for all manner of unjust and fraudulent practices in dealing with any person_ which are all an abomination to the Lord_ and render those abominable to him that allow themselves in the use of such accursed arts of thriving. It is an affront to justice_ which God is the patron of_ as well as a wrong to our neighbour_ whom God is the protector of. Men make light of such frauds_ and think there is no sin in that which there is money to be got by_ and_ while it passes undiscovered_ they cannot blame themselves for it; a blot is no blot till it is hit_ Hos. xii. 7_ 8. But they are not the less an abomination to God_ who will be the avenger of those that are defrauded by their brethren,20250223
Nothing is more pleasing to God than fair and honest dealing_ nor more necessary to make us and our devotions acceptable to him: A just weight is his delight. He himself goes by a just weight_ and holds the scale of judgment with an even hand_ and therefore is pleased with those that are herein followers of him. A balance cheats_ under pretence of doing right most exactly_ and therefore is the greater abomination to God.,20250223
Nothing is or can be concealed from him (v. 22): There is no darkness nor shadow of death so close_ so thick_ so solitary_ so remote from light or sight as that in it the workers of iniquity may hide themselves from the discovering eye and avenging hand of the righteous God. Observe here_ ,20250223
Nothing more constant than the rising sun_ it never misses its appointed time; yet God_ when he pleases_ can suspend it. He that at first commanded it to rise can countermand it. Once the sun was told to stand_ and another time to retreat_ to show that it is still under the check of its great Creator. Thus great is God's power; and how great then is his goodness_ which causes his sun to shine even upon the evil and unthankful_ though he could withhold it! He that made the stars also_ can_ if he pleases_ seal them up_ and hide them from our eyes. By earthquakes and subterraneous fires mountains have sometimes been removed and the earth shaken: in very dark and cloudy days and nights it seems to us as if the sun were forbidden to rise and the stars were sealed up_ Acts xxvii,20250223
Nothing more firm than the mountains. When we speak of removing mountains we mean that which is impossible; yet the divine power can make them change their seat: He removes them and they know not_ removes them whether they will or no; he can make them lower their heads; he can level them_ and overturn them in his anger; he can spread the mountains as easily as the husbandman spreads the molehills_ be they ever so high_ and large_ and rocky. Men have much ado to pass over them_ but God_ when he pleases_ can make them pass away. He made Sinai shake_ Ps. lxviii,20250223
Nothing more fixed than the earth on its axletree; yet God can_ when he pleases_ shake the earth out of its place_ heave it off its centre_ and make even its pillars to tremble; what seemed to support it will itself need support when God gives it a shock. See how much we are indebted to God's patience. God has power enough to shake the earth from under that guilty race of mankind which makes it groan under the burden of sin_ and so to shake the wicked out of it (Job,20250223
Nothing of the dark recesses of the sea and earth_ ver. 16-21,20250223
Nothing of the limiting of the sea_ ver. 8-11,20250223
Nothing of the morning light_ ver. 12-15,20250223
Nothing of the springs in the clouds (ver. 22-27)_ nor the secret counsels by which they are directed,20250223
Nothing sensible is to us more unaccountable than the wind. We hear the sound of it_ yet cannot tell whence it comes_ nor whither it goes; but God gives it out by weight_ wisely ordering both from what point it shall blow and with what strength. The waters of the sea_ and the rain-waters_ he both weighs and measures_ allotting the proportion of every tide and every shower. A great and constant communication there is between clouds and seas_ the waters above the firmament and those under it. Vapours go up_ rains come down_ air is condensed into water_ water rarefied into air; but the great God keeps an exact account of all the stock with which this trade is carried on for the public benefit and sees that none of it be lost. Now if_ in these things_ Providence be so exact_ much more in dispensing frowns and favours_ rewards and punishments_ to the children of men_ according to the rules of equity.,20250223
Nothing will last always_ for we see even mountains moulder and come to nought; they wither and fall as a leaf; rocks wax old and pass away by the continual beating of the sea against them. The waters wear the stones with constant dropping_ non vi_ sed sæpe cadendo—not by the violence_ but by the constancy with which they fall. On this earth every thing is the worse for the wearing. Tempus edax rerum—Time devours all things. It is not so with the heavenly bodies. ,20250223
Notice is sometimes given of the approach of rain_ v,20250223
Notwithstanding his gravity and grace_ he had found time to be cheerful; but now his tune was altered. Let those therefore that rejoice be as though they rejoiced not_ for they know not how soon their laughter will be turned into mourning and their joy into heaviness. Thus we see how much Job complains of; but_,20250223
Notwithstanding the distance that is in many respects between rich and poor_ yet in most things they meet together_ especially before the Lord_ who is the Maker of them all_ and regards not the rich more than the poor_ Job xxxiv,20250223
Notwithstanding the long continuance of life_ and the many comforts of it_ yet we must remember the days of darkness_ because those will certainly come_ and they will come with much the less terror if we have thought of them before.,20250223
Now God is ready to hear their prayers and to meet them with mercy_ if they would but seek to him for it; but then the door will be shut_ and they shall cry in vain (v. 28): __Then shall they call upon me when it is too late_ Lord_ Lord_ open to us. They would then gladly be beholden to that mercy which now they reject and make light of; but I will not answer_ because_ when I called_ they would not answer;__ all the answer then will be_ Depart from me_ I know you not. This has been the case of some even in this life_ as of Saul_ whom God answered not by Urim or prophets; but_ ordinarily_ while there is life there is room for prayer and hope of speeding_ and therefore this must refer to the inexorable justice of the last judgment. Then those that slighted God will seek him early (that is_ earnestly)_ but in vain; they shall not find him_ because they sought him not when he might be found_ Isa. lv,20250223
Now God pities their folly_ but he will then laugh at their calamity (v. 26): __I also will laugh at your distress_ even as you laughed at my counsel.__ Those that ridicule religion will thereby but make themselves ridiculous before all the world. The righteous will laugh at them (Ps. lii. for God himself will. It intimates that they shall be for ever shut out of God's compassions; they have so long sinned against mercy that they have now quite sinned it away. His eye shall not spare_ neither will he have pity. Nay_ his justice being glorified in their ruin_ he will be pleased with it_ though now he would rather they should turn and live. Ah! I will ease me of my adversaries. ,20250223
Now he is brought to the prayer Elihu taught him_ That which I see not teach thou me.,20250223
Now here_,20250223
Now it is of great consequence to us whether that be satisfied_ and what that is filled with_ for_ accordingly_ will our satisfaction be and our inward peace,20250223
Now sinners are in prosperity and secure; they live at ease_ and set sorrow at defiance. But_ First_ Their calamity will come (v. 26); sickness will come_ and those diseases which they shall apprehend to be the very arrests and harbingers of death; other troubles will come_ in mind_ in estate_ which will convince them of their folly in setting,20250223
Now the matter of that is not found in the secrets of nature or providence_ but in the rules for our own practice. Unto man he said_ not_ __Go up to heaven_ to fetch happiness thence;__ or_ __Go down to the deep_ to draw it up thence.__ No_ the word is nigh thee_ Deut. xxx,20250223
Now there are two things which Eliphaz here maintains_ and in which he doubts not but all the saints concur with him:—,20250223
Now they are eager upon their own way_ and fond of their own devices; but then they will have enough of them (v. according to the proverb_ Let men drink as they brew; they shall eat the fruit of their own way; their wages shall be according to their work_ and_ as was their choice_ so shall their doom be_ Gal. vi. 7_ 8. Note_ First_ There is a natural tendency in sin to destruction_ Jam. i,20250223
Now they value themselves upon their worldly prosperity; but then that shall help to aggravate their ruin_ v,20250223
Now this description of the returning spring_ as a reason for coming away with Christ_ is applicable ,20250223
Now we must suppose Christ graciously returned to his spouse_ from whom he had withdrawn himself_ returned to converse with her (for he speaks to her and makes her to hear joy and gladness)_ returned to favour her_ having forgiven and forgotten all her unkindness_ for he speaks very tenderly and respectfully to her.,20250223
Now_,20250223
Now_ ,20250223
Now_ in this mother's (this queen mother's) catechism_ observe_,20250223
Now_ though Solomon specifies only the temptation to rob on the highway_ yet he intends hereby to warn us against all other evils which sinners entice men to. Such are the ways of the drunkards and unclean; they are indulging themselves in those pleasures which tend to their ruin both here and for ever; and therefore consent not to them.,20250223
Now_ to take off this offence_,20250223
Numerous_ and such as can never be reckoned up. He doeth great things without number; his power is never exhausted_ nor will all his purposes ever be fulfilled till the end of time. ,20250223
O that one might plead for a man with God! and (ch. xxii.,20250223
O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. 6 Hear now my reasoning_ and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 7 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? 8 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? 9 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another_ do ye so mock him? 10 He will surely reprove you_ if ye do secretly accept persons. 11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? 12 Your remembrances are like unto ashes_ your bodies to bodies of clay.,20250223
O the precious hours which thousands throw away thus_ every one of which will be brought into the account at the great day! ,20250223
O ye simple_ understand wisdom: and_ ye fools_ be ye of an understanding heart. 6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. 7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.,20250223

It is so when it is concealed by flattery and dissimulation: He is a fool_ though he may think himself a politician_ that hides hatred with lying lips_ lest_ if it break out_ he should be ashamed before men and should lose the opportunity of gratifying his malice. Lying lips are bad enough of themselves_ but have a peculiar malignity in them when they are made a cloak of maliciousness. But he is a fool who thinks to hide any thing from God,20250223
Observe how finely he describes the repose of the grave_ which (provided the soul also be at rest in God) may much assist our triumphs over it. ,20250223
Observe the difference between the petition and the promise: __Draw me_ and then we will run.__ When Christ pours out his Spirit upon the church in general_ which is his bride_ all the members of it do thence receive enlivening quickening influences_ and are made to run to him with the more cheerfulness_,20250223

Observe_ The high places are his high places; for the heaven_ even the heavens_ are the Lord's (Ps. cxv. 16) in a peculiar manner. Peace is God's work; where it is made it is he that makes it_ Isa. lvii,20250223
Observe_ When he would show what great things God does he speaks of his giving rain_ which_ because it is a common thing_ we are apt to look upon as a little thing_ but_ if we duly consider both how it is produced and what is produced by it_ we shall see it to be a great work both of power and goodness.,20250223
Occasional succour in an exigency. It is good for two to travel together_ for if one happen to fall_ he may be lost for want of a little help. If a man fall into sin_ his friend will help to restore him with the spirit of meekness; if he fall into trouble_ his friend will help to comfort him and assuage his grief. ,20250223
Of God's curse. The bread is eaten in secret_ for fear of discovery and punishment_ and the sinner takes a pride in having so far baffled his convictions_ and triumphed over them_ that_ notwithstanding that fear_ he dares commit the sin_ and can make himself believe that_ being eaten in secret_ it shall never be discovered or reckoned for. Sweetness and pleasantness constitute the bait; but_ by the tempter's own showing_ even that is so absurd_ and has such allays_ that it is a wonder how it can have any influence upon men that pretend to reason.,20250223
Of God's law_ in that the waters are the sweeter for being stolen and come at by breaking through the hedge of the divine command. Nitimur in vetitum—We are prone to what is forbidden. This spirit of contradiction we have from our first parents_ who thought the forbidden tree of all others a tree to be desired,20250223
Of God's unerring wisdom and his inviolable justice_ ver. 6,20250223
Of a weak man: Wisdom is too high for him; he thinks it so_ and therefore_ despairing to attain it_ he will take no pains in the pursuit of it_ but sit down content without it. And really it is so; he has not capacity for it_ and therefore the advantages he has for getting it are all in vain to him. It is no easy thing to get wisdom; those that have natural parts good enough_ yet if they be foolish_ that is_ if they be slothful and will not take pains_ if they be playful and trifling_ and given to their pleasures_ if they be viciously inclined and keep bad company_ it is too high for them; they are not likely to reach it. And_ for want of it_ they are unfit for the service of their country: They open not their mouth in the gate; they are not admitted into the council or magistracy_ or_ if they are_ they are dumb statues_ and stand for cyphers; they say nothing_ because they have nothing to say_ and they know that if they should offer any thing it would not be heeded_ nay_ it would be hissed at. Let young men take pains to get wisdom_ that they may be qualified for public business_ and do it with reputation,20250223
Of a wicked heart showing itself in burning lips_ furious_ passionate_ outrageous words_ burning in malice_ and persecuting those to whom_ or of whom_ they are spoken; ill words and ill-will agree as well together as a potsherd and the dross of silver_ which_ now that the pot is broken and the dross separated from the silver_ are fit to be thrown together to the dunghill,20250223
Of a wicked man_ who is not only despised as a fool is_ but detested. Two sorts of wicked men are so:—,20250223
Of a wise man that his heart is in the house of mourning; he is much conversant with mournful subjects_ and this is both an evidence and a furtherance of his wisdom. The house of mourning is the wise man's school_ where he has learned many a good lesson_ and there_ where he is serious_ he is in his element. When he is in the house of mourning his heart is there to improve the spectacles of mortality that are presented to him; nay_ when he is in the house of feasting_ his heart is in the house of mourning_ by way of sympathy with those that are in sorrow. ,20250223
Of all things that are to be known this is most evident_ that God is to be feared_ to be reverenced_ served_ and worshipped; this is so the beginning of knowledge that those know nothing who do not know this. ,20250223
Of buying many books_ making ourselves master of them_ and masters of what is in them_ by much study; still the desire of learning would be unsatisfied. It will give a man indeed the best entertainment and the best accomplishment this world can afford him; but if we be not by these admonished of the vanity of the world_ and human learning_ among other things_ and its insufficiency to make us happy without true piety_ alas! there is no end of it_ nor real benefit by it; it will weary the body_ but never give the soul any true satisfaction. The great Mr. Selden subscribed to this when he owned that in all the books he had read he never found that on which he could rest his soul_ but in the holy scripture_ especially Tit. ii. 11_ 12. By these therefore let us be admonished.,20250223
Of drinking long_ tarrying long at the wine_ and spending that time in drunken company which should be spent in useful business_ or in sleep_ which should fit for business_ v,20250223
Of drinking that which is strong and intoxicating. They go up and down to seek wine that will please them; their great enquiry is_ __Where is the best liquor?__ They seek mixed wine_ which is most palatable_ but most heady_ so willingly do they sacrifice their reason to please their palate!,20250223
Of his domestics and family relations. Sometimes indeed we find that_ beyond our expectation_ there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother; but the master of a family ordinarily expects to be attended on and taken care of by those of his family_ even when_ through weakness of body or mind_ he has become despicable to others. But poor Job was misused by his own family_ and some of his worst foes were those of his own house. He mentions not his children; they were all dead_ and we may suppose that the unkindness of his surviving relations made him lament the death of his children so much the more: __If they had been alive___ would he think_ __I should have had comfort in them.__ As for those that were now about him_ ,20250223
Of his exemplary patience and piety under these troubles_ ver. 20-22. In all this he is set forth for an example of suffering affliction_ from which no prosperity can secure us_ but through which integrity and uprightness will preserve us.,20250223
Of his great piety in general (ver. 1)_ and in a particular instance_ ver. 5.,20250223
Of his great prosperity_ ver. 2-4.,20250223
Of his incontestable sovereignty and uncontrollable power_ ver. 10,20250223
Of his kindred and acquaintance_ his neighbours_ and such as he had formerly been familiar with_ who were bound by all the laws of friendship and civility to concern themselves for him_ to visit him_ to enquire after him_ and to be ready to do him all the good offices that lay in their power; yet these were estranged from him_ v,20250223
Of his unsearchable perfections_ ver. 7-9,20250223
Of knowing one another by ourselves; for_ as there is a similitude between the face of a man and the reflection of it in the water_ so there is between one man's heart and another's for God has fashioned men's hearts alike; and in many cases we may judge of others by ourselves_ which is one of the foundations on which that rule is built of doing to others as we would be done by_ Exod. xxiii,20250223
Of knowing ourselves. As the water is a looking-glass in which we may see our faces by reflection_ so there are mirrors by which the heart of a man is discovered to a man_ that is_ to himself. Let a man examine his own conscience_ his thoughts_ affections_ and intentions. Let him behold his natural face in the glass of the divine law (Jam. i.,20250223
Of love_ does she say? Of lust she means_ brutish lust; but it is a pity that the name of love should be thus abused. True love is from heaven; this is from hell. How can those pretend to solace themselves and love one another who are really ruining themselves and one another?,20250223
Of man's death_ that it puts a final period to our present life_ to which we shall not again return (ver. 7-12)_ that it hides us from the calamities of life (ver. destroys the hopes of life (ver. 18_ sends us away from the business of life (ver. and keeps us in the dark concerning our relations in this life_ how much soever we have formerly been in care about them ver. 21_ 22.,20250223
Of man's life_ that it is,20250223
Of our own graces; for many a good lesson is to be learned from the troubles of others; we may look upon them and receive instruction_ and be made wise and serious. ,20250223
Of rooted malice_ which is as much worse than the former as coals of juniper are worse than a fire of thorns. Wrath (it is true) is cruel_ and does many a barbarous thing_ and anger is outrageous; but a secret enmity at the person of another_ an envy at his prosperity_ and a desire of revenge for some injury or affront_ are much more mischievous. One may avoid a sudden heat_ as David escaped Saul's javelin_ but when it grows_ as Saul's did_ to a settled envy_ there is no standing before it; it will pursue; it will overtake. He that grieves at the good of another will be still contriving to do him hurt_ and will keep his anger for ever.,20250223
Of sable shades_ and spreads his clouds between.,20250223
Of sincerity: He that is of a faithful spirit_ that is true_ not only to his own promise_ but to the interest of his friend_ conceals every matter which_ if divulged_ may turn to the prejudice of his neighbour.,20250223
Of the change of the resurrection_ when the vile body shall be changed (Phil. iii. and a great and glorious change it will be; and then that question_ If a man die_ shall he live again? must be taken by way of admiration. __Strange! Shall these dry bones live! If so_ all the time appointed for the continuance of the separation between soul and body my separate soul shall wait until that change comes_ when it shall be united again to the body_ and my flesh also shall rest in hope.__ Ps. xvi,20250223
Of the cognizance he takes of the children of men_ ver. 11_ 12.,20250223
Of the folly of sin; as there is a wickedness in folly_ so there is a folly in wickedness_ even foolishness and madness. Wilful sinners are fools and madmen; they act contrary both to right reason and to their true interest.,20250223
Of the gates of death: Have these been open to thee? v,20250223
Of the infinite delight which the persons of the blessed Trinity have in each other_ wherein consists much of the happiness of the divine nature. Or_ 2. Of the pleasure which the Father took in the operations of the Son_ when he made the world; God saw every thing that the Son made_ and_ behold_ it was very good_ it pleased him_ and therefore his Son was daily_ day by day_ during the six days of the creation_ upon that account_ his delight_ Exod. xxxix,20250223
Of the kindred of Abram; so the Chaldee-paraphrase_ supposing him to be first called Ram—high_ then Abram—a high father_ and lastly Abraham—the high father of a multitude. Elihu was not so well known as the rest_ and therefore is more particularly described thus.,20250223
Of the majesty of God_ as a God above him. He thought of his highness_ the infinite distance between him and God_ which possessed him with such a reverence of him as made him very circumspect in his whole conversation. Those who oppress the poor_ and pervert judgment and justice_ forget that he who is higher than the highest regards_ and there is a higher than they_ who is able to deal with them (Eccl. v. 8); but Job considered this,20250223
Of the malice of Satan against him_ and the permission he obtained to try his constancy_ ver. 6-12.,20250223
Of the natural products of it. The things which grow out of the earth_ and seem to be firmly rooted in it_ are sometimes by an excess of rain washed away_ v,20250223
Of the nature of human life: it is a flower_ it is a shadow_ v,20250223
Of the person tempting_ not a common prostitute_ for she was a married wife (v. and_ for aught that appears_ lived in reputation among her neighbours_ not suspected of any such wickedness_ and yet_ in the twilight of the evening_ when her husband was abroad_ abominably impudent. She is here described,20250223
Of the shortness and uncertainty of human life: Man is of few days. Life is here computed_ not by months or years_ but by days_ for we cannot be sure of any day but that it may be our last. These days are few_ fewer than we think of_ few at the most_ in comparison with the days of the first patriarchs_ much more in comparison with the days of eternity_ but much fewer to most_ who come short of what we call the age of man. Man sometimes no sooner comes forth than he is cut down—comes forth out of the womb than he dies in the cradle—comes forth into the world and enters into the business of it than he is hurried away as soon as he has laid his hand to the plough.,20250223
Of the sinfulness of sin; that is it which he lays the greatest stress upon in this inquiry_ to know the wickedness of folly_ by which perhaps he means his own iniquity_ the sin of uncleanness_ for that was commonly called folly in Israel_ Gen. xxxiv. 7; Deut. xxii. 21; Judg. xx. 6,20250223
Of the springs of the sea (v. 16): __Hast thou entered into them_ or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? Knowest thou what lies in the bottom of the sea_ the treasures there hidden in the sands? Or canst thou give an account of the rise and original of the waters of the sea? Vapours are continually exhaled out of the sea. Dost thou know how the recruits are raised by which it is continually supplied? Rivers are constantly poured into the sea. Dost thou know how they are continually discharged_ so as not to overflow the earth? Art thou acquainted with the secret subterraneous passages by which the waters circulate?__ God's way in the government of the world is said to be in the sea_ and in the great waters (Ps. lxxvii. intimating that it is hidden from us and not to be pried into by us.,20250223
Of the strongest parts of it_ v,20250223
Of the surprising troubles that befel him_ the ruin of his estate (ver. 13-17)_ and the death of his children_ ver. 18_ 19.,20250223
Of the temptation itself and the management of it. She met the young spark. Perhaps she knew him; however she knew by his fashions that he was such a one as she wished for; so she caught him about the neck and kissed him_ contrary to all the rules of modesty (v. and waited not for his compliments or courtship_ but with an impudent face invited him not only to her house_ but to her bed.,20250223
Of the wrath of God_ as a God that would certainly be against him if he should wrong the poor. Destruction from God_ because it would be a certain and an utter ruin to him if he were guilty of this sin_ was a constant terror to him_ to restrain him from it. Note_ Good men_ even the best_ have need to restrain themselves from sin with the fear of destruction from God_ and all little enough. This should especially restrain us from all acts of injustice and oppression that God himself is the avenger thereof. Even when salvation from God is a comfort to us_ yet destruction from God should be a terror to us. Adam_ in innocency_ was awed with a threatening.,20250223
Of their comforts. By putting a respect upon them we encourage them_ and some good word may be spoken to them which may help to make them easy. Job's friends came_ not to satisfy their curiosity with an account of his troubles and the strangeness of the circumstances of them_ much less_ as David's false friends_ to make invidious remarks upon him (Ps. xli. 6-8)_ but to mourn with him_ to mingle their tears with his_ and so to comfort him. It is much more pleasant to visit those in affliction to whom comfort belongs than those to whom we must first speak conviction.,20250223
Of their families: The perfect_ in their posterity_ shall remain in it. They shall dwell and remain for ever in the heavenly Canaan_ of which the earthly one was but a type. ,20250223
Of ungoverned passion. The wrath of a fool_ who when he is provoked cares not what he says and does_ is more grievous than a great stone or a load of sand. It lies heavily upon himself. Those who have no command of their passions do themselves even sink under the load of them. The wrath of a fool lies heavily upon those he is enraged at_ to whom_ in his fury_ he will be in danger of doing some mischief. It is therefore our wisdom not to give provocation to a fool_ but_ if he be in a passion_ to get out of his way,20250223
Of what great force gifts (that is_ bribes) are he had intimated before_ ch. xvii. 8_ 23. Here he shows the power of gifts_ that is_ presents made even by inferiors to those that are above them and have much more than they have. A good present will go far,20250223
Of what he feared. He saw himself charged by the terrors of God_ as by an army set in battle-array_ and surrounded by them. God_ by his terrors_ fought against him. As he had no comfort when he retired inward into his own bosom_ so he had none when he looked upward towards Heaven. He that used to be encouraged with the consolations of God not only wanted those_ but was amazed with the terrors of God.,20250223
Of what he felt The arrows of the Almighty are within me. It was not so much the troubles themselves he was under that put him into this confusion_ his poverty_ disgrace_ and bodily pain; but that which cut him to the heart and put him into this agitation_ was to think that the God he loved and served had brought all this upon him and laid him under these marks of his displeasure. Note_ Trouble of mind is the sorest trouble. A wounded spirit who can bear! Whatever burden of affliction_ in body or estate_ God is pleased to lay upon us_ we may well afford to submit to it as long as he continues to the use of our reason and the peace of our consciences; but_ if in either of these we be disturbed_ our case is sad indeed and very pitiable. The way to prevent God's fiery darts of trouble is with the shield of faith to quench Satan's fiery darts of temptation. Observe_ He calls them the arrows of the Almighty; for it is an instance of the power of God above that of any man that he can with his arrows reach the soul. He that made the soul can make his sword to approach to it. The poison or heat of these arrows is said to drink up his spirit_ because it disturbed his reason_ shook his resolution_ exhausted his vigour_ and threatened his life; and therefore his passionate expressions_ though they could not be justified_ might be excused,20250223
Of what ill consequence it is to be precipitate and rash_ and to act without advice: Men's purposes are disappointed_ their measures broken_ and they come short of their point_ gain not their end_ because they would not ask counsel about the way. If men will not take time and pains to deliberate with themselves_ or are so confident of their own judgment that they scorn to consult with others_ they are not likely to bring any thing considerable to pass; circumstances defeat them which_ with a little consultation_ might have been foreseen and obviated. It is a good rule_ both in public and domestic affairs_ to do nothing rashly and of one's own head. Plus vident oculi quam oculus—Many eyes see more than one. That often proves best which was least our own doing.,20250223
Of what ill consequence slothfulness is both to private and public affairs (v. 18): By much slothfulness and idleness of the hands_ the neglect of business_ and the love of ease and pleasure_ the building decays_ drops through first_ and by degrees drops down. If it be not kept well covered_ and care be not taken to repair the breaches_ as any happen_ it will rain in_ and the timber will rot_ and the house will become unfit to dwell in. It is so with the family and the affairs of it; if men cannot find in their hearts to take pains in their callings_ to tend their shops and look after their own business_ they will soon run in debt and go behind-hand_ and_ instead of making what they have more for their children_ will make it less. It is so with the public; if the king be a child and will take no care_ if the princes eat in the morning and will take no pains_ the affairs of the nation suffer loss_ and its interests are prejudiced_ its honour is sullied_ its power is weakened_ its borders are encroached upon_ the course of justice is obstructed_ the treasure is exhausted_ and all its foundations are out of course_ and all this through the slothfulness of self-seeking of those that should be the repairers of its breaches and the restorers of paths to dwell in_ Isa. lviii. 12.,20250223
Of wisdom: A man of understanding_ that has rule over his own spirit_ if he be provoked_ holds his peace_ that he may neither give vent to his passion nor kindle the passion of others by any opprobrious language or peevish reflections,20250223
Of writing many books. __If what I have written_ serve not to convince thee of the vanity of the world_ and the necessity of being religious_ neither wouldst thou be convinced if I should write ever so much.__ If the end be not attained in the use of those books of scripture which God has blessed us with_ neither should we obtain the end_ if we had twice as many more; nay_ if we had so many that the whole world could not contain them (John xxi. and much study of them would but confound us_ and would rather be a weariness to the flesh than any advantage to the soul. We have as much as God saw fit to give us_ saw fit for us_ and saw us fit for. Much less can it be expected that those who will not by these be admonished should be wrought upon by other writings. Let men write ever so many books for the conduct of human life_ write till they have tired themselves with much study_ they cannot give better instructions than those we have from the word of God. Or_ ,20250223
Often they sustain hurt by their riches. They would not be envied_ would not be robbed_ if they were not rich. It is the fat beast that is led first to the slaughter. A very rich man (as one observes) has sometimes been excepted out of a general pardon_ both as to life and estate_ merely on account of his vast and overgrown estate; so riches often take away the life of the owners thereof_ Prov. i. 19.,20250223
Old men become mindless and listless_ and the pleasures of sense are to them tasteless and sapless.,20250223
Old people grow hard of hearing_ and unapt to distinguish sounds and voices. Tenthly_ They are afraid of that which is high_ afraid to go to the top of any high place_ either because_ for want of breath_ they cannot reach it_ or_ their heads being giddy or their legs failing them_ they dare not venture to it_ or they frighten themselves with fancying that that which is high will fall upon them. Fear is in the way; they can neither ride nor walk with their former boldness_ but are afraid of every thing that lies in their way_ lest it throw them down. Eleventhly_ The almond-tree flourishes. The old man's hair has grown white_ so that his head looks like an almond-tree in the blossom. The almond-tree blossoms before any other tree_ and therefore fitly shows what haste old age makes in seizing upon men; it prevents their expectations and comes faster upon them than they thought of. Gray hairs are here and there upon them_ and they perceive it not. Twelfthly_ The grasshopper is a burden and desire fails. Old men can bear nothing; the lightest thing sits heavily upon them_ both on their bodies and on their minds_ a little thing sinks and breaks them. Perhaps the grasshopper was some food that was looked upon to be very light of digestion (John Baptist's meat was locusts)_ but even that lies heavily upon an old man's stomach_ and therefore desire fails_ he has no appetite to his meat_ neither shall he regard the desire of woman_ as that king_ Dan. xi,20250223
Old people therefore_ if they would preserve their honour_ must still hold fast their integrity_ and then their gray hairs are indeed a crown to them; they are worthy of double honour. Grace is the glory of old age.,20250223
Omniscient; for he looks to the ends of the earth_ both in place and time; distant ages_ distant regions_ are under his view. We do not understand our own way_ much less can we understand God's way_ because we are short-sighted. How little do we know of what is doing in the world_ much less of what will be done? But the eyes of the Lord are in every place; nay_ they run to and fro through the earth. Nothing is_ or can be_ hidden from him; and therefore the reasons why some wicked people prosper remarkably and others are remarkably punished in this world_ which are secret to us_ are known to him. One day's events_ and one man's affairs_ have such a reference to_ and such a dependence upon_ another's_ that he only to whom all events and all affairs are naked and open_ and who sees the whole at one entire and certain view_ is a competent Judge of every part. ,20250223
On the other hand_ if he were a wicked man and an evil-doer_ God would not help him_ but leave him to perish in his present distresses (v.,20250223
Once more Elihu begs the patience of the auditory_ and Job's particularly_ for he has not said all that he has to say_ but he will not detain them long. Stand about me a little (so some read it)_ v.,20250223
One can do no good to them. While many are fed by the lips of the righteous_ fools die for want of wisdom; and fools indeed they are to die for want of that which they might so easily come by. Fools die for want of a heart (so the word is); they perish for want of consideration and resolution; they have no heart to do any thing for their own good. While the righteous feed others fools starve themselves.,20250223
One dies suddenly_ in his full strength_ not weakened by age or sickness (v. being wholly at ease and quiet_ under no apprehension at all of the approach of death_ nor in any fear of it; but_ on the contrary_ because his breasts are full of milk and his bones moistened with marrow (v. that is_ he is healthful and vigorous_ and of a good constitution (like a milch cow that is fat and in good liking)_ he counts upon nothing but to live many years in mirth and pleasure. Thus fair does he bid for life_ and yet he is cut off in a moment by the stroke of death. Note_ It is a common thing for persons to be taken away by death when they are in their full strength_ in the highest degree of health_ when they least expect death_ and think themselves best armed against it_ and are ready not only to set death at a distance_ but to set it at defiance. Let us therefore never be secure; for we have known many well and dead in the same week_ the same day_ the same hour_ nay_ perhaps_ the same minute. Let us therefore be always ready. ,20250223
One great kindness God designed men_ in giving them his law_ was to preserve them from this sin_ v,20250223
One may trace the leviathan under water by the bubbles on the surface; and yet who can take that advantage against him in pursuing him? Men track hares in the snow and kill them_ but he that tracks the leviathan dares not come near him.,20250223
One thing he mentions_ which aggravated his affliction_ that it surprised him when he looked for peace. But two things gave him some relief:—1. That his troubles would not follow him to the grave_ ver. 24,20250223
One volume more_ containing the prophetical books_ will finish the Old Testament_ if the Lord continue my life_ and leisure_ and ability of mind and body for this work. It is begun_ and I find it will be larger than any of the other volumes_ and longer in the doing; but_ as God by his grace shall furnish me for it and assist me in it (without which grace I am nothing_ less than nothing_ worse than nothing)_ it shall be carried on with all convenient speed; and sat citò_ si sat benè—if with sufficient ability_ it will be with sufficient speed. I desire the prayers of my friends that God would minister seed to the sower and bread to the eaters (Isa. lv. that he would multiply the seed sown and increase the fruits of our righteousness (2 Cor. ix. that so he who sows and those who reap may rejoice together (John iv. 36); and the great Lord of the harvest shall have the glory of all.,20250223
One would have thought that such an excellent confession of faith as Job made_ in the close of the foregoing chapter_ would satisfy his friends_ or at least mollify them; but they do not seem to have taken any notice of it_ and therefore Zophar here takes his turn_ enters the lists with Job_ and attacks him with as much vehemence as before.,20250223
One would not have thought that Job_ when he was in so much pain and misery_ could banter his friend as he does here and make himself merry with the impertinency of his discourse. Bildad thought that he had made a fine speech_ that the matter was so weighty_ and the language so fine_ that he had gained the reputation both of an oracle and of an orator; but Job peevishly enough shows that his performance was not so valuable as he thought it and ridicules him for it. He shows_,20250223
One would think that men of sense should always be men of substance_ and that those who know how to live in the world should not only have a plentiful maintenance_ but get great estates; and yet it does not always prove so; even bread is not always to the wise_ much less riches always to men of understanding. Many ingenious men_ and men of business_ who were likely to thrive in the world_ have strangely gone backward and come to nothing. ,20250223
One would think that the lightest of foot should_ in running_ win the prize; and yet the race is not always to the swift; some accident happens to retard them_ or they are too secure_ and therefore remiss_ and let those that are slower get the start of them. ,20250223
One would think that those who understand men_ and have the art of management_ should always get preferment and obtain the smiles of great men; but many ingenious men have been disappointed_ and have spent their days in obscurity_ nay_ have fallen into disgrace_ and perhaps have ruined themselves by those very methods by which they hoped to raise themselves_ for favour is not always to men of skill_ but fools are favoured and wise men frowned upon.,20250223
One would think that_ in fighting_ the most numerous and powerful army should be always victorious_ and_ in single combat_ that the bold and mighty champion should win the laurel; but the battle is not always to the strong; a host of Philistines was once put to flight by Jonathan and his man; one of you shall chase a thousand; the goodness of the cause has often carried the day against the most formidable power. ,20250223
One would wonder how any man can take pleasure in making all about him afraid of him_ yet there are those that do.,20250223
Openness and ostentation are a mark of folly. If fools have a little smattering of knowledge_ they take all occasions_ though very foreign_ to produce it_ and bring it in by head and shoulders. Or the folly that is in the midst of fools is made known by their forwardness to talk. Many a foolish man takes more pains to show his folly than a wise man thinks it worth his while to take to show his wisdom.,20250223
Opportunity is to direct and quicken duty. That is to be done which our hand finds to do_ which occasion calls for; and an active hand will always find something to do that will turn to a good account. What must be done_ of necessity_ our hand will here find a price in it for the doing of_ Prov. xvii,20250223
Oppression_ and the violent invasion of other people's rights_ ver. 38-40. And towards the close_ he appeals to God's judgment concerning his integrity_ ver. 35-37. Now_,20250223
Or (as some understand it) he made the wicked to be employed by him as the instruments of his wrath in the day of evil_ when he brings judgments on the world. He makes some use even of wicked men_ as of other things_ to be his sword_ his hand (Ps. xvii. 13_ flagellum Dei—the scourge of God. The king of Babylon is called his servant.,20250223
Or above all keepings; we must keep our hearts with more care and diligence than we keep any thing else. We must keep our eyes (Job xxxi. 1)_ keep our tongues (Ps. xxxiv.,20250223
Or darkness_ that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. 12 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars_ how high they are! 13 And thou sayest_ How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 14 Thick clouds are a covering to him_ that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.,20250223
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone_ and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof,20250223
Or he is like a man absconding for debt_ who thinks every man a bailiff. Fear came in_ at first_ with sin (Gen. iii. 10) and still attends it. Even in prosperity he is apprehensive that the destroyer will come upon him_ either some destroying angel sent of God to avenge his quarrel or some of his injured subjects who will be their own avengers. Those who are the terror of the mighty in the land of the living usually go down slain to the pit (Ezek. xxxii. the expectation of which makes them a terror to themselves. This is further set forth (v. 22): He is_ in his own apprehension_ waited for of the sword; for he knows that he who killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword_ Rev. xiii,20250223
Or into the hand of a wicked man_ meaning (as bishop Patrick and the Assembly's Annotations conjecture) some noted tyrant then living in those parts_ whose great wickedness and great prosperity were well known both to Job and his friends. The wicked have the earth given them_ but the righteous have heaven given them_ and which is better—heaven without earth or earth without heaven? God_ in his providence_ advances wicked men_ while he covers the faces of those who are fit to be judges_ who are wise and good_ and qualified for government_ and buries them alive in obscurity_ perhaps suffers them to be run down and condemned_ and to have their faces covered as criminals by those wicked ones into whose hand the earth is given. We daily see that this is done; if it be not God that does it_ where and who is he that does it? To whom can it be ascribed but to him that rules in the kingdoms of men_ and gives them to whom he will? Dan. iv,20250223
Or it may be taken there generally for all sin. Many extenuate their sins with this_ They were folly; but Solomon sees wickedness in those follies_ an offence to God and a wrong to conscience. This is wickedness_ Jer.,20250223
Or of a wicked heart disguising itself with burning lips_ burning with the professions of love and friendship_ and even persecuting a man with flatteries; this is like a potsherd covered with the scum or dross of silver_ with which one that is weak may be imposed upon_ as if it were of some value_ but a wise man is soon aware of the cheat. This sense agrees with the following verses.,20250223
Or the believer speaks to those that were professors at large in the church_ but not of it_ or to weak Christians_ babes in Christ_ that labour under much ignorance_ infirmity_ and mistake_ not perfectly instructed_ and yet willing to be taught in the things of God. She observed these by-standers look disdainfully upon her because of her blackness_ in respect both of sins and sufferings_ upon the account of which they though she had little reason to expect the kisses she wished for (v. 2) or to expect that they should join with her in her joys_ v,20250223
Or the knowledge which holy men have_ which was taught by the holy prophets_ of those things which holy men spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost_ this is understanding; it is the best and most useful understanding_ will stand us in most stead and turn to the best account.,20250223
Or the word soul must be understood_ and so Koheleth is_,20250223
Or they shall be made miserable with the mischiefs that shall come upon them. Those that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. Some read the whole verse thus_ There shall no evil happen to the just_ though the wicked be filled with mischief and spite against them. They shall be safe under the protection of Heaven_ though hell itself break loose upon them.,20250223
Or this may refer to all that Job had said. Having shown the absurdity of some passages in his discourse_ he concludes that there were many other passages which were in like manner the fruits of his ignorance and mistake. He did not_ as his other friends_ condemn him for a hypocrite_ but charged him only with Moses's sin_ speaking unadvisedly with his lips when his spirit was provoked. When at any time we do so (and who is there that offends not in word?) it is a mercy to be told of it_ and we must take it patiently and kindly as Job did_ not repeating_ but recanting_ what we have said amiss.,20250223
Or with princes that had gold_ who filled their houses with silver: 16 Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. 17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. 18 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. 19 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.,20250223
Or_ ,20250223
Or_  Of the change at death. __If a man die_ shall he live again? No_ not such a life as he now lives; and therefore I will patiently wait until that change comes which will put a period to my calamities_ and not impatiently wish for the anticipation of it_ as I have done.__ Observe here_ ,20250223
Or_ __Draw me__ (says the believing soul) __and then I will not only follow thee myself as fast as I can_ but will bring all mine along with me: We will run after thee_ I and the virgins that love thee (v.,20250223
Or_ 2. In intimacy of acquaintance with God (v. 8): __Hast thou heard the secret of God? Dost thou pretend to be of the cabinet-council of heaven_ that thou canst give better reasons than others can for God's proceedings?__ There are secret things of God_ which belong not to us_ and which therefore we must not pretend to account for. Those are daringly presumptuous who do. He also represents him_ ,20250223
Or_ 3. Of the satisfaction they had in each other_ with reference to the great work of man's redemption. The Father delighted in the Son_ as Mediator between him and man_ was well-pleased with what he proposed (Matt. iii. and therefore loved him because he undertook to lay down his life for the sheep; he put a confidence in him that he would go through his work_ and not fail nor fly off. The Son also rejoiced always before him_ delighted to do his will (Ps. xl. adhered closely to his undertaking_ as one that was well-satisfied in it_ and_ when it came to the setting to_ expressed as much satisfaction in it as ever_ saying_ Lo_ I come_ to do as in the volume of the book it is written of me.,20250223
Or_ Secondly_ __They brought me into trouble_ imposed that upon me which was toilsome_ and burdensome_ and very disgraceful.__ Keeping the vineyards was base servile work_ and very laborious_ Isa. lxi,20250223
Or_ if it be done under the colour of law and justice_ that is oppressing the afflicted in the gate_ where they ought to be protected from wrong and to have justice done them against those that oppress them.,20250223
Other riches are not so durable as these are: __Look well to thy flocks and herds_ thy estate in the country and the stock upon that_ for these are staple commodities_ which_ in a succession_ will be for ever_ whereas riches in trade and merchandise will not be so; the crown itself may perhaps not be so sure to thy family as thy flocks and herds.__ ,20250223
Other such instances_ no doubt_ there were_ which are not on record.,20250223
Others also had like experience of comfort in Christ_ as it follows there (Ps. xxxiv.,20250223
Others make it to denote the reason of their sin: They say unto God_ Depart_ asking what the Almighty can do to them. __What has he done to oblige us? What can he do in a way of wrath to make us miserable_ or in a way of favour to make us happy?__ As they argue_ Zeph. i,20250223
Others of them shall die by famine (v. 14): His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. He thought he had secured to them large estates_ but it may happen that they may be reduced to poverty_ so as not to have the necessary supports of life_ at least not to live comfortably. They shall be so needy that they shall not have a competency of necessary food_ and so greedy_ or so discontented_ that what they have they shall not be satisfied with_ because not so much_ or not so dainty_ as what they have been used to. You eat_ but you have not enough_ Hag.,20250223
Others rather take it for a serious question_ and suppose that those who put it intended_ ,20250223
Others think her beloved gives the account of her. __I will tell you what you shall see in the Shulamite; you shall see as noble a sight as that of two armies_ or two parts of the same army_ drawn out in rank and file; not only as an army with banners_ but as two armies_ with a majesty double to what was before spoken; she is as Mahanaim_ as the two hosts which Jacob saw (Gen. xxxii. 1_ a host of saints and a host of angels ministering to them; the church militant_ the church triumphant.__ Behold two armies; in both the church appears beautiful.,20250223
Otherwise_ Seek and you shall find_ and with it shall find both life and honour_ everlasting life and honour_ the crown of righteousness.,20250223
Our Redeemer will at that day stand upon the earth_ or over the earth_ to summon the dead out of their graves_ and determine them to an unchangeable state; for to him all judgment is committed. He shall stand_ at the last_ on the dust to which this earth will be reduced by the conflagration.,20250223
Our Saviour has let us know how little pleasure the rich man in hell had in his house after him_ when the remembrance of the good things he had received in his life-time would not cool his tongue_ but added much to his misery_ as did also the sorrow he was in lest his five brethren_ whom he left in his house after him_ should follow him to that place of torment_ Luke xvi. 25-28. So little will the gain of the world profit him that has lost his soul.,20250223
Our best deliverance from every false way: The righteousness of the upright shall be armour of proof to them_ to deliver them from the allurements of the devil and the world_ and from their menaces.,20250223
Our best direction in the right way_ in every doubtful case to say to us_ This is the way_ walk in it. He that acts without a guide looks right on and sees his way before him,20250223
Our comfort depends very much upon the testimony of our own consciences_ for us or against us. The belly is here put for the conscience_ as ch. xx,20250223
Our danger is from the rulers of the darkness of this world_ but we are safe in the armour of light.,20250223
Our enquiries into the former must be checked_ into the latter quickened_ for that is it which is our concern.,20250223
Our finite understandings cannot fathom his counsels_ apprehend his motions_ or comprehend the measures he takes; we are therefore incompetent judges of God's proceedings_ because we know not what he does or what he designs. The arcana imperii—secrets of government_ are things above us_ which therefore we must not pretend to expound or comment upon. ,20250223
Our great care must be to pay our rent for what we hold of Christ's vineyard_ and to see that we do not go behind-hand_ nor disappoint the messengers he sends to receive the fruits (Matt. xxi. 34): Thou_ O Solomon! must have 1000_ and shalt have. The main of the profits belong to Christ; to him and his praise all our fruits must be dedicated,20250223
Our heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit to those that ask him. ,20250223
Our heavenly inheritance was mortgaged by sin; we are ourselves utterly unable to redeem it; Christ is near of kin to us_ the next kinsman that is able to redeem; he has paid our debt_ satisfied God's justice for sin_ and so has taken off the mortgage and made a new settlement of the inheritance. Our persons also want a Redeemer; we are sold for sin_ and sold under sin; our Lord Jesus has wrought out a redemption for us_ and proclaims redemption for us_ and proclaims redemption to us_ and so he is truly the Redeemer. ,20250223
Our interest in the Redeemer is a thing that may be known; and_ where it is known_ it may be triumphed in_ as sufficient to balance all our griefs: I know (observe with what an air of assurance he speaks it_ as one confident of this very thing)_ I know that my Redeemer lives. His friends have often charged him with ignorance or vain knowledge; but he knows enough_ and knows to good purpose_ who knows Christ to be his Redeemer. ,20250223
Our life is going; for the breath of life is going. It is continually going forth; it is in our nostrils (Isa. ii. the door at which it entered (Gen. ii. 7); there it is upon the threshold_ ready to depart. Perhaps Job's distemper obstructed his breathing_ and short breath will_ after a while_ be no breath. Let the Anointed of the Lord be the breath of our nostrils_ and let us get spiritual life breathed into us_ and that breath will never be corrupted. ,20250223
Our parents directed us to it_ put it into our hands_ trained us up in the knowledge and observance of it_ its original and obligation being most sacred. We believe indeed_ not for their saying_ for we have tried it ourselves and find it to be of God; but we were beholden to them for recommending it to us_ and see all the reason in the world to continue in the things we have learned_ knowing of whom we have learned them. ,20250223
Our reward for well-doing is very certain. __Though thou cast it upon the waters_ and it seem lost_ thou thinkest thou hast given thy good word with it and art likely never to hear of it again_ yet thou shalt find it after many days_ as the husbandman finds his seed again in a plentiful harvest and the merchant his venture in a rich return. It is not lost_ but well laid out_ and well laid up; it brings in full interest in the present gifts of God's providence_ and graces and comforts of his Spirit; and the principal is sure_ laid up in heaven_ for it is lent to the Lord.__ Seneca_ a heathen_ could say_ Nihil magis possidere me credam_ quam bene donata—I possess nothing so completely as that which I have given away. Hochabeo quodcunque dedi; hæ sunt divitiæ certæ in quacunque sortis humanæ levitate—Whatever I have imparted I still possess; these riches remain with me through all the vicissitudes of life. __Thou shalt find it_ perhaps not quickly_ but after many days; the return may be slow_ but it is sure and will be so much the more plentiful.__ Wheat_ the most valuable grain_ lies longest in the ground. Long voyages make the best returns.,20250223
Our riches will fail us when we are in the greatest need: He that trusts in them_ as if they would secure him the favour of God and be his protection and portion_ shall fall_ as a man who lays his weight on a broken reed_ which will not only disappoint him_ but run into his hand and pierce him,20250223
Our righteousness will stand us in stead when our riches fail us: The righteous shall then flourish as a branch_ the branch of righteousness_ like a tree whose leaf shall not wither_ Ps. i,20250223
Our souls are our fields and vineyards_ which we are every one of us to take care of_ to dress_ and to keep. They are capable of being improved with good husbandry; that may be got out of them which will be fruit abounding to our account. We are charged with them_ to occupy them till our Lord come; and a great deal of care and pains it is requisite that we should take about them. ,20250223
Our time is ending: My days are extinct_ are put out_ as a candle which_ from the first lighting_ is continually wasting and burning down_ and will by degrees burn out of itself_ but may by a thousand accidents be extinguished. Such is life. It concerns us therefore carefully to redeem the days of time_ and to spend them in getting ready for the days of eternity_ which will never be extinct. ,20250223
Our translation gives this verse a different reading in the text and in the margin; and accordingly it expresses either,20250223
Our translation seems to take it as an excitement to diligence in the pursuit of wisdom. If we would get knowledge or grace_ we must desire it_ as that which we need and which will be of great advantage to us_ 1 Cor. xii,20250223
Our wills and affections must be subject to them and must in every thing conform to them. Not only our heads_ but our hearts_ must keep God's commandments; in them_ as in the ark of the testimony_ both the tables of the law must be deposited.,20250223
Out of our sight_ to teach us not to set our eyes upon them_ Prov. xxiii,20250223
Outward Prosperity of the Wicked. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Outward expressions of godly sorrow well become penitents; Job repented in dust and ashes. These_ without an inward change_ do but mock God; but_ where they come from sincere contrition of soul_ the sinner by them gives glory to God_ takes shame to himself_ and may be instrumental to bring others to repentance. Job's afflictions had brought him to the ashes (ch. ii. 8_ he sat down among the ashes)_ but now his sins brought him thither. True penitents mourn for their sins as heartily as ever they did for any outward afflictions_ and are in bitterness as for an only son of a first-born_ for they are brought to see more evils in their sins than in their troubles. ,20250223
Outward grievances are tolerable as long as the mind enjoys itself and is at ease. Many infirmities_ many calamities_ we are liable to in this world_ in body_ name_ and estate_ which a man may bear_ and bear up under_ if he have but good conduct and courage_ and be able to act with reason and resolution_ especially if he have a good conscience_ and the testimony of that be for him; and_ if the spirit of a man will sustain the infirmity_ much more will the spirit of a Christian_ or rather the Spirit of God witnessing and working with our spirits in a day of trouble,20250223

Parents are here cautioned against a foolish indulgence of their children that are untoward and viciously inclined_ and that discover such an ill temper of mind as is not likely to be cured but by severity. 1. Do not say that it is all in good time to correct them; no_ as soon as ever there appears a corrupt disposition in them check it immediately_ before it gets head_ and takes root_ and is hardened into a habit: Chasten thy son while there is hope_ for perhaps_ if he be let alone awhile_ he will be past hope_ and a much greater chastening will not do that which now a less would effect. It is easiest plucking up weeds as soon as they spring up_ and the bullock that is designed for the yoke should be betimes accustomed to it,20250223
Parents_ in educating their children_ must consider,20250223
Particular believers are amiable_ nay_ admirable_ and divine grace is to be admired in them_ when by the power of that grace they are brought up from the wilderness_ leaning with a holy confidence and complacency upon Jesus Christ their beloved. This bespeaks the beauty of a soul_ and the wonders of divine grace,20250223
Particular directions for the attaining and preserving of wisdom_ and bringing forth the fruits of it_ ver. 20-27. So plainly_ so pressingly_ is the case laid before us_ that we shall be for ever inexcusable if we perish in our folly.,20250223
Particularly the improving or neglecting opportunities_ ch. vi. 6; x. 5.,20250223
Particularly to hate pride and passion_ those two common and dangerous sins. Conceitedness of ourselves_ pride and arrogancy_ are sins which Christ hates_ and so do all those who have the Spirit of Christ; every one hates them in others_ but we must hate them in ourselves. The froward mouth_ peevishness towards others_ God hates_ because it is such an enemy to the peace of mankind_ and therefore we should hate it. Be it spoken to the honour of religion that_ however it is unjustly accused_ it is so far from making men conceited and sour that there is nothing more directly contrary to it than pride and passion_ nor which it teaches us more to detest.,20250223
Passion is folly: A fool is known by his anger (so some read it); not but that a wise man may be angry when there is just cause for it_ but then he has his anger under check and direction_ is lord of his anger_ whereas a fool's anger lords it over him. He that_ when he is provoked_ breaks out into indecent expressions_ in words or behaviour_ whose passion alters his countenance_ makes him outrageous_ and leads him to forget himself_ Nabal certainly is his name and folly is with him. A fool's indignation is known in the day; he proclaims it openly_ whatever company he is in. Or it is known in the day he is provoked; he cannot defer showing his resentments. Those that are soon angry_ that are quickly put into a flame by the least spark_ have not that rule which they ought to have over their own spirits,20250223
Passion the great make-bate. Thence come wars and fightings. Anger strikes the fire which sets cities and churches into a flame: A wrathful man_ with his peevish passionate reflections_ stirs up strife_ and sets people together by the ears; he gives occasion to others to quarrel_ and takes the occasion that others give_ though ever so trifling. When men carry their resentments too far_ one quarrel still produces another,20250223
Passionate men are justly laughed at. Men who are peevish and touchy_ and are soon angry upon every the least provocation_ deal foolishly; they say and do that which is ridiculous_ and so expose themselves to contempt; they themselves cannot but be ashamed of it when the heat is over. The consideration of this should engage those especially who are in reputation for wisdom and honour with the utmost care to bridle their passion,20250223
Pay it; perform what thou hast promised; bring to God what thou hast dedicated and devoted to him: Pay that which thou hast vowed; pay it in full and keep not back any part of the price; pay it in kind_ do not alter it or change it_ so the law was_ Lev. xxvii,20250223
Peace and piety in the family will make it so. __Thou shalt know and be assured that thy tabernacle is and shall be in peace; thou mayest be confident both of its present and its future prosperity.__ That peace is thy tabernacle (so the word is); peace is the house in which those dwell who dwell in God_ and are at home in him. __Thou shalt visit__ (that is_ enquire into the affairs of) __thy habitation_ and take a review of them_ and shalt not sin.__ ,20250223
People are never long easy and satisfied: There is no end_ no rest_ of all the people; they are continually fond of changes_ and know not what they would have,20250223
Perceiving quickly that it was folly to give himself to wine_ he next tried the most costly entertainments and amusements of princes and great men. He had a vast income; the revenue of his crown was very great_ and he laid it out so as might most please his own humour and make him look great.,20250223
Perhaps Job was so clear_ and so well satisfied_ in the goodness of his own cause_ that he thought_ if he had not convinced_ yet he had at least silenced all his three friends; but_ it seems he had not: in this chapter they begin a second attack upon him_ each of them charging him afresh with as much vehemence as before. It is natural to us to be fond of our own sentiments_ and therefore to be firm to them_ and with difficulty to be brought to recede from them. Eliphaz here keeps close to the principles upon which he had condemned Job_ and_,20250223
Perhaps a wicked man's wealth is fruit which he did not labour for_ but came easily by_ but it tends to sin. He makes it the food and fuel of his lusts_ his pride and luxury; he gets hurt with it and not good; he gets hurt by it and is hardened by it in his wicked ways. The things of this world are good or evil_ life or death_ as they are used_ and as those are that have them.,20250223
Perhaps he has not so good an estate_ so good a trade_ nor such good preferment as the fool has. Nay_ suppose them to be equal in their possessions_ what can a wise man_ a scholar_ a wit_ a politician_ squeeze out of his estate more than needful supplies? and a half-witted man may do this. A fool can fare as well and relish it_ can dress as well_ and make as good a figure in any public appearance_ as a wise man; so that if there were not pleasures and honour peculiar to the mind_ which the wise man has more than the fool_ as to this world they would be upon a level.,20250223
Perhaps he praises him thus for the good he had done that he might make the intended reproof the more passable with him. Just commendation is a good preface to a just reprehension_ will help to remove prejudices_ and will show that the reproof comes not from ill will. Paul praised the Corinthians before he chided them_ 1 Cor. xi,20250223
Perhaps he pretends fear of wanting_ as an excuse of his covetous practices; and justly may he be brought to this extremity at last. We read of those who were full_ but have hired out themselves for bread (1 Sam. ii. which this sinner will not do. He cannot dig; he is too fat (v. 27): but to beg he may well be ashamed. See Ps. cix,20250223
Perhaps he was given to fight when he was young_ and then made nothing of a cut or a bruise in a fray; but he feels it in his bones long after. But can he get no ease_ no relief? No_ he is likely to carry his pains and diseases with him to the grave_ or rather they are likely to carry him thither_ and so the sins of his youth shall lie down with him in the dust; the very putrefying of his body in the grave is to him the effect of sin (ch. xxiv. so that his iniquity is upon his bones there_ Ezek. xxxii.,20250223
Perhaps it intimates the very dreadful apprehensions which those have of death as a destroying thing_ when it stares them in the face_ who_ when it was at a distance_ made light of it. All agree when it comes to the point_ whatever they thought of it before_ that it is a serious thing to die.,20250223
Perhaps it is spoken carefully: __I have been hard at work_ going to and fro___ or (as some read it) __searching about in the earth___ really in quest of an opportunity to do mischief. He walks abut seeking whom he may devour. It concerns us therefore to be sober and vigilant.,20250223
Perhaps it is spoken fretfully_ and with discontent. He had been walking to and fro_ and could find no rest_ but was as much a fugitive and a vagabond as Cain in the land of Nod. ,20250223
Perhaps it is spoken proudly_ and with an air of haughtiness_ as if he were indeed the prince of this world_ as if the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them were his (Luke iv. and he had now been walking in circuit through his own territories. ,20250223
Perhaps some of them withdrew from him because they thought him a hypocrite_ but_ now that his integrity was made manifest_ they returned to him and to communion with him again. When God was friendly to him they were all willing to be friendly too_ Ps. cxix. 74_ 79. Others of them_ it may be_ withdrew because he was poor_ and sore_ and a rueful spectacle_ but now that he began to recover they were willing to renew their acquaintance with him. Swallow-friends_ that are gone in winter_ will return in the spring_ though their friendship is of little value. ,20250223
Perhaps the rebuke which God had given to Eliphaz and the other two for their unkindness to Job awakened the rest of his friends to return to their duty. Reproofs to others we should thus take as admonitions and instructions to us,20250223
Perhaps there might be at that time_ and in that country_ a more stately breed of horses than any we have now,20250223
Perhaps they may leave us suddenly_ when we have taken a great deal of pains for them and begin to take a great deal of pride and pleasure in them. The covetous man sits hatching upon his wealth_ and brooding over it_ till it is fledged_ as the young ones under the hen_ and then it is gone. Or_ as if a man should be fond of a flight of wild-fowl that light in his field_ and call them his own because they are upon his ground_ whereas_ if he offers to come near them_ they take wing immediately and are gone to another man's field. ,20250223
Perhaps we may meet with trouble in that very thing wherein we promise ourselves the greatest satisfaction and advantage; as the fishes and the birds are drawn into the snare and net by the bait laid to allure them_ which they greedily catch at_ so are the sons of men often snared in an evil time_ when it falls suddenly upon them_ before they are aware. And these things too come alike to all. Men often find their bane where they sought their bless_ and catch their death where they thought to find a prize. Let us therefore never be secure_ but always ready for changes_ that_ though they may be sudden_ they may be no surprise or terror to us.,20250223

Piety is a sure protection. If men be sincerely righteous_ the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. He will_ by the power of his grace in them_ that principle of justice_ keep them from the evil of sin; so that_ though they be tempted_ yet they shall not be overcome by the temptation_ and though they may come into trouble_ into many troubles_ yet to them those troubles shall have no evil in them_ whatever they have to others (Ps. xci. for they shall be overruled to work for their good,20250223

Pleasure and Advantages of Wisdom.,20250223
Pleasure and liberty ill become a fool: Delight is not seemly for such a one. A man that has not wisdom and grace has no right nor title to true joy_ and therefore it is unseemly. It ill becomes those that do not delight in God to delight in any thing_ nor how to manage themselves_ and therefore they do but expose themselves. It becomes ungracious fools to be afflicted_ and mourn_ and weep_ not to laugh and be merry; rebukes are more proper for them than delights. Delight is seemly for a man of business_ to refresh him when he is fatigued_ but not for a fool_ that lives an idle life and abuses his recreations. The prosperity of fools discovers their folly and destroys them.,20250223
Pleasures and Advantages of Wisdom.,20250223
Politic_ designing_ self-disguising sinners: He that winks with the eye_ as if he took no notice of you_ when at the same time he is watching an opportunity to do you an ill turn_ that makes signs to his accomplices when to come into assist him in executing his wicked projects_ which are all carried on by trick and artifice_ causes sorrow both to others and to himself. Ingenuity will be no excuse for iniquity_ but the sinner must either repent or do worse_ either rue it or be ruined by it,20250223
Pompous prefaces_ like the teeming mountain_ often introduce poor performances; but Elihu's discourse here does not disappoint the expectations which his preface had raised. It is substantial_ and lively_ and very much to the purpose. He had_ in the foregoing chapter_ said what he had to say to Job's three friends; and now he comes up close to Job himself and directs his speech to him.,20250223
Poor Job goes on here to upbraid his friends with their unkindness and the hard usage they gave him. He here appeals to themselves concerning several things which tended both to justify him and to condemn them. If they would but think impartially_ and speak as they thought_ they could not but own_,20250223
Poor Job sadly complains here,20250223
Poor Job's wound's were yet bleeding_ his sore still runs and ceases not_ but none of his friends bring him any oil_ any balm; Zophar_ the third_ pours into them as much vinegar as the two former had done.,20250223
Poor people may perish for want of clothing as well as for want of food—for want of clothing to lie in by night or to go abroad in by day. If Job knew of any that were in this distress_ he was forward to relieve them_ and instead of giving rich and gaudy liveries to his servants_ while the poor were turned off with rags that were ready to be thrown to the dunghill_ he had good warm strong clothes made on purpose for them of the fleece of his sheep (v. so that their loins_ whenever they girt those garments about them_ blessed him; they commended his charity_ blessed God for him_ and prayed God to bless him. Job's sheep were burned with fire from heaven_ but this was his comfort that_ when he had them_ he came honestly by them_ and used them charitably_ fed the poor with their flesh and clothed them with their wool.,20250223
Poor people think themselves undone because they are poor; but it is their mistake: The destruction of the poor is their poverty; it sinks their spirits_ and ruins all their comforts; whereas a man may live very comfortably_ though he has but a little to live on_ if he be but content_ and keep a good conscience_ and live by faith.,20250223
Poor widows_ who while their husbands were living troubled nobody_ but now were forced to seek relief_ thou hast sent away empty from thy doors with a sad heart_ v,20250223
Poverty and want will certainly come upon those that are slothful in their business. If men neglect their affairs_ they not only will not go forward_ but they will go backward. He that leaves his concerns at sixes and sevens will soon see them go to wreck and ruin_ and bring his noble to nine-pence. Spiritual poverty comes upon those that are slothful in the service of God; those will want oil_ when they should use it_ that provide it not in their vessels. ,20250223
Poverty_ though many inconveniences to the body attend it_ has often a good effect upon the spirit_ for it makes men humble and submissive_ and mortifies their pride. It teaches them to use entreaties. When necessity forces men to beg it tells them they must not prescribe or demand_ but take what is given them and be thankful. At the throne of God's grace we are all poor_ and must use entreaties_ not answer_ but make application_ must sue sub forma pauperis—as a pauper,20250223
Pray for it_ take pains for it_ give diligence in the use of all appointed means to attain it. Wait at wisdom's gate_ Prov. viii,20250223
Present Impunity of Transgressors. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Presumption is folly. He who_ when he is warned of his danger_ rages and is confident_ furiously pushes on_ cannot bear to be checked_ bids defiance to the wrath and curse of God_ and_ fearless of danger_ persists in his rebellion_ makes bold with the occasions of sin_ and plays upon the precipice_ he is a fool_ for he acts against his reason and his interest_ and his ruin will quickly be the proof of his folly.,20250223
Pride and Humility.,20250223
Pride is the presage of ruin_ and ruin will at last be the punishment of pride; for before destruction men are commonly so infatuated by the just judgment of God that they are more haughty than ever_ that their ruin may be the sorer and the more surprising. Of_ if that do not always hold_ yet after the heart has been lifted up with pride_ a fall comes_ ch. xvi. 18,20250223
Pride will have a fall. Those that are of a haughty spirit_ that think of themselves above what is meet_ and look with contempt upon others_ that with their pride affront God and disquiet others_ will be brought down_ either by repentance or by ruin. It is the honour of God to humble the proud_ Job xl. 11_ 12. It is the act of justice that those who have lifted up themselves should be laid low. Pharaoh_ Sennacherib_ Nebuchadnezzar_ were instances of this. Men cannot punish pride_ but either admire it or fear it_ and therefore God will take the punishing of it into his own hands. Let him alone to deal with proud men,20250223
Probably God had sent Eliphaz this messenger and message some time or other_ when he was himself in an unquiet discontented frame_ to calm and pacify him. Note_ As we should comfort others with that wherewith we have been comforted (2 Cor. i. so we should endeavour to convince others with that which has been powerful to convince us. The people of God had not then any written word to quote_ and therefore God sometimes notified to them even common truths by the extraordinary ways of revelation. We that have Bibles have there (thanks be to God) a more sure word to depend upon than even visions and voices_ 2 Pet. i,20250223
Prodigality is very bad husbandry. Those are not only justly branded as fools among men_ but will give an uncomfortable account to God of the talents they are entrusted with_ who are wasters of their estates_ who live above what they have_ spend and give more than they can afford_ and so_ in effect_ throw away what they have_ and suffer it to run to waste,20250223
Proper Treatment of Fools.,20250223
Prosperity of the Wicked; Abuse of Earthly Prosperity. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Protection. Even those who walk uprightly may be brought into danger for the trial of their faith_ but God is_ and will be_ a buckler to them_ so that nothing that happens to them shall do them any real hurt_ or possess them with any terrific apprehensions; they are safe_ and they shall think themselves so. Fear not_ Abraham; I am thy shield. It is their way_ the paths of judgment in which they walk_ that the Lord knows_ and owns_ and takes care of. ,20250223
Proud and cruel men take a strange pleasure in ruins_ when they are of their own making_ in destroying cities (Ps. ix. 6) and triumphing in the destruction_ since they cannot make them their own but by making them ready to become heaps_ and frightening the inhabitants out of them. Note_ Those that aim to engross the world to themselves_ and grasp at all_ lose the comfort of all_ and make themselves miserable in the midst of all. How does this tyrant gain his point_ and make himself master of cities that have all the marks of antiquity upon them? We are told (v. 35) that he does it by malice and falsehood_ the two chief ingredients of his wickedness who was a liar and a murderer from the beginning_ They conceive mischief_ and then they effect it by preparing deceit_ pretending to protect those whom they design to subdue_ and making leagues of peace the more effectually to carry on the operations of war. From such wicked men God deliver all good men.,20250223
Proud men are frequently most proud_ and insolent_ and haughty_ just before their destruction_ so that it is a certain presage that they are upon the brink of it. When proud men set God's judgments at defiance_ and think themselves at the greatest distance from them_ it is a sign that they are at the door; witness the case of Benhadad and Herod. While the word was in the king's mouth_ Dan. iv,20250223
Proud people will certainly be abased and brought low; for pride goes before destruction. If they bend not_ they will break; if they humble not themselves by true repentance_ God will humble them_ to their everlasting confusion. The wicked will be trodden down in their place_ that is_ Wherever they are found_ though they pretend to have a place of their own_ and to have taken root in it_ yet even there they shall be trodden down_ and all the wealth_ and power_ and interest_ to which their place entitles them_ will not be their security. ,20250223
Prov. xi,20250223
Prudence gains men respect and success: He that handles a matter wisely (that is master of his trade and makes it to appear he understands what he undertakes_ that is considerate in his affairs_ and_ when he speaks or writes on any subject_ does it pertinently) shall find good_ shall come into good repute_ and perhaps may make a good hand of it,20250223

Rain sometimes turns into a judgment. It is a scourge to a sinful land; as once it was for the destruction of the whole world_ so it is now often for the correction or discipline of some parts of it_ by hindering seedness and harvest_ raising the waters_ and damaging the fruits. Some have said that our nation has received much more prejudice by the excess of rain than by the want of it. ,20250223
Red lips are comely_ and a sign of health_ as the paleness of the lips is a sign of faintness and weakness; her lips were the colour of scarlet_ but thin lips_ like a thread of scarlet. The next words explain it: Thy speech is comely_ always with grace_ good_ and to the use of edifying_ which adds much to the beauty of a Christian. When we praise God with our lips_ and with the mouth make confession of him to salvation_ then they are as a thread of scarlet. All our good works and good words must be washed in the blood of Christ_ dyed like the scarlet thread_ and then_ and not till then_ they are acceptable to God. The Chaldee applies it to the chief priest_ and his prayers for Israel on the day of atonement.,20250223

Rejoicing in her interest in him_ ver. 16,20250223
Relations must in a special manner be careful and tender of one another in affliction: A brother is born to succour a brother or sister in distress_ to whom he is joined so closely by nature that he may the more sensibly feel from their burdens_ and be the more strongly inclined and engaged_ as it were by instinct_ to help them. We must often consider what we were born for_ not only as men_ but as in such a station and relation. Who knows but we came into such a family for such a time as this? We do not answer the end of our relations if we do not do the duty of them. Some take it thus: A friend that loves at all times is born (that is_ becomes) a brother in adversity_ and is so to be valued.,20250223
Religion and loyalty must go together. As men_ it is our duty to honour our Creator_ to worship and reverence him_ and to be always in his fear; as members of a community_ incorporated for mutual benefit_ it is our duty to be faithful and dutiful to the government God has set over us_ Rom. xiii. 1_ 2. Those that are truly religious will be loyal_ in conscience towards God; the godly in the land will be the quite in the land; and those are not truly loyal_ or will be so no longer than is for their interest_ that are not religious. How should he be true to his prince that is false to his God? And_ if they come in competition_ it is an adjudged case_ we must obey God rather than men.,20250223
Religion is true wisdom_ and it makes men wise in every relation. He that conscientiously keeps the law is wise_ and he will be particularly a wise son_ that is_ will act discreetly towards his parents_ for the law of God teaches him to do so,20250223
Religion is very much the strength and support of the civil government; it teaches subjects their duty_ and so by it kings reign over them the more easily; it teaches kings their duty_ and so by it kings reign as they ought; they decree justice_ while they rule in the fear of God. Those rule well whom religion rules.,20250223
Religion itself is not a vain thing; if it be so to us_ we may thank ourselves for resting in the outside of it_ Jam. i. 26.,20250223
Religion lengthens men's lives and crowns their hopes. What man is he that loves life? Let him fear God_ and that will secure him from many things that would prejudice his life_ and secure to him life enough in this world and eternal life in the other; the fear of the Lord will add days more than was expected_ will add them endlessly_ will prolong them to the days of eternity. What man is he that would see good days? Let him be religious_ and then his days shall not only be many_ but happy_ very happy as well as very many_ for the hope of the righteous shall be gladness; they shall have what they hope for_ to their unspeakable satisfaction. It is something future and unseen that they place their happiness in (Rom. viii. 24_ not what they have in hand_ but what they have in hope_ and their hope will shortly be swallowed up in fruition_ and it will be their everlasting gladness.

He that deals faithfully with his friend_ in telling him of his faults_ though he may put him into some heat for the present_ and perhaps have hard words_ instead of thanks_ for his pains_ yet afterwards he will not only have the comfort in his own bosom of having done his duty_ but he also whom he reproved will acknowledge that it was a kindness_ will entertain a high opinion of his wisdom and faithfulness_ and look upon him as fit to be a friend. He that cries out against his surgeon for hurting him when he is searching his wound will yet pay him well_ and thank him too_ when he has cured it.,20250223

Rich and poor meet together at the bar of God's justice_ all guilty before God_ concluded under sin_ and shapen in iniquity_ the rich as much as the poor; and they meet at the throne of God's grace; the poor are as welcome there as the rich. There is the same Christ_ the same scripture_ the same Spirit_ the same covenant of promises_ for them both. There is the same heaven for poor saints that there is for rich: Lazarus is in the bosom of Abraham. And there is the same hell for rich sinners that there is for poor. All stand upon the same level before God_ as they do also in the grave. The small and great are there.,20250223
Rich people think themselves happy because they are rich; but it is their mistake: The rich man's wealth is_ in his own conceit_ his strong city_ whereas the worst of evils it is too weak and utterly insufficient to protect them from. It will prove that they are not so safe as they imagine; nay_ their wealth may perhaps expose them. ,20250223
Riches and wealth commonly gain people honour among men. Though it be but an image_ if it be a golden image_ all people_ nations_ and languages_ will fall down and worship it. ,20250223
Riches are called substance_ in conformity to the common form of speaking; otherwise_ to the soul and another world_ they are but shadows_ things that are not_ Prov. xxiii,20250223
Riches are things that are not_ and those that have them only fancy themselves happy; but what is laid up in the promises and in heaven for the righteous will make them truly_ thoroughly_ and eternally happy. ,20250223
Riches will leave us. Those that hold them ever so fast cannot hold them long; either they must be taken from us or we must be taken from them. The goods are said to flow away as a stream (Job xx. here to flee as a bird. ,20250223
Riches will stand men in no stead that day. They will neither put by the stroke nor ease the pain_ much less take out the sting; what profit will this world's birth-rights be of then? In the day of public judgments riches often expose men rather than protect them_ Ezek. vii. 19,20250223
Riches_ wealth_ and honour_ are God's gifts_ the gifts of his providence_ and not given_ as his rain and sunshine_ alike to all_ but to some_ and not to others_ as God sees fit. ,20250223
Righteousness is cleanness; it makes us acceptable to God and easy to ourselves_ Ps. xviii. 24,20250223
Righteousness is the rise and stability even of mean families: Even the tabernacle of the upright_ though movable and despicable as a tent_ shall flourish_ in outward prosperity if Infinite Wisdom see good_ at all events in graces and comfort_ which are true riches and honours.,20250223
Righteousness shall be imputed to him_ and peace thereupon spoken_ the joy and gladness of which he shall then be made to hear though he could not hear them in the day of his affliction. God will now deal with him as a righteous man_ with whom it shall be well. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord_ even righteousness_ Ps.,20250223
Rise up_ and come away. All that have by faith come to Christ must come with Christ_ in holy obedience to him and compliance with him. Being joined to him_ we must walk with him. This is his command to us daily: __Come with me_ my spouse; come with me to God as a Father; come with me onward_ heavenward; come forward with me; come up with me; come with me from Lebanon_ from the top of Amana_ from the lions' dens.__ These mountains are to be considered_ ,20250223

Ruin and destruction are the certain consequences of wickedness. The wicked shall not only not inherit the earth_ though they lay up their treasure in it_ but they shall not so much as inhabit the earth; God's judgments will root them out. Destruction_ swift and sure destruction_ shall be to the workers of iniquity_ destruction from the presence of the Lord and the glory of his power. Nay_ that way of the Lord which is the strength of the upright is consumption and terror to the workers of iniquity; the same gospel which to the one is a savour of life unto life to the other is a savour of death unto death; the same providence_ like the same sun_ softens the one and hardens the other_ Hos. xiv. 9.,20250223

Sacrifices were of divine institution; and when they were offered in faith_ and with repentance and reformation_ God was greatly honoured by them and well-pleased in them. But they were often not only unacceptable_ but an abomination_ to God_ and he declared so_ which was an indication both that they were not required for their own sakes and that there were better things_ and for effectual_ in reserve_ when sacrifice and offering should be done away. They were an abomination_,20250223
Sadness is often a happy means of seriousness_ and that affliction which is impairing to the health_ estate_ and family_ may be improving to the mind_ and make such impressions upon that as may alter its temper very much for the better_ may make it humble and meek_ loose from the world_ penitent for sin_ and careful of duty. Vexatio dat intellectum—Vexation sharpens the intellect. Periissem nisi periissem—I should have perished if I had not been made wretched. It will follow_ on the contrary_ that by the mirth and frolicsomeness of the countenance the heart is made worse_ more vain_ carnal_ sensual_ and secure_ more in love with the world and more estranged from God and spiritual things (Job xxi. 12_ till it become utterly unconcerned in the afflictions of Joseph_ as those Amos vi. 5_ 6_ and the king and Haman_ Esth. iii. 15.,20250223
Saints are wise men_ and act wisely for themselves; for though their religion now wraps them up in obscurity_ and lays them open to reproach_ yet they are sure to inherit glory at last_ the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. They shall have it_ and have it by inheritance_ the sweetest and surest tenure. God gives them grace (v. and therefore they shall inherit glory_ for grace is glory_ 2 Cor. iii,20250223
Saints lay up the best securities for themselves: He that sows righteousness_ that is good_ and makes it his business to do good_ with an eye to a future recompence_ he shall have a sure reward; it is made as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. If the seedness fail not_ the harvest shall not_ Gal. vi. 8.,20250223
Saints secured from ruin. Those that are upright in their way_ that mean honestly in all their actions_ adhere conscientiously to the sacred and eternal rules of equity_ and deal sincerely both with God and man_ their integrity will keep them from the temptations of Satan_ which shall not prevail over them_ the reproaches and injuries of evil men_ which shall not fasten upon them_ to do them any real mischief_ Ps. xxv. 21.,20250223
Salvation (v. 16): He also shall be my salvation. He means it not of temporal salvation (he had little expectation of that); but concerning his eternal salvation he was very confident that God would not only be his Saviour to make him happy_ but his salvation_ in the vision and fruition of whom he should be happy. And the reason why he depended on God for salvation was because a hypocrite shall not come before him. He knew himself not to be a hypocrite_ and that none but hypocrites are rejected of God_ and therefore concluded he should not be rejected. Sincerity is our evangelical perfection; nothing will ruin us but the want of that.,20250223

Satan would have had God put forth his hand and do it; but he afflicts not willingly_ nor takes any pleasure in grieving the children of men_ much less his own children (Lam. iii. and therefore_ if it must be done_ let Satan do it_ who delights in such work: __He is in thy hand_ do thy worst with him; but with a proviso and limitation_ only save his life_ or his soul. Afflict him_ but not to death.__ Satan hunted for the precious life_ would have taken that if he might_ in hopes that dying agonies would force Job to curse his God; but God had mercy in store for Job after this trial_ and therefore he must survive it_ and_ however he is afflicted_ must have his life given him for a prey. If God did not chain up the roaring lion_ how soon would he devour us! As far as he permits the wrath of Satan and wicked men to proceed against his people he will make it turn to his praise and theirs_ and the remainder thereof he will restrain_ Ps. lxxvi,20250223
Satan would no doubt have brought against him now; but no such thing could be alleged_ and therefore_ 3. See how slyly he censured him as a hypocrite_ not asserting that he was so_ but only asking_ __Is he not so?__ This is the common way of slanderers_ whisperers_ backbiters_ to suggest that by way of query which yet they have no reason to think is true. Note_ It is not strange if those that are approved and accepted of God be unjustly censured by the devil and his instruments; if they are otherwise unexceptionable_ it is easy to charge them with hypocrisy_ as Satan charged Job_ and they have no way to clear themselves_ but patiently to wait for the judgment of God. As there is nothing we should dread more than being hypocrites_ so there is nothing we need dread less that being called and counted so without cause,20250223
Satan_ that sworn enemy to God and all good men_ is here pushing forward his malicious prosecution of Job_ whom he hated because God loved him_ and did all he could to separate between him and his God_ to sow discord and make mischief between them_ urging God to afflict him and then urging him to blaspheme God. One would have thought that he had enough of his former attempt upon Job_ in which he was so shamefully baffled and disappointed; but malice is restless: the devil and his instruments are so. Those that calumniate good people_ and accuse them falsely_ will have their saying_ though the evidence to the contrary be ever so plain and full and they have been cast in the issue which they themselves have put it upon. Satan will have Job's cause called over again. The malicious_ unreasonable_ importunity of that great persecutor of the saints is represented (Rev. xii. 10) by his accusing them before our God day and night_ still repeating and urging that against them which has been many a time answered: so did Satan here accuse Job day after day. Here is_,20250223

Scorners that delight in scorning—proud people that take a pleasure in hectoring all about them_ jovial people that banter all mankind_ and make a jest of every thing that comes in their way. But scoffers at religion are especially meant_ the worst of sinners_ that scorn to submit to the truths and laws of Christ_ and to the reproofs and admonitions of his word_ and take a pride in running down every thing that is sacred and serious. ,20250223

Secondly_ He delivers the oppressed_ v,20250223
Secondly_ He shall have a stately monument erected over him. He shall remain in the tomb with a Hic jacet—Here lies_ over him_ and a large encomium. Perhaps it is meant of the embalming of his body to preserve it_ which was a piece of honour anciently done by the Egyptians to their great men. He shall watch in the tomb (so the word is)_ shall abide solitary and quiet there_ as a watchman in his tower. Thirdly_ The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him; there shall be as much done as can be with rich odours to take off the noisomeness of the grave_ as by lamps to set aside the darkness of it_ which perhaps was referred to in the foregoing phrase of watching in the tomb. But it is all a jest; what is the light_ or what the perfume_ to a man that is dead? Fourthly_ It shall be alleged_ for the lessening of the disgrace of death_ that it is the common lot: He has only yielded to fate_ and every man shall draw after him_ as there are innumerable before him. Note_ Death is the way of all the earth: when we are to cross that darksome valley we must consider,20250223
Secondly_ The soul_ that beam of light_ returns to that God who_ when he made man of the dust of the ground_ breathed into him the breath of life_ to make him a living soul (Gen. ii.,20250223

See here 1. What arts men use to get a good bargain and to buy cheap. They not only cheapen carelessly_ as if they had no need_ no mind for the commodity_ when perhaps they cannot go without it (there may be prudence in that)_ but they vilify and run down that which yet they know to be of value; they cry_ __It is naught_ it is naught; it has this and the other fault_ or perhaps may have; it is not good of the sort; and it is too dear; we can have better and cheaper elsewhere_ or have bought better and cheaper.__ This is the common way of dealing; and after all_ it may be_ they know the contrary of what they affirm; but the buyer_ who may think he has no other way of being even with the seller_ does as extravagantly commend his goods and justify the price he sets on them_ and so there is a fault on both sides; whereas the bargain would be made every jot as well if both buyer and seller would be modest and speak as they think,20250223
See here how men often expose themselves by that very thing by which they hope to gain applause. 1. Some take a pride in being quick. They answer a matter before they hear it_ hear it out_ nay_ as soon as they but hear of it. They think it is their honour to take up a cause suddenly; and_ when they have heard one side_ they think the matter so plain that they need not trouble themselves to hear the other; they are already apprized of it_ and masters of all the merits of the cause. Whereas_ though a ready wit is an agreeable thing to play with_ it is solid judgment and sound wisdom that do business,20250223
See here how men's character and condition are measured and judged of by their conduct towards their poor neighbours. 1. Those that look upon them with contempt have here assigned them a bad character_ and their condition will be accordingly: He that despises his neighbour because he is low in the world_ because he is of a mean extraction_ rustic education_ and makes but a mean figure_ that thinks it below him to take notice of him_ converse with him_ or concern himself about him_ and sets him with the dogs of his flock_ is a sinner_ is guilty of a sin_ is in the way to worse_ and shall be dealt with as a sinner; unhappy is he,20250223
See here how much it is our interest_ as well as duty,20250223
See here the character of a very wicked man. 1. The strong inclination he has to do mischief. His very soul desires evil_ desires that evil may be done and that he may have the pleasure_ not only of seeing it_ but of having a hand in it. The root of wickedness lies in the soul; the desire that men have to do evil_ that is the lust which conceives and brings forth sin,20250223
See here the evil of a sluggish slothful disposition. 1. It stupefies men_ and makes them senseless_ and mindless of their own affairs_ as they were cast into a deep sleep_ dreaming much_ but doing nothing. Slothful people doze away their time_ bury their talents_ live a useless life_ and are the unprofitable burdens of the earth; for any service they do when they are awake they might as well be always asleep. Even their souls are idle and lulled asleep_ their rational powers chilled and frozen.,20250223
See here the evil of slothfulness and the love of ease. 1. It keeps men from the most necessary business_ from ploughing and sowing when the season is: The sluggard has ground to occupy_ and has ability for it; he can plough_ but he will not; some excuse or other he has to shift it off_ but the true reason is that it is cold weather. Though ploughing time is not in the depth of winter_ it is in the borders of winter_ when he thinks it too cold for him to be abroad. Those are scandalously sluggish who_ in the way of their business_ cannot find in their hearts to undergo so little toil as that of ploughing and so little hardship as that of a cold blast. Thus careless are many in the affairs of their souls; a trifling difficulty will frighten them from the most important duty; but good soldiers must endure hardness,20250223
See here the mischief of pride and haughtiness. 1. It exposes men to sin; it makes them passionate_ and kindles in them the fire of proud wrath. They are continually dealing in it_ as if it were their trade to be angry_ and they had nothing so much to do as to barter passions and exchange bitter words. Most of the wrath that inflames the spirits and societies of men is proud wrath. Men cannot bear the least slight_ nor in any thing to be crossed or contradicted_ but they are out of humour_ nay_ in a heat_ immediately. It likewise makes them scornful when they are angry_ very abusive with their tongues_ insolent towards those above them and imperious towards all about them. Only by pride comes all this,20250223
See here the mischief that flows from an angry_ passionate_ furious disposition. 1. It makes men provoking to one another: An angry man stirs up strife_ is troublesome and quarrelsome in the family and in the neighbourhood_ blows the coals_ and even forces those to fall out with him that would live peaceable and quietly by him,20250223
See here the noble security of the scripture-style_ which seems to contradict itself_ but really does not. Wise men have need to be directed how to deal with fools; and they have never more need of wisdom than in dealing with such_ to know when to keep silence and when to speak_ for there may be a time for both. 1. In some cases a wise man will not set his wit to that of a fool so far as to answer him according to his folly __If he boast of himself_ do not answer him by boasting of thyself. If he rail and talk passionately_ do not thou rail and talk passionately too. If he tell one great lie_ do not thou tell another to match it. If he calumniate thy friends_ do not thou calumniate his. If he banter_ do not answer him in his own language_ lest thou be like him_ even thou_ who knowest better things_ who hast more sense_ and hast been better taught.__ 2. Yet_ in other cases_ a wise man will use his wisdom for the conviction of a fool_ when_ by taking notice of what he says_ there may be hopes of doing good_ or at least preventing further_ mischief_ either to himself or others. __If thou have reason to think that thy silence will be deemed an evidence of the weakness of thy cause_ or of thy own weakness_ in such a case answer him_ and let it be an answer ad hominem—to the man_ beat him at his own weapons_ and that will be an answer ad rem—to the point_ or as good as one. If he offer any thing that looks like an argument_ an answer that_ and suit thy answer to his case. If he think_ because thou dost not answer him_ that what he says is unanswerable_ then give him an answer_ lest he be wise in his own conceit and boast of a victory.__ For (Luke vii. 35) Wisdom's children must justify her.,20250223
See here what a great difference there is between the condition and temper of some and others of the children of men. 1. Some are much in affliction_ and of a sorrowful spirit_ and all their days are evil days_ like those of old age_ and days of which they say they have no pleasure in them. They eat in darkness (Eccl. v. 17) and never eat with pleasure_ Job xxi,20250223
See here what man is_ and let him be humbled_ v,20250223
See here what sin and ruin those involve themselves in who are drawn away by the enticement of sinners. 1. They incur a great deal of guilt: He does so that goes partner with such as rob and defraud_ and casts in his lot among them_ ch. i. 11_ &c. The receiver is as bad as the thief; and_ being drawn in to join with him in the commission of the sin_ he cannot escape joining with him in the concealment of it_ though it be with the most horrid perjuries and execrations. They hear cursing when they are sworn to tell the whole truth_ but they will not confess,20250223
See here_,20250223
See here_ ,20250223
See him devoured and swallowed up by a miserable death; and miserable indeed a wicked man's death is_ how secure and jovial soever his life was. 1. See him dying_ arrested by the first-born of death (some disease_ or some stroke that has in it a more than ordinary resemblance of death itself; so great a death_ as it is called_ 2 Cor. i. 10_ a messenger of death that has in it an uncommon strength and terror)_ weakened by the harbingers of death_ which devour the strength of his skin_ that is_ it shall bring rottenness into his bones and consume them. His confidence shall then be rooted out of his tabernacle (v. that is_ all that he trusted to for his support shall be taken from him_ and he shall have nothing to rely upon_ no_ not his own tabernacle. His own soul was his confidence_ but that shall be rooted out of the tabernacle of the body_ as a tree that cumbered the ground. __Thy soul shall be required of thee.__ 2. See him dead_ and see his case then with an eye of faith. ,20250223
See his family sunk and cut off_ v,20250223
See how Christ's exposition of the seventh commandment agrees with the ancient sense of it_ and how much better Job understood it than the Pharisees_ though they sat in Moses's chair.,20250223
See how fearless he is_ how he despises death and the most threatening dangers_ (v. 22): He mocks at fear_ and makes a jest of it; slash at him with a sword_ rattle the quiver_ brandish the spear_ to drive him back_ he will not retreat_ but press forward_ and even inspires courage into his rider. ,20250223
See how forward he is to engage: He goes on to meet the armed men_ animated_ not by the goodness of the cause_ or the prospect of honour_ but only by the sound of the trumpet_ the thunder of the captains_ and the shouting of the soldiers_ which are as bellows to the fire of his innate courage_ and make him spring forward with the utmost eagerness_ as if he cried_ Ha! ha! v,20250223
See how frivolous the excuse is which men commonly make for the mischief they do_ that they did it in a jest; with this they think to turn it off when they are reproved for it_ Am not I in sport? But it will prove dangerous playing with fire and jesting with edge-tools. Not that those are to be commended who are captious_ and can take no jest (those that themselves are wise must suffer fools_ 2 Cor. xi. 19_ but those are certainly to be condemned who are any way abusive to their neighbours_ impose upon their credulity_ cheat them in their bargains with them_ tell lies to them or tell lies of them_ give them ill language_ or sully their reputation_ and then think to excuse it by saying that they did but jest. Am not I in sport? He that sins in just must repent in earnest_ or his sin will be his ruin. Truth is too valuable a thing to be sold for a jest_ and so is the reputation of our neighbour. By lying and slandering in jest men learn themselves_ and teach others_ to lie and slander in earnest; and a false report_ raised in mirth_ may be spread in malice; besides_ if a man may tell a lie to make himself merry_ why not to make himself rich_ and so truth quite perishes_ and men teach their tongues to tell lies_ Jer. ix,20250223
See how frolicsome he is (v. 21): He paws in the valley_ scarcely knowing what ground he stands upon. He is proud of his strength_ and he has much more reason to be so as using his strength in the service of man_ and under his direction_ than the wild ass that uses it in contempt of man_ and in a revolt from him v,20250223
See how furious he is. He curvets and prances_ and runs on with so much violence and heat against the enemy that one would think he even swallowed the ground with fierceness and rage_ v,20250223
See how ill affected they are to God and religion; they abandon them_ and cast off the thoughts of them. ,20250223
See how many ways God has of contending with a sinful people and taking from them abused_ forfeited_ mercies; and how utterly unable we are to contend with him. If we might invert the order_ this verse would fitly refer to Noah's flood_ that ever memorable instance of the divine power. God then_ in wrath_ sent the waters out_ and they overturned the earth; but in mercy he withheld them_ shut the windows of heaven and the fountains of the great deep_ and then_ in a little time_ they dried up.,20250223
See how ready God is to answer prayer_ especially prayers for instruction; even while she is yet speaking_ he hears. Observe,20250223
See how they argue against God and religion (v. 15): What is the Almighty? Strange that ever creatures should speak so insolently_ that ever reasonable creatures should speak so absurdly and unreasonably. The two great bonds by which we are drawn and held to religion are those of duty and interest; now they here endeavour to break both these bonds asunder. ,20250223
See in what method we are to expect divine acceptance; we must first be humbled under divine rebukes. After God_ by speaking these words_ had caused grief_ he returned and had compassion_ according to the multitude of his mercies; for he will not contend for ever_ but will debate in measure_ and stay his rough wind in the day of his east wind. Now that Job had humbled himself God exalted him. True penitents shall find favour with God_ and what they have said and done amiss shall no more be mentioned against them. Then God is well pleased with us when we are brought to abhor ourselves. ,20250223
See the cause of it: It is given by the breath of God_ that is_ by the word of his power and the command of his will; or_ as some understand it_ by the wind_ which is the breath of God_ as the thunder is his voice; it is caused by the cold freezing wind out of the north. See the effect of it: The breadth of the waters is straitened_ that is_ the waters that had spread themselves_ and flowed with liberty_ are congealed_ benumbed_ arrested_ bound up in crystal fetters. This is such an instance of the power of God as_ if it were not common_ would be next to a miracle.,20250223
See the folly and madness of a passionate discontent_ and how absurdly and extravagantly it talks when the reins are laid on the neck of it. Is this Job_ who was so much admired for his wisdom that unto him men gave ear_ and kept silence at his counsel_ and after his words they spoke not again? ch. xxix. 21_ 11. Surely his wisdom failed him_ ,20250223
See the mischief they do to the country. They not only rob travellers_ but they make incursions upon their neighbours_ and reap every one his corn in the field (v. that is_ they enter upon other people's ground_ cut their corn_ and carry it away as freely as if it were their own. Even the wicked gather the vintage_ and it is their wickedness; or_ as we read it_ They gather the vintage of the wicked_ and so one wicked man is made a scourge to another. What the wicked got by extortion (which is their way of stealing) these robbers get from them in their way of stealing; thus oftentimes are the spoilers spoiled_ Isa. xxxiii. 1,20250223
See the nature of hypocrisy: it lies in the heart_ which is for the world and the flesh when the outside seems to be for God and religion. Many that are saints in show and saints in word are hypocrites in heart. That spring is corrupt_ and there is an evil treasure there. See the mischievousness of hypocrisy: hypocrites heap up wrath. They are doing that every day which is provoking to God_ and will be reckoned with for it all together in the great day. They treasure up wrath against the day of wrath_ Rom. ii.,20250223
See this phrase_ ch. xxxix,20250223
See this tree fair and flourishing (v. 16) like a green bay-tree (Ps. xxxvii. green before the sun_ it keeps its greenness in defiance of the scorching sun-beams_ and his branch shoots forth under the protection of his garden-wall and with the benefit of his garden-soil. See it fixed_ and taking deep root_ never likely to be overthrown by stormy winds_ for his roots are interwoven with the stones (v. 17); it grows in firm ground_ not_ as the rush_ of mire and water. Thus does a wicked man_ when he prospers in the world_ think himself secure; his wealth is a high wall in his own conceit. ,20250223
See this tree felled and forgotten notwithstanding_ destroyed from his place (v. and so entirely extirpated that there shall remain no sign or token where it grew. The very place say_ I have not seen thee; and the standers by shall say the same. I sought him_ but he could not be found_ Ps. xxxvi,20250223
See what a fool's talk is. 1. It takes rise from his own weakness and wickedness: The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness_ the foolishness bound up in his heart_ that is the corrupt spring out of which all these polluted streams flow_ the evil treasure out of which evil things are brought. As soon as he begins to speak you may perceive his folly; at the very first he talks idly_ and passionately_ and like himself,20250223
See what a great grief it is to a good minister to be silenced and thrust into a corner; he is full of matter_ full of Christ_ full of heaven_ and would speak of these things for the good of others_ but he may not. ,20250223
See what a mercy it is to be under the restraints of an awakened conscience. Faithful are the wounds_ and kind are the bonds_ of that friend_ for by them the soul is kept from perishing eternally.,20250223
See what becomes of the wicked_ who choose the way of the evil man; they shall be cut off_ not only from heaven hereafter and all hopes of that_ but from the earth now_ on which they set their affections_ and in which they lay up their treasure. They think to take root in it_ but they and their families shall be rooted out of it_ in judgment to them_ but in mercy to the earth. There is a day coming which shall leave them neither root nor branch_ Mal. iv. 1. Let that wisdom then enter into our hearts_ and be pleasant to our souls_ which will keep us out of a way that will end thus.,20250223
See what confusion poor Job was now in_ for he contradicted himself: just now he was troubled for God's absence (v. 8_ 9); now he is troubled at his presence. When I consider_ I am afraid of him. What he now felt made him fear worse. There is indeed that which_ if we consider it_ will show that we have cause to be afraid of God—his infinite justice and purity_ compared with our own sinfulness and vileness; but if_ withal_ we consider his grace in a Redeemer_ and our compliance with that grace_ our fears will vanish and we shall see cause to hope in him. See what impressions were made upon him by the wounds of his spirit. 1. He was very fearful (v. 16): The Almighty troubled him_ and so made his heart soft_ that is_ utterly unable to bear any thing_ and afraid of every thing that stirred. There is a gracious softness_ like that of Josiah_ whose heart was tender_ and trembled at the word of God; but this is meant of a grievous softness which apprehends every thing that is present to be pressing and every thing future to be threatening,20250223
See what folly it is to strive against God_ who is thus prepared for battle and war_ and how much it is our interest to make our peace with him and to keep ourselves in his love. God can fight as effectually with snow and hail_ if he please_ as with thunder and lightning or the sword of an angel!,20250223
See what hunger will bring men to: one half of the world does not know how the other half lives; yet those that have abundance ought to think sometimes of those whose fare is very coarse and who are brought to a short allowance of that too. But we must own the righteousness of God_ and not think it strange_ if slothfulness clothe men with rags and the idle soul be made to suffer hunger. This beggarly world is full of the devil's poor,20250223
See what is the care and business of worldly people—to heap up worldly wealth. Much would have more_ until the silver is cankered and the garments are moth-eaten_ Jam. v. 2_ 3. But what comes of it? He shall never be the better for it himself; death will strip him_ death will rob him_ if he be not robbed and stripped sooner_ Luke xii.,20250223
See what poor_ indigent_ depending creatures we are; we cannot do without rain_ nor can we have it when we will. ,20250223
See what reason we have to be thankful to God for the plenty of open vision which we enjoy.,20250223
See what those that get by it that live in the fear of God_ and always make conscience of their duty to him. 1. Safety: They shall not be visited with evil; they may be visited with sickness or other afflictions_ but there shall be no evil in them_ nothing to hurt them_ because nothing to separate them from the love of God_ or hurt to the soul,20250223
See what was the ground of these thoughts.,20250223
Seeing his days are determined_ the number of his months are with thee_ thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass,20250223
Self-loathing is evermore the companion of true repentance. Ezek. vi. 9_ They shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed. We must no only angry at ourselves for the wrong and damage we have by sin done to our own souls_ but must abhor ourselves_ as having by sin made ourselves odious to the pure and holy God_ who cannot endure to look upon iniquity. If sin be truly an abomination to us_ sin in ourselves will especially be so; the nearer it is to us the more loathsome it will be. ,20250223
Sentence is passed against evil works and evil workers by the righteous Judge of heaven and earth_ even against the evil works of princes and great men_ as well as of inferior persons. ,20250223

Several arguments Elihu here uses to persuade Job not only to give him a patient hearing_ but to believe that he designed him a good office_ and to take it kindly_ and be willing to receive the instructions he was now about to give him. Let Job consider,20250223
Severe rebukes sometimes do a great deal of good_ as corrosives contribute to the cure of a wound_ eating out the proud flesh. The rod drives out even that foolishness which was bound up in the heart_ and cleanses away the evil there,20250223
Shall it be reported to him as a meritorious piece of service_ worthy his notice? By no means; let it never be spoken of___ for he fears that the subject has suffered by his undertaking it_ as a fine face is wronged by a bad painter_ and his performance is so far from meriting thanks that it needs pardon. When we have done all we can for God we must acknowledge that we are unprofitable servants and have nothing at all to boast of. He is afraid of saying any more: If a man speak_ if he undertake to plead for God_ much more if he offer to plead against him_ surely he shall be swallowed up. If he speak presumptuously_ God's wrath shall soon consume him; but_ if ever so well_ he will soon lose himself in the mystery and be over powered by the divine lustre. Astonishment will strike him blind and dumb.,20250223
Shall we then undertake to discourse of God's counsels_ which were from eternity_ or to find out the paths to the house thereof_ to solicit for the alteration of them? God glories in it that he forms the light and creates the darkness; and if we must take those as we find them_ take those as they come_ and quarrel with neither_ but make the best of both_ then we must_ in like manner_ accommodate ourselves to the peace and the evil which God likewise created. Isa. xlv. 7,20250223
She addresses herself to her beloved.,20250223
She adds to his reputation in the world (v. 23): Her husband is known in the gates_ known to have a good wife. By his wise counsels_ and prudent management of affairs_ it appears that he has a discreet companion in his bosom_ by conversation with whom he improves himself. By his cheerful countenance and pleasant humour it appears that he has an agreeable wife at home; for many that have not have their tempers strangely soured by it. Nay_ by his appearing clean and neat in his dress_ every thing about him decent and handsome_ yet not gaudy_ one may know he has a good wife at home_ that takes care of his clothes.,20250223
She applies herself to the business that is proper for her. It is not in a scholar's business_ or statesman's business_ or husbandman's business_ that she employs herself_ but in women's business: She seeks wool and flax_ where she may have the best of each at the best hand_ and cheapest; she has a stock of both by her_ and every thing that is necessary to the carrying on both of the woollen and the linen manufacture (v. and with this she does not only set the poor on work_ which is a very good office_ but does herself work_ and work willingly_ with her hands; she works with the counsel or delight of her hands (so the word is); she goes about it cheerfully and dexterously_ lays not only her hand_ but her mind to it_ and goes on in it without weariness in well-doing. She lays her own hands to the spindle_ or spinning-wheel_ and her hands hold the distaff (v. and she does not reckon it either an abridgment of her liberty or a disparagement to her dignity_ or at all inconsistent with her repose. The spindle and the distaff are here mentioned as her honour_ while the ornaments of the daughters of Zion are reckoned up to their reproach_ Isa. ii. 18_ &c. ,20250223
She ascends out of the wilderness_ the dry and barren land_ where there is no way_ where there is no water_ where travellers are still in want and ever at a loss; here a poor soul may long be left to wander_ but shall come up_ at last_ under the conduct of the Comforter.,20250223
She ascribes all she had that was valuable in her to him_ and depends upon the continued influence of his grace to make her more and more acceptable to him_ ver. 15_ 16.,20250223
She begs of her beloved_ whom she raises up by her prayers (ver. that he would by his grace confirm that blessed union with him to which she was admitted_ ver. 6_ 7.,20250223
She begs the presence of her beloved_ in the mean time_ to support and comfort her: __Turn_ my beloved_ turn to me_ come and visit me_ come and relieve me_ be with me always to the end of the age. In the day of my extremity_ make haste to help me_ make no long tarrying. Come over even the mountains of division_ interposing time and days_ with some gracious anticipations of that light and love.__ 3. She begs that he would not only turn to her for the present_ but hasten his coming to fetch her to himself. __Even so_ come_ Lord Jesus_ come quickly. Though there be mountains in the way_ thou canst_ like a roe_ or a young hart_ step over them with ease. O show thyself to me_ or take me up to thee.__,20250223
She brings in provisions of all things necessary and convenient for her family_ v,20250223
She called the garden his_ and the pleasant fruits of it his_ and he acknowledges them to be so: It is my garden_ it is my spice. When God was displeased with Israel he turned them off to Moses (They are thy people_ Exod. xxxii. 7); and he called the appointed feasts of the Lord their appointed feasts (Isa. i. 14); but now that they are in his favour he owns them for his garden. __Though of small account_ yet it is mine.__ Those that are in sincerity give up themselves and all they have and can do to Jesus Christ_ he will do them the honour to stamp them_ and what they have and do for him_ with his own mark_ and say_ It is mine,20250223
She calls it his garden; for those that are espoused to Christ call nothing their own_ but what they have devoted to him and desire to be used for him. When the spices flow forth then it is fit to be called his garden_ and not till then. The fruits of the garden are his pleasant fruits_ for he planted them_ watered them_ and gave the increase. What can we pretend to merit at Christ's hands when we can invite him to nothing but what is his own already?,20250223
She charges the daughters of Jerusalem not to interrupt her communion with her beloved (ver. 4); and they_ thereupon_ admire her dependence on him_ ver. 5.,20250223
She charges those about her to take heed of doing any thing to interrupt the pleasing communion she now had with her beloved (v. as she had done before_ when he thus strengthened and comforted her with his presence (ch. ii. 7): Let me charge you_ O you daughters of Jerusalem_ and reason with you_ Why should you stir up_ and why should you awake_ my love_ until he will? The church_ our common mother_ charges all her children that they never do any thing to provoke Christ to withdraw_ which we are very prone to do. Why should you put such an affront upon him? Why should you be such enemies to yourselves? We should thus reason with ourselves when we are tempted to do that which will grieve the Spirit. __What! Am I weary of Christ's presence_ that I affront him and provoke him to depart from me? Why should I do that which he will take so unkindly and which I shall certainly repent of?__,20250223
She comes up like pillars of smoke_ like a cloud of incense ascending from the altar or the smoke of the burnt-offerings. This intimates a fire of pious and devout affections in the soul_ whence this smoke arises_ and the mounting of the soul heaven-ward in this smoke (as Judges xiii. the heart lifted up to God in the heavens_ as the sparks fly upward. Christ's return to the soul gives life to its devotion_ and its communion with God is most reviving when it ascends out of a wilderness.,20250223
She conducts herself so that he may repose an entire confidence in her. He trusts in her chastity_ which she never gave him the least occasion to suspect or to entertain any jealousy of; she is not morose and reserved_ but modest and grave_ and has all the marks of virtue in her countenance and behaviour; her husband knows it_ and therefore his heart doth safely trust in her; he is easy_ and makes her so. He trusts in her conduct_ that she will speak in all companies_ and act in all affairs_ with prudence and discretion_ so as not to occasion him either damage or reproach. He trusts in her fidelity to his interests_ and that she will never betray his counsels nor have any interest separate from that of his family. When he goes abroad_ to attend the concerns of the public_ he can confide in her to order all his affairs at home_ as well as if he himself were there. She is a good wife that is fit to be trusted_ and he is a good husband that will leave it to such a wife to manage for him. ,20250223
She contributes so much to his content and satisfaction that he shall have no need of spoil; he needs not be griping and scraping abroad_ as those must be whose wives are proud and wasteful at home. She manages his affairs so that he is always before-hand_ has such plenty of his own that he is in no temptation to prey upon his neighbours. He thinks himself so happy in her that he envies not those who have most of the wealth of this world; he needs it not_ he has enough_ having such a wife. Happy the couple that have such a satisfaction as this in each other! ,20250223
She desired him to eat his pleasant fruits_ to accept of the sacrifices offered in his temple_ which were as the fruits of his garden_ and he does so_ but finds they are not gathered and ready for eating_ therefore he does himself gather them. As the fruits are his_ so is the preparation of them; he finds his heart unready for his entertainment_ but does himself draw out into exercise those gracious habits which he had planted there. What little good there is in us would be shed and lost if he did not gather it_ and preserve it to himself,20250223
She desires his speedy return to her (v. 14): Make haste_ my beloved_ to come again_ and receive me to thyself; be thou like a roe_ or a young hart_ upon the mountains of spices; let no time be lost; it is pleasant dwelling here in the gardens_ but to depart_ and be with thee_ is far better; that therefore is what I wish_ and wait_ and long for. Even so_ come_ Lord Jesus_ come quickly. Observe,20250223
She desires to be better acquainted with the state of her own soul and the present posture of its affairs (v. 12): Let us see if the vine flourish. Our own souls are our vineyards; they are_ or should be_ planted with vines and pomegranates_ choice and useful trees. We are made keepers of these vineyards_ and therefore are concerned often to look into them_ to examine the state of our own souls_ to seek whether the vine flourishes_ whether our graces be in act and exercise_ whether we be fruitful in the fruits of righteousness_ and whether our fruit abound. And especially let us enquire whether the tender grape appear and whether the pomegranates bud forth_ what good motions and dispositions there are in us that are yet but young and tender_ that they may be protected and cherished with a particular care_ and may not be nipped_ or blasted_ or rubbed off_ but cultivated_ that they may bring forth fruit unto perfection. In this enquiry into our own spiritual state_ it will be good to take Christ along with us_ because his presence will make the vine flourish and the tender grape appear_ as the returning sun revives the gardens_ and because to him we are concerned to approve ourselves. If he sees the vine flourish_ and the tender grape appear—if we can appeal to him_ Thou knowest all things_ thou knowest that I love thee_—if his Spirit witness with our spirit that our souls prosper_ it is enough. And_ if we would be acquainted with ourselves_ we must beg of him to search and try us_ to help us in the search_ and discover us to ourselves.,20250223
She desires to go forth into the fields and villages to have this communion with him. Those that would converse with Christ must go forth from the world and the amusements of it_ must avoid every thing that would divert the mind and be a hindrance to it when it should be wholly taken up with Christ; we must contrive how to attend upon the Lord without distraction (1 Cor. vii. for therefore the spouse here covets to get out of the noise of the town. Let us go forth to him without the camp_ Heb. xiv,20250223
She did not go to bed again_ but went in pursuit of him: I sought him; I called him. She might have saved herself this labour if she would but have bestirred herself when he first called; but we cut ourselves out a great deal of work_ and create ourselves a great deal of trouble_ by our own slothfulness and carelessness in improving our opportunities. Yet it is her praise that_ when her beloved has withdrawn_ she continues seeking him; her desires toward him are made more strong_ and her enquiries after him more solicitous_ by his withdrawings. She calls him by prayer_ calls after him_ and begs of him to return; and she not only prays but uses means_ she seeks him in the ways wherein she used to find him. ,20250223
She does what she does with all her might_ and does not trifle in it (v. 17); She girds her loins with strength and strengthens her arms; she does not employ herself in sitting work only_ or in that which is only the nice performance of the fingers (there are works that are scarcely one remove from doing nothing); but_ if there be occasion_ she will go through with work that requires all the strength she has_ which she will use as one that knows it is the way to have more.,20250223
She doubts not but to experience his tender care of her and affection to her (v. that she should be supported by his power and kept from fainting in the hardest services and sufferings (His left hand shall be under my head) and that she should be comforted with his love—His right hand should embrace me. Thus Christ laid his right hand upon John when he was ready to die away_ Rev. i,20250223
She failed in her endeavour. Sometimes he is found of those that seek him not (Isa. lxv. 1)_ but here he is not found of one that sought him_ either for punishment of her corruptions_ her slothfulness and security (we miss of comfort because we do not seek it aright)_ or for the exercises of grace_ her faith and patience_ to try whether she will continue seeking. The woman of Canaan sought Christ_ and found him not at first_ that she might find him_ at length_ so much the more to her honour and comfort.,20250223
She fell under the displeasure of those of her own house: My mother's children were angry with me. She was in perils by false brethren; her foes were those of her own house (Matt. x. brethren by nature as men_ by profession as members of the same sacred corporation_ the children of the church her mother_ but not of God her Father; they were angry with her. The Samaritans_ who claimed kindred to the Jews_ were vexed at any thing that tended to the prosperity of Jerusalem_ Neh. ii,20250223
She found it there when she applied her hand to the lock_ to shoot it back; he that put in his hand by the hole of the door left it there as an evidence that he had been there. When Christ has wrought powerfully upon a soul he leaves a blessed sweetness in it_ which is very delightful to it. With this he oiled the lock_ to make it go easy. Note_ When we apply ourselves to our duty_ in the lively exercises of faith_ under the influence of divine grace_ we shall find it will go on much more readily and sweetly than we expected. If we will but rise up_ to open to Christ_ we shall find the difficulty we apprehended in it strangely overcome_ and shall say with Daniel_ Now let my Lord speak_ for thou hast strengthened me_ Dan.,20250223
She furnishes her house well and has good clothing for herself and her family (v. 22): She makes herself coverings of tapestry to hang her rooms_ and she may be allowed to use them when they are of her own making. Her own clothing is rich and fine: it is silk and purple_ according to her place and rank. Though she is not so vain as to spend much time in dressing herself_ nor makes the putting on of apparel her adorning_ nor values herself upon it_ yet she has rich clothes and puts them on well. The senator's robes which her husband wears are of her own spinning_ and they look better and wear better than any that are bought. She also gets good warm clothing for her children_ and her servants' liveries. She needs not fear the cold of the most pinching winter_ for she and her family are well provided with clothes_ sufficient to keep out cold_ which is the end chiefly to be aimed at in clothing: All her household are clothed in scarlet_ strong cloth and fit for winter_ and yet rich and making a good appearance. They are all double clothed (so some read it)_ have change of raiment_ a winter suit and a summer suit. ,20250223
She gives them this charge by the roes and the hinds of the field_ that is_ by every thing that is amiable in their eyes_ and dear to them_ as the loving hind and the pleasant roe. __My love is to me dearer than those can be to you_ and will be disturbed_ like them_ with a very little noise.__ Note,20250223
She had made trial of secret worship_ and had gone through the duties of the closet_ had remembered him on her bed and meditated on him in the night-watches (Ps. lxiii. but she did not meet with comfort. My sore ran in the night_ and then,20250223
She had occasion to repeat it_ for she had acted unkindly to her beloved_ and_ for her so doing_ he had justly withdrawn himself from her_ and therefore there was occasion to take fresh hold of the covenant_ which continues firm between Christ and believes_ notwithstanding their failings and his frowns_ Ps. lxxxix. 30-35. __I have been careless and wanting in my duty_ and yet I am my beloved's;__ for every transgression in the covenant does not throw us out of covenant. __He has justly hidden his face from me and denied me his comforts_ and yet my beloved is mine;__ for rebukes and chastenings are not only consistent with_ but they flow from covenant-love. ,20250223
She hates to sit still and do nothing: She eats not the bread of idleness_ v,20250223
She herself cries upon the highest places of the city_ as one earnestly desirous of the welfare of the children of men_ and grieved to see them rejecting their own mercies for lying vanities. Our Lord Jesus was himself the publisher of his own gospel; when he had sent forth his disciples he followed them to confirm what they said; nay_ it began to be spoken by the Lord_ Heb. ii,20250223
She humbly and earnestly desires communion with him (v. 11_ 12): __Come_ my beloved_ let us take a walk together_ that I may receive counsel_ instruction_ and comfort from thee_ and may make known my wants and grievances to thee_ with freedom_ and without interruption.__ Thus Christ can walk with the two disciples that were going to the village called Emmaus_ and talked with them_ till he made their hearts burn within them. Observe here,20250223
She implores the influences of the blessed Spirit to make this garden fragrant (v. 16): Awake_ O north wind! and come_ thou south. This is a prayer,20250223
She invited him to come into his garden_ and he says_ I have come. Isa. lviii. 9_ Thou shalt cry_ and he shall say_ Here I am. When Solomon prayed that God would come and take possession of the house he had built for him_ he did come; his glory filled the house (2 Chron. vii. and (v. 16) he let him know that he had chosen and sanctified this house_ that his name might be there for ever. Those that throw open the door of their souls to Jesus Christ shall find him ready to come in to them; and in every place where he records his name he will meet his people_ and bless them_ Exod. xx. 24,20250223
She invites Christ to the best entertainment the garden affords: __Let my beloved then come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruits; let him have the honour of all the products of the garden (it is fit he should)_ and let me have the comfort of his acceptance of them_ for that is the best account they can be made to turn to.__ Observe,20250223
She is as intent upon giving as she is upon getting; she often serves the poor with her own hand_ and she does if freely_ cheerfully_ and very liberally_ with an out-stretched hand. Nor does she relieve her poor neighbours only_ and those that are nigh at hand_ but she reaches forth her hands to the needy that are at a distance_ seeking opportunities to do good and to communicate_ which is as good housewifery as any thing she does.,20250223
She is careful to fill up time_ that none of that be lost. When day-light is done_ she does not then think it time to lay by her work_ as those are forced to do whose business lies abroad in the fields (Ps. civ. but her business lying within-doors_ and her work worth candle-light_ with that she lengthens out the day; and her candle goes not out by night_ v,20250223
She is invited to return_ and the invitation most earnestly pressed: Return_ return; and again_ __Return_ return; recover the peace thou hast lost and forfeited; come back to thy former composedness and cheerfulness of spirit.__ Note_ Good Christians_ after they have had their comfort disturbed_ are sometimes hard to be pacified_ and need to be earnestly persuaded to return again to their rest. As revolting sinners have need to be called to again and again (Turn you_ turn you_ why will you die?) so disquieted saints have need to be called to again and again_ Turn you_ turn you_ why will you droop; Why art thou cast down_ O my soul? 3. Having returned_ she is desired to show her face: That we may look upon thee. Go no longer with they face covered like a mourner. Let those that have made their peace with God lift up their faces without spot (Job xxii.,20250223
She is perfumed with myrrh and frankincense. She is replenished with the graces of God's Spirit_ which are as sweet spices_ or as the holy incense_ which_ being now kindled by his gracious returns_ sends forth a very fragrant smell. Her devotions being now peculiarly lively_ she is not only acceptable to God_ but amiable in the eyes of others also_ who are ready to cry out with admiration_ Who is this? What a monument of mercy is this! The graces and comforts with which she is perfumed are called the powders of the merchant_ for they are far-fetched and dear-bought_ by our Lord Jesus_ that blessed merchant_ who took a long voyage_ and was at vast expense_ no less than that of his own blood_ to purchase them for us. They are not the products of our own soil_ nor the growth of our own country; no_ they are imported from the heavenly Canaan_ the better country.,20250223
She is very willing to trust him with her little sister_ for she herself had had great experience of his grace_ and_ for her part_ she owed her all to him: I am a wall_ and my breasts like towers. This she speaks_ not as upbraiding her little sister that had no breasts_ but comforting her concerning her_ that he who had made her what she was_ who had built her up upon himself and made her to grow up to maturity_ could and would do the same kindness for those whose case she bore upon her heart. Then was I in his eyes as one that found favour. See_ ,20250223
She is willing to rise betimes_ to go along with her beloved: Let us get up early to the vineyards. It intimates her care to improve opportunities of conversing with her beloved; when the time appointed has come_ we must lose no time_ but_ as the woman (Mark xvi. go very early_ though it be to a sepulchre_ if we be in hopes to meet him there. Those that will go abroad with Christ must begin betimes with him_ early in the morning of their days_ must begin every day with him_ seek him early_ seek him diligently,20250223
She lays up for hereafter: She shall rejoice in time to come_ having laid in a good stock for her family_ and having good portions for her children. Those that take pains when they are in their prime will have the pleasure and joy of it when they are old_ both in reflecting upon it and in reaping the benefit of it.,20250223
She leaves it to her own works to praise her_ and does not court the applause of men. Those are none of the truly virtuous women that love to hear themselves commended. ,20250223
She makes intercession for others also_ that care might be taken of them (ver. 8_ and pleases herself with the thoughts of her own interest in Christ and his affection to her_ ver. 10.,20250223
She makes it her constant business to do him good_ and is afraid of doing any thing_ even through inadvertency_ that may turn to his prejudice_,20250223
She now remembers the words he said to her when he called her_ and what impressions they made upon her_ reproaching herself for her folly in not complying sooner with her convictions: __My soul failed when he spoke; his words melted me when he said_ My head is wet with dew; and yet_ wretch that I was_ I lay still_ and made excuses_ and did not open to him.__ The smothering and stifling of our convictions is a thing that will be very bitter in the reflection_ when God opens our eyes. Sometimes the word has not its effect immediately upon the heart_ but it melts it afterwards_ upon second thoughts. My soul now melted because of his words which he had spoken before. ,20250223
She only desired him to eat the fruits of the garden_ but he brought along with him something more_ honey_ and wine_ and milk_ which yield substantial nourishment_ and which were the products of Canaan_ Immanuel's land. Christ delights himself greatly in that which he has both conferred upon his people and wrought in them. Or we may suppose this to have been prepared by the spouse herself_ as Esther prepared for the king her husband a banquet of wine; it is but plain fare_ and what is natural_ honey and milk_ but_ being kindly designed_ it is kindly accepted; imperfections are overlooked; the honey-comb is eaten with the honey_ and the weakness of the flesh passed by and pardoned_ because the spirit is willing. When Christ appeared to his disciples after his resurrection he did eat with them a piece of a honey-comb (Luke xxiv. 42_ in which this scripture was fulfilled. He did not drink the wine only_ which is liquor for men_ for great men_ but the milk too_ which is liquor for children_ little children_ for he was to be the holy child Jesus_ that had need of milk,20250223
She only invited him to come himself_ but he_ bringing his own entertainment along with him_ brings his friends too_ and invites them to share in the provisions. The more the merrier_ we say; and here_ where there was so great a plenty_ there was not the worse fare. When our Lord Jesus fed 5000 at once they did all eat and were filled. Christ invites all his friends to the wine and milk which he himself drinks of (Isa. lv. 1)_ to the feast of fat things and wines on the lees_ Isa. xxv,20250223
She owns herself his tenant for a vineyard she held of him at Baal-hamon_ ver. 11_ 12.,20250223
She owns herself obliged to Jesus Christ for all the benefit and comfort she had in communion with him (v. 4): __I sat down under the apple-tree_ glad to be there_ but he admitted me_ nay_ he pressed me_ to a more intimate communion with him: Come in_ thou blessed of the Lord_ why standest thou without? He brought me to the house of wine_ the place where he entertains his special friends_ from lower to higher measures and degrees of comfort_ from the fruit of the apple tree to the more generous fruit of the vine.__ To him that values the divine joys he has more shall be given. One of the rabbin by the banqueting-house understands the tabernacle of the congregation_ where the interpretation of the law was given; surely we may apply it to Christian assemblies_ where the gospel is preached and gospel-ordinances are administered_ particularly the Lord's supper_ that banquet of wine_ especially to the inside of those ordinances_ communion with God in them. Observe,20250223
She passed from the watchmen as soon as she perceived they could give her no tidings of her beloved; she would not stay with them_ because he was not among them_ but went on seeking_ for (as Ainsworth observes) the society neither of brethren_ nor of the church_ nor of ministers_ can comfort the afflicted conscience unless Christ himself be apprehended by faith. But soon after she parted from the watchmen she found him whom she sought_ and then called him him whom my soul loveth_ with as much delight as before with desire. Note_ Those that continue seeking Christ shall find him at last_ and when perhaps they were almost ready to despair of finding him. See Ps. xlii. 7_ 8; lxxvii. 9_ 10; Isa. liv. 7_ 8. Disappointments must not drive us away from gracious pursuits. Hold out_ faith and patience; the vision is for an appointed time_ and_ though the watchman can give us no account of it_ at the end it shall itself speak and not lie; and the comfort that comes in after long waiting_ in the use of means_ will be so much the sweeter at last.,20250223
She pleases herself with the glimpses she has of him_ and the glances she has of his favour: __He stands behind our wall; I know he is there_ for sometimes he looks forth at the window_ or looks in at it_ and displays himself through the lattice.__ Such was the state of the Old-Testament church while it was in expectation of the coming of the Messiah. The ceremonial law is called a wall of partition (Eph. ii. a veil (2 Cor. iii. 13); but Christ stood behind that wall. They had him near them; they had him with them_ though they could not see him clearly. He that was the substance was not far off from the shadows_ Col. ii,20250223
She pretends to have a very great affection for him above any man: __Therefore_ because I have a good supper upon the table_ I came forth to meet thee_ for no friend in the world shall be so welcome to it as thou shalt_ v,20250223
She promises herself then the satisfaction of making a more open profession of her relation to him than at present she could make: __When I should find thee without_ any where_ even before company_ I would kiss thee_ as a sister does her own brother_ especially her little brother that is now sucking the breasts of her mother__ (for so some understand it); __I would use all the decent freedom with thee that could be_ and should not be despised for it_ as doing any thing unbecoming the modesty of my sex.__ The church_ since Christ's incarnation_ can better own him than she could before_ when she would have been laughed at for being so much in love with one that was not yet born. Christ has become as our brother; wherever we find him_ therefore_ let us be ready to own our relation to him and affection for him_ and not fear being despised for it_ nor regard that any more than David did when he danced before the ark. If this be to be vile_ I will be yet more vile. Nay_ let us hope that we shall not be despised so much as some imagine. Of the maid-servants of whom thou hast spoken I shall be had in honour. Wherever we find the image of Christ_ though it be without_ among those that do not follow him with us_ we must love it_ and testify that love_ and we shall not be despised for it_ but catholic charity will gain us respect,20250223
She promises him to bid him welcome to the best she had; she would cause him to drink of her spiced wine and the juice of her pomegranate_ and bid him welcome to it_ wishing it better for his sake. The exercise of grace and the performance of duty are spiced wine to the Lord Jesus_ very acceptable to him_ as expressive of a grateful sense of his favours. Those that are pleased with Christ must study to be pleasing to him; and they will not find him hard to be pleased. He reckons hearty welcome his best entertainment; and_ if he have that_ he will bring his entertainment along with him,20250223
She promises to improve the opportunity she should then have for cultivating an acquaintance with him (v. 2): __I would lead thee_ as my brother_ by the arm_ and hang upon thee; I would show thee all the house of my precious things_ would bring thee into my mother's house_ into the church_ into the solemn assemblies (ch. iii. into my closet__ (for there the saints have most familiar communion with Christ)_ __and there thou wouldst instruct me__ (so some read it)_ as brethren inform their sisters of what they desire to be instructed in. Those that know Christ shall be taught of him; and therefore we should desire communion with Christ that we may receive instruction from him. He has come that he might give us an understanding. Or_ __My mother would instruct me when I have thee with me.__ It is the presence of Christ in and with his church that makes the word and ordinances instructive to her children_ who shall all be taught of God,20250223
She purchases lands_ and enlarges the demesne of the family (v. 16): She considers a field_ and buys it. She considers what an advantage it will be to the family and what a good account it will turn to_ and therefore she buys it; or_ rather_ though she have ever so much mind to it she will not buy it till she has first considered it_ whether it be worth her money_ whether she can afford to take so much money out of her stock as must go to purchase it_ whether the title be good_ whether the ground will answer the character given of it_ and whether she has money at command to pay for it. Many have undone themselves by buying without considering; but those who would make advantageous purchases must consider_ and then buy. She also plants a vineyard_ but it is with the fruit of her hands; she does not take up money_ or run into debt_ to do it_ but she does it with what she can spare out of the gains of her own housewifery. Men should not lay out any thing upon superfluities_ till_ by the blessing of God upon their industry_ they have got before-hand_ and can afford it; and then the fruit of the vineyard is likely to be doubly sweet_ when it is the fruit of honest industry. ,20250223
She remembers the abundant comfort she has had in communion with him: She sat down by him with great delight_ as shepherds sometimes repose themselves_ sometimes converse with one another_ under a tree. A double advantage she found in sitting down so near the Lord Jesus:—1. A refreshing shade: I sat down under his shadow_ to be sheltered by him from the scorching heat of the sun_ to be cooled_ and so to take some rest. Christ is to believers as the shadow of a great tree_ nay_ of a great rock in a weary land_ Isa. xxxii. 2; xxv,20250223
She repeats the gracious invitation he had given her to come a walking with him_ v. 10-13. She remembers what her beloved said to her_ for it had made a very pleasing and powerful impression upon her_ and the word that quickens us we shall never forget. She relates it for the encouragement of others_ telling them what he had said to her soul and done for her soul_ Ps. lxvi. 16.,20250223
She rises early_ while it is yet night (v. to give her servants their breakfast_ that they may be ready to go cheerfully about their work as soon as the day breaks. She is none of those who sit up playing at cards_ or dancing_ till midnight_ till morning_ and then lie in bed till noon. No; the virtuous woman loves her business better than her ease or her pleasure_ is in care to be found in the way of her duty every hour of the day_ and has more true satisfaction in having given meat to her household betimes in the morning than those can have in the money they have won_ much more in what they have lost_ who sat up all night at play. Those that have a family to take care of should not love their bed too well in a morning. ,20250223
She still calls him her beloved_ being resolved_ how cloudy and dark soever the day be_ she will not quit her relation to him and interest in him. It is a weakness_ upon every apprehension either of our own failings or of God's withdrawings_ to conclude hardly as to our spiritual state. Every desertion is not despair. I will say_ Lord_ I believe_ though I must say_ Lord_ help my unbelief. Though he leave me_ I love him; he is mine. ,20250223
She therefore endeavors to remove this offence; she owns she is black. Guilt blackens; the heresies_ scandals_ and offences_ that happen in the church_ make her black; and the best saints have their failings. Sorrow blackens; that seems to be especially meant; the church is often in a low condition_ mean_ and poor_ and in appearance despicable_ her beauty sullied and her face foul with weeping; she is in mourning weeds_ clothed with sackcloth_ as the Nazarites that had become blacker than a coal_ Lam. iv,20250223
She trades abroad. She makes more than she and her household have occasion for; and therefore_ when she has sufficiently stocked her family_ she sells fine linen and girdles to the merchants (v. who carry them to Tyre_ the mart of the nations_ or some other trading city. Those families are likely to thrive that sell more than they buy; as it is well with the kingdom when abundance of its home manufactures are exported. It is no disgrace to those of the best quality to sell what they can spare_ nor to deal in trade and send ventures by sea. ,20250223
She was espoused to him_ and that made her beautiful. Uxor fulget radiis mariti—The spouse shines in her husband's rays. It it repeated_ Thou art fair_ and again_ Thou art fair_ denoting not only the certainty of it_ but the pleasure he took in speaking of it.,20250223
She was ill-treated by the watchmen; They found me; they smote me; they wounded me_ v,20250223
She will be content to take up her lodging in the villages_ the huts or cottages which the country people built for their shelter when they attended their business in the fields; there_ in these mean and cold dwellings_ she will gladly reside_ if she may but have her beloved with her. His presence will make them fine and pleasant_ and convert them into palaces. A gracious soul can reconcile itself to the poorest accommodations_ if it may have communion with God in them,20250223
She would have it thought that Providence itself countenanced her choice of him for her companion; for how quickly had she found him whom she sought!,20250223
Short_ ver. 1,20250223
Should God suffer that roaring lion to have his will against any of us_ how miserable would he soon make us!,20250223
Should not his dread fall upon you_ and give a check to your passions?__ Methinks Job speaks this as one that did himself know the terror of the Lord_ and lived in a holy fear of him_ whatever his friends suggested to the contrary. Note_ ,20250223
Shouldst thou_ displeased_ give me a frowning look_,20250223
Shows the vanity of those things in which men commonly look for happiness_ as human learning and policy_ sensual delight_ honour and power_ riches and great possessions. And then_ 2. He prescribes remedies against the vexation of spirit that attends them. Though we cannot cure them of their vanity_ we may prevent the trouble they give us_ by sitting loose to them_ enjoying them comfortable_ but laying our expectations low from them_ and acquiescing in the will of God concerning us in every event_ especially by remembering God in the days of our youth_ and continuing in his fear and service all our days_ with an eye to the judgment to come.,20250223
Si vis amari_ ama—,20250223
Silver and gold are precious things with them_ and they have them in their eye in all these pursuits. They fancy they see them glittering before their faces_ and_ in the prospect of laying hold of them_ they make nothing of all these difficulties; for they make something of their toil at last: That which is hidden bringeth he forth to light_ v,20250223
Simple ones that love simplicity. Sin is simplicity_ and sinners are simple ones; they do foolishly_ very foolishly; and the condition of those is very bad who love simplicity_ are fond of their simple notions of good and evil_ their simple prejudices against the ways of God_ and are in their element when they are doing a simple thing_ sporting themselves in their own deceivings and flattering themselves in their wickedness. ,20250223
Sin exceedingly sinful: It is as laughter to a fool to do mischief; it is as natural to him_ and as pleasant_ as it is to a man to laugh. Wickedness is his Isaac (that is the word here); it is his delight_ his darling_ and that in which he pleases himself. He makes a laughing matter of sin. When he is warned not to sin_ from the consideration of the law of God and the revelation of his wrath against sin_ he makes a jest of the admonition_ and laughs at the shaking of the spear; when he has sinned_ instead of sorrowing for it_ he boasts of it_ ridicules reproofs_ and laughs away the convictions of his own conscience_ ch. xiv. 9,20250223
Sin is insatiable: The eyes of man are never satisfied_ nor the appetites of the carnal mind towards profit or pleasure. The eye is not satisfied with seeing_ nor is he the loves silver satisfied with silver. Men labour for that which surfeits_ but satisfies not; nay_ it is dissatisfying; but satisfies not; nay_ it is dissatisfying; such a perpetual uneasiness have men justly been doomed to ever since our first parents were not satisfied with all the trees of Eden_ but they must meddle with the forbidden tree. Those whose eyes are ever toward the Lord in him are satisfied_ and shall for ever be so.,20250223
Sin is the ruin of great families: The house of the wicked_ though built ever so strong and high_ shall be overthrown_ shall be brought to poverty and disgrace_ and at length be extinct. His hope for heaven_ the house on which he leans_ shall not stand_ but fail in the storm; the deluge that comes will sweep it away,20250223
Sin is the shame of sinners: The simple_ who love simplicity_ get nothing by it; they inherit folly. They have it by inheritance_ so some. This corruption of nature is derived from our first parents_ and all the calamities that attend it we have by kind; it was the inheritance they transmitted to their degenerate race_ an hereditary disease. They are as fond of it as a man of his inheritance_ hold it as fast_ and are as loth to part with it. What they value themselves upon is really foolish; and what will be the issue of their simplicity but folly? They will for ever rue their own foolish choice,20250223
Sin may possibly be pleasant in the commission: Bread of deceit_ wealth gotten by fraud_ by lying and oppression_ may be sweet to a man_ and the more sweet for its being ill-gotten_ such pleasure does the carnal mind take in the success of its wicked projects. All the pleasures and profits of sin are bread of deceit. They are stolen_ for they are forbidden fruit; and they will deceive men_ for they are not what they promise. For a time_ however_ they are rolled under the tongue as a sweet morsel_ and the sinner blesses himself in them. But_ 2. It will be bitter in reflection. Afterwards the sinner's mouth shall be filled with gravel. When his conscience is awakened_ when he sees himself cheated_ and becomes apprehensive of the wrath of God against him for his sin_ how painful and uneasy then is the thought of it! The pleasures of sin are but for a season_ and are succeeded with sorrow. Some nations have punished malefactors by mingling gravel with their bread.,20250223
Sin_ under the character of a foolish woman_ courts us to accept of her entertainment_ and (ver. 13-16) pretends it is very charming_ ver,20250223
Since the knowledge of the creature would not satisfy_ he would see what the liberal use of it would do: I sought in my heart to give myself unto wine_ that is_ to good meat and good drink. Many give themselves to these without consulting their hearts at all_ not looking any further than merely the gratification of the sensual appetite; but Solomon applied himself to it rationally_ and as a man_ critically_ and only to make an experiment. Observe,20250223
Sinful_ ver,20250223
Sinners are certainly miserable if they do but eat the fruit of their own way. Secondly_ Those that perish must thank themselves_ and can lay no blame upon any other. It is their own device; let them make their boast of it. God chooses their delusions_ Isa. lxvi,20250223
Sinners are fools_ for they are not only preparing disgrace for themselves_ but at the same time flattering themselves with a prospect of honour_ as if they only took the way to be great. Their end will manifest their folly: Shame shall be their promotion. And it will be so much the more their punishment as it will come instead of their promotion; it will be all the promotion they must ever expect_ that God will be glorified in their everlasting confusion.,20250223
Sinners are hated of God_ but saints are beloved_ v,20250223
Sinners herein deceive themselves_ for_ though the sentence be not executed speedily_ it will be executed the more severely at last. Vengeance comes slowly_ but it comes surely_ and wrath is in the mean time treasured up against the day of wrath.,20250223
Sinners put a most fatal cheat upon themselves: The wicked works a deceitful work_ builds himself a house upon the sand_ which will deceive him when the storm comes_ promises himself that by his sin which he will never gain; nay_ it is cutting his throat when it smiles upon him. Sin deceived me_ and by it slew me,20250223
Sion's mourners are the sealed ones_ marked for safety_ Ezek. ix,20250223

Sit under the direction of good ministers: __Feed thyself and thy kids besides the tents of the under-shepherds. Bring thy charge with thee__ (it is probable that the custom was to commit the lambs and kids to the custody of the women_ the shepherdesses); __they shall all be welcome; the shepherds will be no hindrance to thee_ as they were to Reuel's daughters (Exod. ii. but helpers rather_ and therefore abide by their tents.__ Note_ Those that would have acquaintance and communion with Christ must closely and conscientiously adhere to holy ordinances_ must join themselves to his people and attend his ministers. Those that have the charge of families must bring them with them to religious assemblies; let their kids_ their children_ their servants_ have the benefit of the shepherds' tents.,20250223
Slothfulness Reproved.,20250223
So backward we are to works of charity_ and so ready to think that giving undoes us_ that we need to have it very much pressed upon us how much it is for our own advantage to do good to others_ as before_ v,20250223
So does a carnal worldling hug himself in the fulness and firmness of his outward prosperity; he prides himself in that house as his palace_ fortifies himself in it as his castle_ and makes use of it as the spider of her web_ to ensnare those he has a mind to prey upon. So does a formal professor; he flatters himself in his own eyes_ doubts not of his salvation_ is secure of heaven_ and cheats the world with his vain confidences. ,20250223
So far are we from being able to change them that we can give no account of them; they are a secret to us. Shall we then pretend to know God's counsels_ and the reasons of them? If it were left to us to set the dominion of the stars upon the earth_ we should soon be at a loss. Shall we then teach God how to govern the world?,20250223
So he did at first_ when he stretched out the heavens like a curtain (Ps. civ. 2); and he still continues to keep them stretched out_ and will do so till the general conflagration_ when they shall be rolled together as a scroll_ Rev. vi,20250223
So long a time they held their peace_ to show,20250223
So mean_ and little_ and inconsiderable_ in comparison with God and with the holy angels: so worthless and despicable_ having his original in corruption_ and hastening to corruption. What little reason has man to be proud_ and what great reason to be humble! ,20250223
So sordid and filthy. Man is not pure for he is a worm_ hatched in putrefaction_ and therefore odious to God. Let us therefore wonder at God's condescension in taking such worms as we are into covenant and communion with himself_ especially at the condescension of the Son of God_ in emptying himself so far as to say_ I am a worm_ and no man_ Ps. xxii. 6.,20250223
So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom_ and apply thine heart to understanding,20250223
So that we must necessarily understand him of the redemption of his soul from the power of the grave_ and his reception to glory_ which is spoken of_ Ps. xlix,20250223
So that_ his roots being in his own person dried up beneath_ above his branch (every child of his family) shall be cut off. Thus the houses of Jeroboam_ Baasha_ and Ahab_ were cut off; none that descended from them were left alive. Those who take root in the earth may expect it will thus be dried up; but_ if we be rooted in Christ_ even our leaf shall not wither_ much less shall our branch be cut off. Those who consult the true honour of their family_ and the welfare of its branches_ will be afraid of withering it by sin. The extirpation of the sinner's family is mentioned again (v. 19): He shall neither have son nor nephew_ child nor grandchild_ to enjoy his estate and bear up his name_ nor shall there be any remaining in his dwelling akin to him. Sin entails a curse upon posterity_ and the iniquity of the fathers is often visited upon the children. Herein_ also_ it is probable that Bildad reflects upon the death of Job's children and servants_ as a further proof of his being a wicked man; whereas all that are written childless are not thereby written graceless; there is a name better than that of sons and daughters.,20250223
So uncertain is the friendship of men; but_ if God be our friend_ he will not fail us in a time of need. But let none that pretend either to humanity or Christianity ever use their friends as Job's friends used him: adversity is the proof of friendship,20250223
So we have_ and of his impatience too. We wondered that a man should be so patient as he was (ch. i. and ii.)_ but we wonder also that a good man should be so impatient as he is in this chapter_ where we find him cursing his day_ and_ in passion_,20250223
So weak and impotent_ and so easily crushed_ and therefore a very unequal match for Almighty God. Shall man be such a fool as to contend with his Maker_ who can tread him to pieces more easily than we can a worm? ,20250223
So wretchedly besotted is he that he takes his slothfulness to be his wisdom; he thinks it is his wisdom to make much of himself_ and take all the ease he can get_ and do no more in religion than he needs must_ to avoid suffering_ to sit still and see what other people do_ that he may have the pleasure of finding fault with them. Of such sluggards_ who are proud of that which is their shame_ their is little hope_,20250223
So_ Is this Job? How hast thou fallen! How is thy glory stained and sullied_ and all thy honour laid in the dust! God fits us for such changes! Observing him thus miserably altered_ they did not leave him_ in a fright or loathing_ but expressed so much the more tenderness towards him.,20250223
Solitude and retirement befriend communion with God; therefore Isaac went out into the field to meditate and pray. Enter into thy closet_ and shut thy door. A believer is never less alone than when alone with Christ_ where no eye sees,20250223
Solomon enforces his exhortations with the authority of his father David_ a man famous in his generation upon all accounts. Be it taken notice of_ to the honour of religion_ that the wisest and best men in every age have been most zealous_ not only for the practice of it themselves_ but for the propagating of it to others; and we should therefore continue in the things which we have learned_ knowing of whom we have learned them_ 2 Tim. iii. 14.,20250223
Solomon had a large soul (1 Kings iv. 29) and it appeared by this_ among other things_ that he had a very tender concern for the miserable part of mankind and took cognizance of the afflictions of the afflicted. He had taken the oppressors to task (ch. iii. 16_ 17) and put them in mind of the judgment to come_ to be a curb to their insolence; now here he observes the oppressed. This he did_ no doubt_ as a prince_ to do them justice and avenge them of their adversaries_ for he both feared God and regarded men; but here he does it as a preacher_ and shows_,20250223
Solomon had commended eloquence_ or the sweetness of the lips (v. and seemed to prefer it before wisdom; but here he corrects himself_ as it were_ and shows that unless there be a good treasure within to support the eloquence it is worth little. Wisdom in the heart is the main matter.,20250223
Solomon had given many proofs and instances of the vanity of this world and the things of it; now_ in this chapter_,20250223
Solomon had himself made the observation_ and so has many a one since_ that events_ both in public and private affairs_ do not always agree even with the most rational prospects and probabilities. Nulli fortuna tam dedita est ut multa tentanti ubique respondeat—Fortune surrenders herself to no one so as to ensure him success_ however numerous his undertakings. Seneca. The issue of affairs is often unaccountably cross to every one's expectation_ that the highest may not presume_ nor the lowest despair_ but all may live in a humble dependence upon God_ from whom every man's judgment proceeds.,20250223
Solomon had hitherto been proving the vanity of the world and its utter insufficiency to make men happy; now here he comes to show the vileness of sin_ and its certain tendency to make men miserable; and this_ as the former_ he proves from his own experience_ and it was a dear-bought experience. He is here_ more than any where in all this book_ putting on the habit of a penitent. He reviews what he had been discoursing of already_ and tells us that what he had said was what he knew and was well assured of_ and what he resolved to stand by: All this have I proved by wisdom_ v,20250223
Solomon had often complained before of the oppressions which he saw under the sun_ which gave occasion for many melancholy speculations and were a great discouragement to virtue and piety. Now here_,20250223
Solomon had often_ in this book_ pressed it upon rich people to take the comfort of their riches themselves; here he presses it upon them to do good to others with them and to abound in liberality to the poor_ which will_ another day_ abound to their account. Observe_,20250223
Solomon had pressed us earnestly to seek diligently for wisdom (ch. ii. 1_ &c.)_ and had assured us that we should succeed in our sincere and constant pursuits. But the question is_ What shall we get by it when we have found it? Prospect of advantage is the spring and spur of industry; he therefore shows us how much it will be to our profit_ laying this down for an unquestionable truth_ Happy is the man that findeth wisdom_ that true wisdom which consists in the knowledge and love of God_ and an entire conformity to all the intentions of his truths_ providences_ and laws. Now observe_,20250223
Solomon had said (ch. xxii.,20250223
Solomon had said (v. 5) that a wise man's heart discerns time and judgment_ that is_ a man's wisdom will go a great way_ by the blessing of God_ in moral prognostications; but here he shows that few have that wisdom_ and that even the wisest may yet be surprised by a calamity which they had not any foresight of_ and therefore it is our wisdom to expect and prepare for sudden changes. Observe,20250223
Solomon had said in the foregoing verse that he who has not a large estate_ or a great income_ but a cheerful spirit_ has a continual feast; Christian contentment_ and joy in God_ make the life easy and pleasant; now here he tells us what is necessary to that cheerfulness of spirit which will furnish a man with a continual feast_ though he has but little in the world—holiness and love.,20250223
Solomon had shown the vanity of pleasure_ gaiety_ and fine works_ of honour_ power_ and royal dignity; and there is many a covetous worldling that will agree with him_ and speak as slightly as he does of these things; but money_ he thinks_ is a substantial thing_ and if he can but have enough of that he is happy. This is the mistake which Solomon attacks_ and attempts to rectify_ in these verses; he shows that there is as much vanity in great riches_ and the lust of the eye about them_ as there is in the lusts of the flesh and the pride of life_ and a man can make himself no more happy by hoarding an estate than by spending it.,20250223
Solomon had shown_ in the close of the foregoing chapter_ how good it is to make a comfortable use of the gifts of God's providence; now here he shows the evil of the contrary_ having and not using_ gathering to lay up for I know not what contingent emergencies to come_ not to lay out on the most urgent occasions present. This is an evil which Solomon himself saw under the sun_ v. 1. A great deal of evil there is under the sun. There is a world above the sun where there is no evil_ yet God causes his sun to shine upon the evil as well as upon the good_ which is an aggravation of the evil. God has lighted up a candle for his servants to work by_ but they bury their talent as slothful and unprofitable_ and so waste the light and are unworthy of it. Solomon_ as a king_ inspected the manners of his subjects_ and took notice of this evil as a prejudice to the public_ who are damaged not only by men's prodigality on the one hand_ but by their penuriousness on the other. As it is with the blood in the natural body_ so it is with the wealth of the body politic_ if_ instead of circulating_ it stagnates_ it will be of ill consequence. Solomon as a preacher observed the evils that were done that he might reprove them and warn people against them. This evil was_ in his days_ common_ and yet then there was great plenty of silver and gold_ which_ one would think_ should have made people less fond of riches; the times also were peaceable_ nor was there any prospect of trouble_ which to some is a temptation to hoard. But no providence will of itself_ unless the grace of God work with it_ cure the corrupt affection that is in the carnal mind to the world and the things of it; nay_ when riches increase we are most apt to set our hearts upon them. Now concerning this miser observe_,20250223
Solomon had this in his prayer (1 Kings viii. in his proverbs (Prov. xx. and here in his preaching. Note_ ,20250223
Solomon has often shown what mischief bad men do to others with their ungoverned tongues; here he shows what mischief they do to themselves. 1. They embroil themselves in quarrels: A fool's lips_ without any cause or call_ enter into contention_ by advancing foolish notions which others find themselves obliged to oppose_ and so a quarrel is begun_ or by giving provoking language_ which will be resented_ and satisfaction demanded_ or by setting men at defiance_ and bidding them do if they dare. Proud_ and passionate men_ and drunkards_ are fools_ whose lips enter into contention. A wise man may_ against his will_ be drawn into a quarrel_ but he is a fool that of choice enters into it when he might avoid it_ and he will repent it when it is too late,20250223
Solomon having pronounced all vanity_ and particularly knowledge and learning_ which he was so far from giving himself joy of that he found the increase of it did but increase his sorrow_ in this chapter he goes on to show what reason he has to be tired of this world_ and with what little reason most men are fond of it.,20250223
Solomon having shown the vanity of studies_ pleasures_ and business_ and made it to appear that happiness is not to be found in the schools of the learned_ nor in the gardens of Epicurus_ nor upon the exchange_ he proceeds_ in this chapter_ further to prove his doctrine_ and the inference he had drawn from it_ That therefore we should cheerfully content ourselves with_ and make use of_ what God has given us_ by showing_,20250223
Solomon having tried what satisfaction was to be had in learning first_ and then in the pleasures of sense_ and having also put both together_ here compares them one with another and passes a judgment upon them.,20250223
Solomon here changes his style and manner of speaking. Hitherto_ for the most part_ since the beginning of ch. x._ he had laid down doctrinal truths_ and but now and then dropped a word of exhortation_ leaving us to make the application as we went along; but here_ to the end of ch. xxiv._ he directs his speech to his son_ his pupil_ his reader_ his hearer_ speaking as to a particular person. Hitherto_ for the most part_ his sense was comprised in one verse_ but here usually it is drawn out further. See how Wisdom tries variety of methods with us_ lest we should be cloyed with any one. To awaken attention and to assist our application the method of direct address is here adopted. Ministers must not think it enough to preach before their hearers_ but must preach to them_ nor enough to preach to them all in general_ but should address themselves to particular persons_ as here: Do thou do so and so. Here is_,20250223
Solomon here confirms what his father had said (Ps. xxxvii.,20250223
Solomon here gives fair warning against the sin of drunkenness_ to confirm what he had said_,20250223
Solomon here gives us_,20250223
Solomon here not only asserts that it is better to get wisdom than gold (ch. iii. 14_ viii. but he speaks it with assurance_ that it is much better_ better beyond expression—with admiration (How much better!) as one amazed at the disproportion—with an appeal to men's consciences (__Judge in yourselves how much better it is__ )—and with an addition to the same purport_ that understanding is rather to be chosen than silver and all the treasures of kings and their favourites. Note,20250223
Solomon here observes_,20250223
Solomon here recommends friendship to us_ and shows,20250223
Solomon here shows how much it becomes a man,20250223
Solomon here shows that there is little hope of bringing a man to wisdom that is hasty either_,20250223
Solomon here shows what is the false and deceitful defence of the rich man_ that has his portion and treasure in the things of this world_ and sets his heart upon them. His wealth is as much his confidence_ and he expects as much from it_ as a godly man from his God. See,20250223
Solomon here_ as often in this book_ shows that the poor have in some respects the advantage of the rich; for,20250223
Solomon here_ in pursuit of the summum bonum—the felicity of man_ adjourns out of his study_ his library_ his elaboratory_ his council-chamber_ where he had in vain sought for it_ into the park and the playhouse_ his garden and his summer-house; he exchanges the company of the philosophers and grave senators for that of the wits and gallants_ and the beaux-esprits_ of his court_ to try if he could find true satisfaction and happiness among them. Here he takes a great step downward_ from the noble pleasures of the intellect to the brutal ones of sense; yet_ if he resolve to make a thorough trial_ he must knock at this door_ because here a great part of mankind imagine they have found that which he was in quest of.,20250223
Solomon here_ to enforce the caution he had given against the sin of whoredom_ tells a story of a young man that was ruined to all intents and purposes by the enticements of an adulterous woman. Such a story as this would serve the lewd profane poets of our age to make a play of_ and the harlot with them would be a heroine; nothing would be so entertaining to the audience_ nor give them so much diversion_ as her arts of beguiling the young gentleman and drawing in the country squire; her conquests would be celebrated as the triumphs of wit and love_ and the comedy would conclude very pleasantly; and every young man that saw it acted would covet to be so picked up. Thus fools make a mock at sin. But Solomon here relates it_ and all wise and good men read it_ as a very melancholy story. The impudence of the adulterous woman is very justly looked upon_ by all that have any sparks of virtue in them_ with the highest indignation_ and the easiness of the young man with the tenderest compassion; and the story concludes with sad reflections_ enough to make all that read and hear it afraid of the snares of fleshly lusts and careful to keep at the utmost distance from them. It is supposed to be a parable_ or imagined case_ but I doubt it was too true_ and_ which is worse_ that notwithstanding the warning it gives of the fatal consequences of such wicked courses it is still too often true_ and the agents for hell are still playing the same game and with similar success.,20250223
Solomon himself puts a nota bene before it_ demanding attention in these words_ Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Observe here_,20250223
Solomon is here drawing towards a close_ and is loth to part till he has gained his point_ and prevailed with his hearers_ with his readers_ to seek for that satisfaction in God only and in their duty to him which they can never find in the creature.,20250223
Solomon is still showing that every thing in this world_ without piety and the fear of God_ is vanity. Take away religion_ and there is nothing valuable among men_ nothing for the sake of which a wise man would think it worth while to live in this world. In these verses he shows that power (than which there is nothing men are more ambitious of) and life itself (than which there is nothing men are more fond_ more jealous of) are nothing without the fear of God.,20250223
Solomon lays down his conclusion which he had undertaken to prove_ as that which was fully confirmed by the foregoing discourse: There be many things that increase vanity; the life of man is vain_ at the best_ and there are abundance of accidents that concur to make it more so; even that which pretends to increase the vanity and make it more vexatious,20250223
Solomon often repeats this remark_ probably because it was his own case; however_ it is a common case.,20250223
Solomon perceived_ by what he had read of former times_ what he heard of other countries_ and what he had seen in some corrupt judges_ even in the land of Israel_ notwithstanding all his care to prefer good men_ that there was wickedness in the place of judgment. It is not so above the sun: far be it from God that he should do iniquity_ or pervert justice. But under the sun it is often found that that which should be the refuge_ proves the prison_ of oppressed innocency. Man being in honour_ and not understanding what he ought to do_ becomes like the beasts that perish_ like the beasts of prey_ even the most ravenous_ Ps. xlix,20250223
Solomon says_ __Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof___ Eccl. vii,20250223
Solomon still recommends wisdom to us as necessary to the preserving of our peace and the perfecting of our business_ notwithstanding the vanities and crosses which human affairs are subject to. He had said (v.,20250223
Solomon was a magistrate_ and_ as such_ inspected the manners of his subjects_ looked often through his casement_ that he might see with his own eyes_ and made remarks upon those who little thought his eye was upon them_ that he might know the better how to make the sword he bore a terror to evil-doers. But here he writes as a minister_ a prophet_ who is by office a watchman_ to give warning of the approach of the enemies_ and especially where they lie in ambush_ that we may not be ignorant of Satan's devices_ but may know where to double our guard. This Solomon does here_ where we may observe the account he gives_,20250223
Solomon was himself a king_ and therefore may be allowed to speak more freely than another concerning the vanity of kingly state and dignity_ which he shows here to be an uncertain thing; he had before said so (Prov. xxvii. 24_ The crown doth not endure to every generation)_ and his son found it so. Nothing is more slippery than the highest post of honour without wisdom and the people's love.,20250223
Solomon's design_ in driving us off from the world_ by showing us its vanity_ is to drive us to God and to our duty_ that we may not walk in the way of the world_ but by religious rules_ nor depend upon the wealth of the world_ but on religious advantages; and therefore_,20250223
Solomon_ as conservator of the public peace_ here tells us,20250223
Solomon_ from the vanity of riches hoarded up_ here infers that the best course we can take is to use well what we have_ to serve God with it_ to do good with it_ and take the comfort of it to ourselves and our families; this he had pressed before_ ch. ii. 24; iii,20250223
Solomon_ having asserted in general that all is vanity_ and having given some general proofs of it_ now takes the most effectual method to evince the truth of it,20250223
Solomon_ having been well educated by his parents_ thought himself thereby obliged to give his children a good education_ the same that his parents had given him; and this is one way in which we must requite our parents for the pains they took with us_ even by showing piety at home_ 1 Tim. v,20250223
Solomon_ having foretold the destruction of those who are obstinate in their impiety_ in this chapter applies himself to those who are willing to be taught; and_,20250223
Solomon_ having pronounced those happy who not only lay hold on wisdom_ but retain her_ here exhorts us therefore to retain her_ assuring us that we ourselves shall have the comfort of doing so.,20250223
Solomon_ having shown how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations of Satan_ here shows how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of God_ which we shall for ever rue the neglect of. Observe_,20250223
Solomon_ having shown the benefit of wisdom_ and of what great advantage it is to us in the management of our affairs_ here shows the mischief of folly and how it exposes men_ which perhaps comes in as a reflection upon those rulers who set folly in great dignity.,20250223
Solomon_ having shown the great evil that there is in adultery and fornication_ and all such lewd and filthy courses_ here prescribes remedies against them.,20250223
Solomon_ having shown the vanity of this world in the temptation which those in power feel to oppress and trample upon their subjects_ here further shows_,20250223
Solomon_ having undertaken to teach a young man knowledge and discretion_ here lays down two general rules to be observed in order thereunto_ and those are_ to fear God and honour his parents_ which two fundamental laws of morality Pythagoras begins his golden verses with_ but the former of them in a wretchedly corrupted state. Primum_ deos immortales cole_ parentesque honora—First worship the immortal gods_ and honour your parents. To make young people such as they should be_,20250223
Solomon_ having warned us not to do evil_ here teaches us how to do well. It is not enough for us to shun the occasions of sin_ but we must study the methods of duty.,20250223
Solomon_ in a fret_ had praised the dead more than the living (ch. iv. 2); but here_ considering the advantages of life to prepare for death and make sure the hope of a better life_ he seems to be of another mind.,20250223
Solomon_ in the beginning of the chapter_ had warned us against having any thing to do with seditious subjects; here_ in these verses_ he encourages us_ in reference to the mischief of tyrannical and oppressive rulers_ such as he had complained of before_ ch. iii. 16; iv. 1.,20250223
Solomon_ in these verses_ addresses himself to the sluggard who loves his ease_ lives in idleness_ minds no business_ sticks to nothing_ brings nothing to pass_ and in a particular manner is careless in the business of religion. Slothfulness is as sure a way to poverty_ though not so short a way_ as rash suretiship. He speaks here to the sluggard_,20250223
Solomon_ in these verses_ recommends wisdom to us as the best antidote against those distempers of mind which we are liable to_ by reason of the vanity and vexation of spirit that there are in the things of this world. Here are some of the praises and the precepts of wisdom.,20250223
Solomon_ in this chapter_ comes to recommend wisdom to us as the most powerful antidote against both the temptations and vexations that arise from the vanity of the world. Here is_,20250223
Solomon_ in this chapter_ discourses_,20250223
Solomon_ in this chapter_ for a further proof of the vanity of this world_ gives us four observations which he had made upon a survey of the state of the children of men in it:—I. He observed that commonly as to outward things_ good and bad men fare much alike_ ver. 1-3.,20250223
Solomon_ speaking to us as unto children_ observes here how much the comfort of parents_ natural_ political_ and ecclesiastical_ depends upon the good behaviour of those under their charge_ as a reason,20250223
Solomon_ who_ in the days of his folly_ had set his wits on work to invent pleasures and sharpen them_ and was ingenious in making provision for the flesh_ now that God had opened his eyes is as industrious to find out the aggravations of sin and so to put an edge upon his repentance. Ingenious sinners should be ingenious penitents_ and wit and learning_ among the other spoils of the strong man armed_ should be divided by the Lord Jesus. ,20250223
Some account of him_ his parentage_ his presence at this dispute_ and his sentiments concerning it_ ver. 1-5.,20250223
Some apply these to the two Testaments; others to the two sacraments_ the seals of the covenant of grace; others to ministers_ who are to be spiritual nurses to the children of God and to give out to them the sincere milk of the word_ that they may grow thereby_ and_ in order to that_ are themselves to feed among the lilies where Christ feeds (ch. ii. that they may be to the babes of the church as full breasts. Or the breasts of a believer are his love to Christ_ which he is pleased with_ as a tender husband is with the affections of his wife_ who is therefore said to be to him as the loving hind and the pleasant roe_ because her breasts satisfy him at all times_ Prov. v,20250223
Some are abusive to those that are in trouble_ and add affliction to the afflicted. Barrenness was looked upon as a great reproach_ and those that fall under that affliction they upbraid with it_ as Peninnah did Hannah_ on purpose to vex them and make them to fret_ which is a barbarous thing. This is evil entreating the barren that beareth not (v. or those that are childless_ and so want the arrows others have in their quiver_ which enable them to deal with their enemy in the gate_ Ps. cxxvii,20250223
Some are praised above what is their due_ but those that praise her do but give her of the fruit of her hands; they give her that which she has dearly earned and which is justly due to her; she is wronged if she have it not. Note_ Those ought to be praised the fruit of whose hands is praise-worthy. The tree is known by its fruits_ and therefore_ if the fruit be good_ the tree must have our good word. If her children be dutiful and respectful to her_ and conduct themselves as they ought_ they then give her the fruit of her hands; she reaps the benefit of all the care she has taken of them_ and thinks herself well paid. Children must thus study to requite their parents_ and this is showing piety at home_ 1 Tim. v,20250223
Some are so bad that rough and severe methods must be used with them_ after gentle means have been tried in vain; they must be brayed in a mortar. God will take this way with them by his judgments; the magistrates must take this way with them by the rigour of the law. Force must be used with those that will not be ruled by reason_ and love_ and their own interest,20250223
Some are so incorrigibly bad that even those rough and severe methods do not answer the end_ their foolishness will not depart from them_ so fully are their hearts set in them to do evil; they are often under the rod and yet not humbled_ in the furnace and yet not refined_ but_ like Ahaz_ trespass yet more (2 Chron. xxviii. 22); and what remains then but that they should be rejected as reprobate silver?,20250223
Some general precepts of wisdom and virtue.,20250223
Some give another sense of it: The righteous man (the judge or magistrate_ that is entrusted with the execution of justice_ and the preservation of public peace) examines the house of the wicked_ searches it for arms or for stolen goods_ makes a diligent enquiry concerning his family and the characters of those about him_ that he may by his power overthrow the wicked for their wickedness and prevent their doing any further mischief_ that he may fire the nests where the birds of prey are harboured or the unclean birds.,20250223
Some give another sense of this verse: To eat much honey is not good_ but to search into glorious and excellent things is a great commendation_ it is true glory; we cannot therein offend by excess. Others thus: __As honey_ though pleasant to the taste_ if used immoderately_ oppresses the stomach_ so an over-curious search into things sublime and glorious_ though pleasant to us_ if we pry too far_ will overwhelm our capacities with a greater glory and lustre than they can bear.__ Or thus: __You may be surfeited with eating too much honey_ but the last of glory_ of their glory_ the glory of the blessed_ is glory; it will be ever fresh_ and never pall the appetite.__,20250223
Some give this sense of it: __So mutable is even the angelical nature that God would not trust angels with their own integrity; if he had_ they would all have done as some did_ left their first estate; but he saw it necessary to give them supernatural grace to confirm them.__ ,20250223
Some humbling mortifying judgments are brought upon them; these wicked rulers are stricken as other wicked men_ as surely_ as sorely_ stricken in their bodies_ estates_ or families_ and this for warning to their neighbours; the stroke is given in terrorem—as an alarm to others_ and therefore is given in the open sight of others_ that they also may see and fear_ and tremble before the justice of God. If kings stand not before him_ how shall we stand!,20250223
Some make Agur to be not the name of this author_ but his character; he was a collector (so it signifies)_ a gatherer_ one that did not compose things himself_ but collected the wise sayings and observations of others_ made abstracts of the writings of others_ which some think is the reason why he says (v.,20250223
Some make David's instructions to Solomon_ which began v. 4_ to continue to the end of the chapter; nay_ some continue them to the end of the ninth chapter; but it is more probable that Solomon begins here again_ if not sooner. In these verses_ having exhorted us to walk in the paths of wisdom_ he cautions us against the path of the wicked. 1. We must take heed of the ways of sin and avoid them_ every thing that looks like sin and leads to it,20250223
Some make Job to complain here that God dealt unjustly and unfairly with him in proceeding to punish him without the least relenting or relaxation_ though he had such incontestable evidences to produce of his innocency. I am loth to think holy Job would charge the holy God with iniquity; but his complaint is indeed bitter and peevish_ and he reasons himself into a sort of patience per force_ which he cannot do without reflecting upon God as dealing hardly with him_ but he must bear it because he cannot help it; the worst he says is that God deals unaccountably with him.,20250223
Some make Job to speak of wisdom here as a person_ and translate it_ Then he saw her and showed her_ &c._ and then it is parallel with that of Solomon concerning the essential wisdom of the Father_ the eternal Word_ Prov. viii. 22_ &c. Before the earth was_ then was I by him_ John i. 1_ 2.,20250223
Some make this to be the language of an atheist_ who justifies himself in his iniquity (v. 16) and evades the argument taken from the judgment to come (v. 17) by pleading that there is not another life after this_ but that when man dies there is an end of him_ and therefore while he lives he may live as he lists; but others rather think Solomon here speaks as he himself thinks_ and that it is to be understood in the same sense with that of his father (Ps. xlix.,20250223
Some observe that here is a time to be born and a time to die_ but no time to live; that is so short that it is not worth mentioning; as soon as we are born we begin to die. But_ as there is a time to be born and a time to die_ so there will be a time to rise again_ a set time when those that lie in the grave shall be remembered_ Job xiv. 13,20250223
Some of each sex_ and more of the more noble sex_ in which the family is built up. Children must be looked upon as blessings_ for so they are_ especially to good people_ that will give them good instructions_ and set them good examples_ and put up good prayers for them. Job had many children_ and yet he was neither oppressive nor uncharitable_ but very liberal to the poor_ ch. xxxi. 17_ &c. Those that have great families to provide for ought to consider that what is prudently given in alms is set out to the best interest and put into the best fund for their children's benefit,20250223
Some of the precepts of wisdom_ that wisdom which will be of so much advantage to us. 1. We must have an eye to God and to his hand in every thing that befals us (v. 13): Consider the work of God. To silence our complaints concerning cross events_ let us consider the hand of God in them and not open our mouths against that which is his doing; let us look upon the disposal of our condition and all the circumstances of it as the work of God_ and consider it as the product of his eternal counsel_ which is fulfilled in every thing that befals us. Consider that every work of God is wise_ just_ and good_ and there is an admirable beauty and harmony in his works_ and all will appear at last to have been for the best. Let us therefore give him the glory of all his works concerning us_ and study to answer his designs in them. Consider the work of God as that which we cannot make any alteration of. Who can make that straight which he has made crooked? Who can change the nature of things from what is settled by the God of nature? If he speak trouble_ who can make peace? And_ if he hedge up the way with thorns_ who can get forward? If desolating judgments go forth with commission_ who can put a stop to them? Since therefore we cannot mend God's work_ we ought to make the best of it.,20250223
Some of them shall die by the sword_ the sword of war perhaps (they brought them up to live by their sword_ as Esau_ Gen. xxvii. 40_ and those that do so commonly die by the sword_ first or last)_ or by the sword of justice for their crimes_ or the sword of the murderer for their estates. ,20250223
Some particular instances of wisdom prescribed to us. 1. We must keep in due subjection to the government God has set over us_ ver. 2-5,20250223
Some read v. 36 as an appeal to God: O_ my Father! let Job be tried. So the margin of our Bibles_ for the same word signifies my desire and my father; and some suppose that he lifted up his eyes when he said this_ meaning_ __O my Father who art in heaven! let Job be tried till he be subdued.__ When we are praying for the benefit of afflictions either to ourselves or others we must eye God as a Father_ because they are fatherly corrections and a part of our filial education_ Heb. xii,20250223
Some take it for a scornful question_ blaming her for making such ado about him: __Why shouldst thou be so passionate in enquiring after thy beloved_ more than others are after theirs? Why shouldst thou be so set upon him_ more than others that yet have a kindness for him?__ Those that are zealous in religion are men wondered at by such as are indifferent to it. The many careless ones laugh at the few that are solicitous and serious. __What is there in him that is so very charming_ more than in another person? If he be gone_ thou_ who art the fairest among women_ wilt soon have another with an equal flame.__ Note_ Carnal hearts see nothing excellent or extraordinary in the Lord Jesus_ in his person or offices_ in his doctrine or in his favours; as if there were no more in the knowledge of Christ_ and in communion with him_ than in the knowledge of the world and in its conversation. ,20250223
Some that are really rich would be thought to be poor_ and are thought to be so_ because they sordidly and meanly live below what God has given them_ and choose rather to bury it than to use it_ Eccl. vi. 1_ 2. In this there is an ingratitude to God_ injustice to the family and neighbourhood_ and uncharitableness to the poor.,20250223
Some think he pleads this for relief: __Lord_ my patience will not hold out always; even rocks and mountains will fail at last; therefore cease the controversy.__,20250223
Some think it is intimated (Ps. xxix. 9) that God by thunder helps the hinds in calving. Let it be observed_ for the comfort of women in labour_ that God helps even the hinds to bring forth their young; and shall he not much more succour them_ and save them in child-bearing_ who are his children in covenant with him? 2. Concerning the growth of their young_,20250223
Some think she gives this account of herself; she is shy of appearing_ unwilling to be looked upon_ having_ in her own account_ no form or comeliness. Alas! says she_ What will you see in the Shulamite? nothing that is worth your looking upon_ nothing but as it were the company of two armies actually engaged_ where nothing is to be seen but blood and slaughter. The watchmen had smitten her_ and wounded her_ and she carried in her face the marks of those wounds_ looked as if she had been fighting. She had said (ch. i.,20250223
Some think that in attributing the destruction of sinners to the blast of God_ and the breath of his nostrils_ he refers to the wind which blew the house down upon Job's children_ as if they were therefore sinners above all men because they suffered such things. Luke xiii. 2.,20250223
Some understand it figuratively: they sin against the light of nature_ the light of God's law_ and that of their own consciences; they profess to know God_ but they rebel against the knowledge they have of him_ and will not be guided and governed_ commanded and controlled_ by it. Others understand it literally: they have the day-light and choose the night as the most advantageous season for their wickedness. Sinful works are therefore called works of darkness_ because he that does evil hates the light (John iii. knows not the ways thereof_ that is_ keeps out of the way of it_ or_ if he happen to be seen_ abides not where he thinks he is known. So that he here describes the worst of sinners_—those that sin wilfully_ and against the convictions of their own consciences_ whereby they add rebellion to their sin_—those that sin deliberately_ and with a great deal of plot and contrivance_ using a thousand arts to conceal their villanies_ fondly imagining that_ if they can but hide them from the eye of men_ they are safe_ but forgetting that there is no darkness or shadow of death in which the workers of iniquity can hide themselves from God's eye_ ch. xxxiv,20250223
Some understand it of the trunk of the elephant_ for the word signifies any extreme part_ and in that there is indeed a wonderful strength. So strong is the elephant in his back and loins_ and the sinews of his thighs_ that he will carry a large wooden tower_ and a great number of fighting men in it. No animal whatsoever comes near the elephant for strength of body_ which is the main thing insisted on in this description.,20250223
Some understand this of righteous Noah and his family_ who beheld the destruction of the old world and rejoiced in it_ as he had grieved for their impiety. Lot_ who saw the ruin of Sodom_ had the same reason to rejoice_ 2 Pet.,20250223
Some understand this of the clearing up of his credit before men_ Ps. xxxvii,20250223
Something that is peculiar to itself,20250223
Sometimes God extorts_ even from bad men_ an acknowledgement of the excellency of God's people. The evil ought always to bow before the good_ and sometimes they are made to do it and to know that God has loved them_ Rev. iii,20250223
Sometimes God in his providence so orders it that that which one got unjustly another uses charitably; it is strangely turned into the hands of one that will pity the poor and do good with it_ and so cut off the entail of the curse which he brought upon it who got it by deceit and violence. Thus the same Providence that punishes the cruel_ and disables them to do any more hurt_ rewards the merciful_ and enables them to do so much the more good. To him that has the ten pounds give the pound which the wicked servant hid in the napkin; for to him that has_ and uses it well_ more shall be given_ Luke xix,20250223
Sometimes favoured; for they serve as an umbrella to shelter us from the violent heat of the sun_ which otherwise would beat upon us. A cloud of dew in the heat of harvest is spoken of as a very great refreshment. Isa. xviii,20250223
Sometimes the fear of the Jews was upon their neighbours_ when they saw that God was with them of a truth_ Esth. viii. 17,20250223
Sometimes we are by them frowned upon; for they darken the earth at noon-day and eclipse the light of the sun. Sin is compared to a cloud (Isa. xliv. because it comes between us and the light of God's countenance and obstructs the shining of it. But though the clouds darken the sun for a time_ and pour down rain_ yet (post nubila Phoebus—the sun shines forth after the rain)_ after he has wearied the cloud_ he spreads his light upon it_ v,20250223
Sometimes we need and deserve those reproofs ourselves which we have given to others. Those that reproach God's wisdom really reproach their own. ,20250223
Sorrowful_ ver. 1,20250223
Soul and body shall come together again. That body which must be destroyed in the grave shall be raised again_ a glorious body: Yet in my flesh I shall see God. The separate soul has eyes wherewith to see God_ eyes of the mind; but Job speaks of seeing him with eyes of flesh_ in my flesh_ with my eyes; the same body that died shall rise again_ a true body_ but a glorified body_ fit for the employments and entertainments of that world_ and therefore a spiritual body_ 1 Cor. xv,20250223
Soul_ take thy ease.,20250223
Soul_ take thy ease. But really they are enemies to themselves; for_ besides that their slothfulness starves them_ depriving them of their necessary supports_ their desires at the same time stab them. Though their hands refuse to labour_ their hearts cease not to covet riches_ and pleasures_ and honours_ which yet cannot be obtained without labour. Their desires are impetuous and insatiable; they covet greedily all the day long_ and cry_ Give_ give; they expect every body should do for them_ though they will do nothing for themselves_ much less for any body else. Now these desires kill them; they are a perpetual vexation to them_ fret them to death_ and perhaps put them upon such dangerous courses for the satisfying of their craving lusts as hasten them to an untimely end. Many that must have money with which to make provision for the flesh_ and would not be at the pains to get it honestly_ have turned highwaymen_ and that has killed them. Those that are slothful in the affairs of their souls_ and yet have desires towards that which would be the happiness of their souls_ those desires kill them_ will aggravate their condemnation and be witnesses against them that were convinced of the worth of spiritual blessings_ but refused to be at the pains that were necessary to the obtaining of them,20250223

Stripes are not enough for a fool_ to make him sensible of his errors_ that he may repent of them_ and be more cautious for the future. He that is sottish and wilful is very rarely benefited by severity. David is softened with_ Thou art the man; but Pharaoh remains hard under all the plagues of Egypt.,20250223

Submission to the will of God in all events_ accommodating ourselves to every condition_ ver. 13-15,20250223
Submissively_ and with a willing heart (v. 33): __Hear instruction_ and refuse it not_ either as that which you need not or as that which you like not; it is offered you as a kindness_ and it is at your peril if you refuse it.__ Those that reject the counsel of God reject it against themselves_ Luke vii,20250223
Submit to the chastening_ and study to answer the call_ to answer the end of it_ and then you reverence it.__ When God by an affliction draws upon us for some of the effects he has entrusted us with we must honour his bill by accepting it_ and subscribing it_ resigning him his own when he calls for it.,20250223
Subtlety in the contrivance of sin_ wisdom to do evil_ a heart that designs and a head that devises wicked imaginations_ that is acquainted with the depths of Satan and knows how to carry on a covetous_ envious_ revengeful plot_ most effectually. The more there is of craft and management in sin the more it is an abomination to God,20250223
Such a dread he has of poverty_ and such a waste does he discern upon his estate_ that he is already_ in his own imagination_ wandering abroad for bread_ going a begging for a meal's meat_ and saying_ Where is it? The rich man_ in his abundance_ cried out_ What shall I do? Luke,20250223
Such a thing is sin; it is turned into the gall of asps_ than which nothing is more bitter_ the poison of asps (v. than which nothing more fatal_ and so it will be to him; what he sucked so sweetly_ and with so much pleasure_ will prove to him the poison of asps; so will all unlawful gains be. The fawning tongue will prove the viper's tongue. All the charming graces that are thought to be in sin will_ when conscience is awakened_ turn into so many raging furies. ,20250223
Such as (like Satan still) do all they can to entice and draw in others to join with them in doing mischief_ leading them in a way that is not good_ that is not honest_ nor honourable_ nor safe_ but offensive to God_ and which will be in the end pernicious to the sinner. Thus he aims to ruin some in this world by bringing them into trouble_ and others in the other world by bringing them into sin.,20250223
Such as are conceited of themselves_ and_ under a show and pretence of sanctity_ hide from others_ and perhaps from themselves too_ abundance of reigning wickedness in secret (v. 12); they are pure in their own eyes_ as if they were in all respects such as they should be. They have a very good opinion of themselves and their own character_ that they are not only righteous_ but rich and increased with goods (Rev. iii. and yet are not cleansed from their filthiness_ the filthiness of their hearts_ which they pretend to be the best part of them. They are_ it may be_ swept and garnished_ but they are not washed_ nor sanctified; as the Pharisees that within were full of all uncleanness_ Matt. xxiii. 25_ 26,20250223
Such as are cruel to the poor and barbarous to all that lie at their mercy (v. 14); their teeth are iron and steel_ swords and knives_ instruments of cruelty_ with which they devour the poor with the greatest pleasure imaginable_ and as greedily as hungry men cut their meat and eat it. God has so ordered it that the poor we shall always have with us_ that they shall never cease out of the land; but there are those who_ because they hate to relieve them_ would_ if they could_ abolish them from the earth_ from among men_ especially God's poor. Some understand it of those who wound and ruin others by slanders and false accusations_ and severe censures of their everlasting state; their tongues_ and their teeth too (which are likewise organs of speech)_ are as swords and knives_ Ps. lvii. 4.,20250223
Such as are haughty and scornful to those about them_ v,20250223
Such as are openly abusive: The scorner_ who gives ill-language to every body_ takes a pleasure in affronting people and reflecting upon them_ is an abomination to men; none that have any sense of honour and virtue will care to keep company with him. The seat of the scornful is the pestilential chair (as the LXX. calls it_ Ps. i. 1)_ which no wise man will come near_ for fear of taking the infection. Those that strive to make others odious do but make themselves so.,20250223
Such as are secretly malicious. Though they speak courteously and conduct themselves plausibly_ they devise to do evil_ are contriving to do an ill turn to those they bear a grudge to_ or have an envious eye at. He that does so shall be called a mischievous person_ or a master of mischief_ which perhaps was then a common name of reproach; he shall be branded as an inventor of evil things (Rom. i. or if any mischief be done_ he shall be suspected as the author of it_ or at least accessory to it. This devising evil is the thought of foolishness_ v,20250223
Such as envy a man the comfort of his friendship_ and do all they can to break that_ by suggesting that on both sides which will set those at variance that are most nearly related and have been long intimate_ or at least cool and alienate their affections one from another: A froward man_ that cannot find in his heart to love any body but himself_ is vexed to see others live in love_ and therefore makes it is his business to sow strife_ by giving men base characters one of another_ telling lies_ and carrying ill-natured stories between chief friends_ so as to separate them one from another_ and make them angry at or at least suspicious of one another. Those are bad men_ and bad women too_ that do such ill offices; they are doing the devil's work_ and his will their wages be.,20250223
Such too is the frailty of our bodies_ and the vanity of all our enjoyments_ that our troubles also thence arise as naturally as the sparks fly upwards—so many are they_ so thick and so fast does one follow another. Why then should we be surprised at our afflictions as strange_ or quarrel with them as hard_ when they are but what we are born to? Man is born to labour (so it is in the margin)_ is sentenced to eat his bread in the sweat of his face_ which should inure him to hardness_ and make him bear his afflictions the better.,20250223

Taking an entire complacency in Christ. It is spoken of here with an air of triumph: __This is he whom I have chosen_ and to whom I have given up myself. None but Christ_ none but Christ. This is he on whom my heart is_ for he is my best-beloved; this is he in whom I trust_ and from whom I expect all good_ for this is my friend.__ Note_ Those that make Christ their beloved shall have him their friend; he has been_ is_ and will be_ a special friend to all believers. He loves those that love him; and those that have him their friend have reason to glory in him_ and speak of him with delight. __Let others be governed by the love of the world_ and seek their happiness in its friendship and favours_ This is my beloved and this is my friend. Others may do as they please_ but this is my soul's choice_ my soul's rest_ my life_ my joy_ my all; this is he whom I desire to live and die with.__,20250223
Tale-bearers are those who secretly carry stories from house to house_ which perhaps have some truth in them_ but are secrets not fit to be told_ or are basely misrepresented_ and false colours put upon them_ and are all told with design to blast men's reputation_ to break their friendship_ to make mischief between relations and neighbours_ and set them at variance. Now the words of such are here said to be,20250223
Talking_ without working_ will make men poor. Those that love to boast of their business and make a noise about it_ and that waste their time in tittle-tattle_ in telling and hearing new things_ like the Athenians_ and_ under pretence of improving themselves by conversation_ neglect the work of their place and day_ they waste what they have_ and the course they take tends to penury_ and will end in it. It is true in the affairs of our souls; those that take pains in the service of God_ that strive earnestly in prayer_ will find profit in it. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise_ and their praying is only the labour of the lips_ they will be spiritually poor_ and come to nothing.,20250223
Tell him of law and equity_ that the scriptures and an oath are sacred things_ and not to be jested with_ that there will come a reckoning day; he laughs at it all_ and scorns to heed it,20250223

Tell him of the divine wrath_ and its terrors; he bids the Almighty do his worst_ he will have his will_ he will have his way_ in spite of him_ and will not be controlled by law_ or conscience_ or the notices of a judgment to come. He stretches out his hand against God_ in defiance of him and of the power of his wrath. God is indeed out of his reach_ but he stretches out his hand against him_ to show that_ if it were in his power_ he would ungod him. This applies to the audacious impiety of some sinners who are really haters of God (Rom. i. and whose carnal mind is not only an enemy to him_ but enmity itself_ Rom. viii,20250223
Temptations to curse God ought to be rejected with the greatest abhorrence_ and not so much as to be parleyed with. Whoever persuades us to that must be looked upon as our enemy_ to whom if we yield it is at our peril Job did not curse God and then think to come off with Adam's excuse: __The woman whom thou gavest to be with me persuaded me to do it__ (Gen. iii. which had in it a tacit reflection on God_ his ordinance and providence. No; if thou scornest_ if thou cursest_ thou alone shalt bear it.,20250223
Terrors attend these pleasures like the terrors of death itself. The giants are there—Rephaim. It was this that ruined the sinners of the old world_ the giants that were in the earth in those days. Her guests_ that are treated with those stolen waters_ are not only in the highway to hell and at the brink of it_ but they are already in the depths of hell_ under the power of sin_ led captive by Satan at his will_ and ever and anon lashed by the terrors of their own consciences_ which are a hell upon earth The depths of Satan are the depths of hell. Remorseless sin is remediless ruin; it is the bottomless pit already. Thus does Solomon show the hook; those that believe him will not meddle with the bait.,20250223
Testimony of Conscience; Job's Comfort in Conscious Integrity. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Than live_ and die so at fourscore.,20250223
That,20250223
That Elihu does not join with his three friends against him. He has_ in the foregoing chapter_ declared his dislike of their proceedings_ disclaimed their hypothesis_ and quite set aside the method they took of healing Job. __Wherefore_ Job_ I pray thee_ hear my speech_ v. 1. They were all in the same song_ all spoke in the same strain; but I am trying a new say_ therefore hearken to all my words_ and not to some of them only;__ for we cannot judge of a discourse unless we take it entire and hearken to it all,20250223
That God adorned them with great beauty_ no women so fair as the daughters of Job_ v,20250223
That God and his cause did not need such advocates: __Will you think to contend for God_ as if his justice were clouded and wanted to be cleared up_ or as if he were at a loss what to say and wanted you to speak for him? Will you_ who are so weak and passionate_ put in for the honour of pleading God's cause?__ Good work ought not to be put into bad hands. Will you accept his person? If those who have not right on their side carry their cause_ it is by the partiality of the judge in favour of their persons; but God's cause is so just that it needs no such methods for the support of it. He is a God_ and can plead for himself (Judg.,20250223
That God can easily_ and in a moment_ put an end to our lives_ and send us to another world (v. 8): __Thy eyes are upon me and I am not; thou canst look me into eternity_ frown me into the grave_ when thou pleasest.__,20250223
That God did appear against him. That which he here says of God is one of the worst words that ever Job spoke (v. 21): Thou hast become cruel to me. Far be it from the God of mercy and grace that he should be cruel to any (his compassions fail not)_ but especially that he should be so to his own children. Job was unjust and ungrateful when he said so of him: but harbouring hard thoughts of God was the sin which did_ at this time_ most easily beset him. Here_ ,20250223
That God did not appear for him. He addressed himself to him_ but gained no grant—appealed to him_ but gained no sentence; he was very importunate in his applications_ but in vain (v. 20): __I cry unto thee_ as one in earnest_ I stand up_ and cry_ as one waiting for an answer_ but thou hearest not_ thou regardest not_ for any thing I can perceive.__ If our most fervent prayers bring not in speedy and sensible returns_ we must not think it strange. Though the seed of Jacob did never seek in vain_ yet they have often thought that they did and that God has not only been deaf_ but angry_ at the prayers of his people_ Ps. lxxx.,20250223
That God is an absolute sovereign: He exalts by his own power_ and not by strength derived from any other. He exalts whom he pleases_ exalts those that were afflicted and cast down_ by the strength and power which he gives his people; and therefore who has enjoined him his way? Who presides above him in his way? Is there any superior from whom he has his commission and to whom he is accountable? No; he himself is supreme and independent. Who puts him in mind of his way? so some. Does the eternal Mind need a remembrancer? No; his own way_ as well as ours_ is ever before him. He has not received orders or instructions from any (Isa. lx. 13_ nor is he accountable to any. He enjoins to all the creatures their way; let not us then enjoin him his_ but leave it to him to govern the world_ who is fit to do it.,20250223
That God is infinitely above us_ and therefore it is madness to contend with him; for if he plead against us with his great power we cannot stand before him. I will answer thee_ says Elihu_ in one word_ which carries its own evidence along with it_ That God is greater than man; no doubt he is_ infinitely greater. Between God and man there is no proportion. Job had himself said a great deal_ and admirably well_ concerning the greatness of God_ his irresistible power and incontestable sovereignty_ his terrible majesty and unsearchable immensity. __Now___ said Elihu_ __do but consider what thou thyself hast said concerning the greatness of God_ and apply it to thyself; if he is greater than man_ he is greater than thou_ and thou wilt see reason enough to repent of these ill-natures_ ill-favoured_ reflections upon him_ and to blush at thy folly_ and tremble to think of thy own presumption.__ Note_ There is enough in this one plain unquestionable truth_ That God is greater than man_ if duly improved_ for ever to put to silence and to shame all our complaints of his providence and our exceptions against his dealings with us. He is not only more wise and powerful than we are_ and therefore it is to no purpose to contend with him who will be too hard for us_ but more holy_ just_ and good_ for these are the transcendent glories and excellencies of the divine nature; in these God is greater than man_ and therefore it is absurd and unreasonable to find fault with him_ for he is certainly in the right. ,20250223
That God is not accountable to us (v. 13): Why dost thou strive against him? Those that complain of God strive against him_ implead him_ impeach him_ bring an action against him. And why do they do so? For what cause? To what purpose? Note_ It is an unreasonable thing for us_ weak_ foolish_ sinful_ creatures_ to strive with a God of infinite wisdom_ power_ and goodness. Woe to the clay that strives with the potter; for he gives no account of any of his matters. He is under no obligation to show us a reason for what he does_ neither to tell us what he designs to do (in what method_ at what time_ by what instruments) nor to tell us why he deals thus with us. He is not bound either to justify his own proceedings or to satisfy our demands and enquiries; his judgments will certainly justify themselves. If we do not satisfy ourselves in them_ it is our own fault. It is therefore daring impiety for us to arraign God at our bar_ or challenge him to show cause for what he doeth_ to say unto him_ What doest thou? or_ Why doest thou so? He gives not account of all his matters (so some read it); he reveals as much as it is fit for us to know_ as follows here,20250223
That God is the first cause. He is the former of all things and all persons_ the fountain of being; he gave every creature the being it has and appointed it its place. Even the wicked are his creatures_ though they are rebels; he gave them those powers with which they fight against him_ which aggravates their wickedness_ that they will not let him that made them rule them_ and therefore_ though he made them_ he will not save them,20250223
That God is the last end. All is of him and from him_ and therefore all is to him and for him. He made all according to his will and for his praise; he designed to serve his own purposes by all his creatures_ and he will not fail of his designs; all are his servants. The wicked he is not glorified by_ but he will be glorified upon. He makes no man wicked_ but he made those who he foresaw would be wicked: yet he made them (Gen. vi. because he knew how to get himself honour upon them. See Rom. ix,20250223
That God may be honoured_ may be justified_ may be glorified—that they might clear God (so the margin reads it)_ that if men have an uneasy life in this world_ full of vanity and vexation_ they may thank themselves and lay no blame on God; let them clear him_ and not say that he made this world to be man's prison and life to be his penance; no_ God made man_ in respect both of honour and comfort_ little lower than the angels; if he be mean and miserable_ it is his own fault. Or_ that God (that is_ the world of God) might manifest them_ and discover them to themselves_ and so appear to be quick and powerful_ and a judge of men's characters; and we may be made sensible how open we lie to God's knowledge and judgment. ,20250223
That God punished such by secret judgments and reserves them for future judgments (ver. 18-20_ and 23-25)_ so that_ upon the whole matter_ we cannot say that all who are in trouble are wicked; for it is certain that all who are in prosperity are not righteous.,20250223
That God was the author of it_ and that_ in it_ he fought against him: __It was his hand that overthrew me; it is in his net that I am enclosed; and therefore you need not appear against me thus. I have enough to do to grapple with God's displeasure; let me not have yours also. Let God's controversy with me be ended before you begin yours.__ It is barbarous to persecute him whom God hath smitten and to talk to the grief of one whom he hath wounded_ Ps. lxix,20250223
That God would grant him some ease. If he could not prevail for the removal of his trouble_ yet might he not have some intermission? __Lord_ let me not be always upon the rack_ always in extremity: O let me alone_ that I may take comfort a little! v,20250223
That God would not overpower him_ that he would not deal with him either by absolute sovereignty or in strict justice_ not with a high hand_ nor with a strong hand: Will he plead against me with his great power? No. Job's friends pleaded against him with all the power they had; but will God do so? No; his power is all just and holy_ whatever men's is. Against those that are obstinate in their unbelief and impenitency God will plead with his great power; their destruction will come from the glory of his power. But with his own people_ that love him and trust in him_ he will deal in tender compassion,20250223
That God would see his affliction (v. take cognizance of his case_ and take it into his compassionate consideration. Thus David prays (Ps. xxv.,20250223
That God's cause suffered by such management. Under pretence of justifying God in afflicting Job they magisterially condemned him as a hypocrite and a bad man. __This__ (says he) __is speaking wickedly__ (for uncharitableness and censoriousness are wickedness_ great wickedness; it is an offence to God to wrong our brethren); __it is talking deceitfully_ for you condemn one whom yet perhaps your own consciences_ at the same time_ cannot but acquit. Your principles are false and your arguings fallacious_ and will it excuse you to say_ It is for God?__ No_ for a good intention will not justify_ much less will it sanctify_ a bad word or action. God's truth needs not our lie_ nor God's cause either our sinful policies or our sinful passions. The wrath of man works not the righteousness of God_ nor may we do evil that good may come_ Rom. iii. 7_ 8. Pious frauds (as they call them) are impious cheats; and devout persecutions are horrid profanations of the name of God_ as theirs who hated their brethren_ and cast them out_ saying_ Let the Lord be glorified_ Isa. lxvi. 5; John xvi. 2.,20250223
That God's nature infinitely exceeds the capacities of our understandings: __Canst thou find out God_ find him out to perfection? No_ What canst thou do? What canst thou know?__ v. 7_ 8. Thou_ a poor_ weak_ short-sighted creature_ a worm of the earth_ that art but of yesterday? Thou_ though ever so inquisitive after him_ ever so desirous and industrious to find him out_ yet darest thou attempt the search_ or canst thou hope to speed in it? We may_ by searching find God (Acts xvii. but we cannot find him out in any thing he is pleased to conceal; we may apprehend him_ but we cannot comprehend him; we may know that he is_ but cannot know what he is. The eye can see the ocean but not see over it. We may_ by a humble_ diligent_ and believing search_ find out something of God_ but cannot find him out to perfection; we may know_ but cannot know fully_ what God is_ nor find out his work from the beginning to the end_ Eccl. iii,20250223
That God's providence often crosses the fairest and most hopeful probabilities of men's endeavour_ and great calamities often surprise men ere they are aware_ ver. 11_ 12.,20250223
That God's way was the way he walked in (v. 11): __My foot hath held his steps___ that is_ __held to them_ adhered closely to them; the steps he takes. I have endeavoured to conform myself to his example.__ Good people are followers of God. Or_ __I have accommodated myself to his providence_ and endeavoured to answer all the intentions of that_ to follow Providence step by step.__ Or_ __His steps are the steps he has appointed me to take; the way of religion and serious godliness—that way I have kept_ and have not declined from it_ not only not turned back from it by a total apostasy_ but not turned aside out of it by any wilful transgression.__ His holding God's steps_ and keeping his way_ intimate that the tempter had used all his arts by fraud and force to draw him aside; but_ with care and resolution_ he had by the grace of God hitherto persevered_ and those that will do so must hold and keep_ hold with resolution and keep with watchfulness.,20250223
That God's word was the rule he walked by_ v,20250223
That Heaven might frown upon it: Let not God regard it from above_ v,20250223
That a heart to do thus is such a gift of God's grace as crowns all the gifts of his providence. If God has given a man riches and wealth_ he completes the favour_ and makes that a blessing indeed_ if withal he gives him power to eat thereof_ wisdom and grace to take the good of it and to do good with it. If this is God's gift_ we must covet it earnestly as the best gift relating to our enjoyments in this world. ,20250223
That a man is never the nearer to true happiness for the abundance that he has in this world: What is man the better for his wealth and pleasure_ his honour and preferment? What remains to man? What residuum has he_ what overplus_ what real advantage_ when he comes to balance his accounts? Nothing that will do him any good or turn to account. ,20250223
That all curses might follow it (v. 8): __Let none ever desire to see it_ or bid it welcome when it comes_ but_ on the contrary_ let those curse it that curse the day. Whatever day any are tempted to curse_ let them at the same time bestow one curse upon my birth-day_ particularly those that make it their trade to raise up mourning at funerals with their ditties of lamentation. Let those that curse the day of the death of others in the same breath curse the day of my birth.__ Or those who are so fierce and daring as to be ready to raise up the Leviathan (for that is the word here)_ who_ being about to strike the whale or crocodile_ curse it with the bitterest curse they can invent_ hoping by their incantations to weaken it_ and so to make themselves master of it. Probably some such custom might there be used_ to which our divine poet alludes. __Let it be as odious as the day wherein men bewail the greatest misfortune_ or the time wherein they see the most dreadful apparition;__ so bishop Patrick_ I suppose taking the Leviathan here to signify the devil_ as others do_ who understand it of the curses used by conjurors and magicians in raising the devil_ or when they have raised a devil that they cannot lay.,20250223
That all he does is according to the counsel of his will (v. 14): He performs the thing that is appointed for me. Whatever happens to us_ it is God that performs it (Ps. lvii. and an admirable performance the whole will appear to be when the mystery of God shall be finished. He performs all that_ and that only_ which was appointed_ and in the appointed time and method. This may silence us_ for what is appointed cannot be altered. But to consider that_ when God was appointing us to eternal life and glory as our end_ he was appointing to this condition_ this affliction_ whatever it is_ in our way_ this may do more than silence us_ it may satisfy us that it is all for the best; though what he does we know not now_ yet we shall know hereafter,20250223
That all he does is according to the custom of his providence: Many such things are with him_ that is_ He does many things in the course of his providence which we can give no account of_ but must resolve into his absolute sovereignty. Whatever trouble we are in others have been in the like. Our case is not singular; the same afflictions are accomplished in our brethren_ 1 Pet. v,20250223
That all is done by determination and with design we are sure; but what is determined_ and what designed_ and when the plan was laid_ we know not. God often causes the light of his cloud to shine_ in the rainbow (so some)_ in the lightning (so others); but did we foresee_ or could we foretel_ when he would to it? If we foresee the change of weather a few hours before_ by vulgar observation_ or when second causes have begun to work by the weather-glass_ yet how little do these show us of the purposes of God by these changes! ,20250223
That all joy might forsake it: __Let it be a melancholy night_ solitary_ and not a merry night of music and dancing. Let no joyful voice come therein (v. 7); let it be a long night_ and not see the eye-lids of the morning (v. which bring joy with them.__,20250223
That all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation_ 2 Pet. iii,20250223
That between him and us there is an infinite distance: God is in heaven_ where he reigns in glory over us and all the children of men_ where he is attended with an innumerable company of holy angels and is far exalted above all our blessing and praise. We are on earth_ the footstool of his throne; we are mean and vile_ unlike God_ and utterly unworthy to receive any favour from him or to have any communion with him. Therefore we must be very grave_ humble_ and serious_ and be reverent in speaking to him_ as we are when we speak to a great man that is much our superior; and_ in token of this_ let our words be few_ that they may be well chosen_ Job ix,20250223
That blessing can make very rich and sometimes makes good people so. Those that become rich by getting think they can easily make themselves very rich by saving; but_ as those that have little must depend upon God to make it much_ so those that have much must depend upon God to make it more and to double it; else you have sown much and bring in little_ Hag. i. 6,20250223
That both he himself and many others had very closely studied the point_ and searched far into the reasons of the prosperity of the wicked and the afflictions of the righteous. He_ for his part_ had applied his heart to know this wisdom_ and to see the business that is done_ by the divine Providence_ upon the earth_ to find out if there were any certain scheme_ any constant rule or method_ by which the affairs of this lower world were administered_ any course of government as sure and steady as the course of nature_ so that by what is done now we might as certainly foretel what will be done next as by the moon's changing now we can foretel when it will be at the full; this he would fain have found out. Others had likewise set themselves to make this enquiry with so close an application that they could not find time for sleep_ either day or night_ nor find in their hearts to sleep_ so full of anxiety were they about these things. Some think Solomon speaks of himself_ that he was so eager in prosecuting this great enquiry that he could not sleep for thinking of it,20250223
That children will discover themselves. One may soon see what their temper is_ and which way their inclination leads them_ according as their constitution is. Children have not learned the art of dissembling and concealing their bent as grown people have,20250223
That confederacies in sin shall certainly be broken_ and shall not avail to protect the sinners: Though hand join in hand_ though there are many that concur by their practice to keep wickedness in countenance_ and engage to stand by one another in defending it against all the attacks of virtue and justice_—though they are in league for the support and propagation of it_—though wicked children tread in the steps of their wicked parents_ and resolve to keep up the trade_ in defiance of religion_—yet all this will not protect them from the justice of God; they shall not be held guiltless; it will not excuse them to say that they did as the most did and as their company did; they shall not be unpunished; witness the flood that was brought upon a whole world of ungodly men. Their number_ and strength_ and unanimity in sin will stand them in no stead when the day of vengeance comes,20250223
That correction is necessary to the cure of it. It will not be got out by fair means and gentle methods; there must be strictness and severity_ and that which will cause grief. Children need to be corrected_ and kept under discipline_ by their parents; and we all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father (Heb. xii. 6_ and under the correction we must stroke down folly and kiss the rod.,20250223
That daring threatening sinners are confounded: Iniquity stops her mouth_ being surprised at the strangeness of the deliverance_ ashamed of its enmity against those who appear to be the favourites of Heaven_ mortified at the disappointment_ and compelled to acknowledge the justice of God's proceedings_ having nothing to object against them. Those that domineered over God's poor_ that frightened them_ menaced them_ and falsely accused them_ will not have a word to say against them when God appears for them. See Ps. lxxvi. 8_ 9; Isa. xxvi. 11; Mic. vii. 16.,20250223
That death and its darkness were very near and would be very long (v. 21_ 22): __Lord_ give me some ease before I die___ that is_ __lest I die of my pain.__ Thus David pleads (Ps. xiii.,20250223
That death puts a final period to all our employments and enjoyments in this world (ver. 4-6)_ whence he infers that it is our wisdom to enjoy the comforts of life and mind the business of life_ while it lasts_ ver. 7-10.,20250223
That destroyer_ though he deceives us_ cannot evade or elude the divine cognizance. God examines him whence he comes (Job i. and sees through all his disguises though he is sly_ and subtle_ and swift_ Job xxvi. 6,20250223
That earth might forget it: Let it perish (v. 3); let it not be joined to the days of the year_,20250223
That entails of religion shall certainly be blessed: The seed of the righteous_ that follow the steps of their righteousness_ though they may fall into trouble_ shall_ in due time_ be delivered. Though justice may come slowly to punish the wicked_ and mercy may come slowly to save the righteous_ yet both will come surely. Sometimes the seed of the righteous_ though they are not themselves righteous_ are delivered for the sake of their godly ancestors_ as Israel often_ and the seed of David.,20250223
That even good words will turn to a good account (v. 14): A man shall be satisfied with good (that is_ he shall gain present comfort_ that inward pleasure which is truly satisfying) by the fruit of his mouth_ by the good he does with his pious discourse and prudent advice. While we are teaching others we may ourselves learn_ and feed on the bread of life we break to others,20250223
That even in times of common calamity and danger he should have abundance of joy and hope (v. 29): __When men are cast down round about thee_ cast down in their affairs_ cast down in their spirits_ sinking_ desponding_ and ready to despair_ then shalt thou say_ There is lifting up. Thou shalt find that in thyself which will not only bear thee up under thy troubles_ and keep thee from fainting_ but lift thee up above thy troubles and enable thee to rejoice evermore.__ When men's hearts fail them for fear_ then shall Christ's disciples lift up their heads for joy_ Luke xxi. 26-28. Thus are they made to ride upon the high places of the earth (Isa. lviii. and that which will lift them up is the belief of this_ that God will save the humble person. Those that humble themselves shall be exalted_ not only in honour_ but in comfort.,20250223
That every change concerning us_ with the time and season of it_ is unalterably fixed and determined by a supreme power; and we must take things as they come_ for it is not in our power to change what is appointed for us. And this comes in here as a reason why_ when we are in prosperity_ we should by easy_ and yet not secure—not to be secure because we live in a world of changes and therefore have no reason to say_ To-morrow shall be as this day (the lowest valleys join to the highest mountains)_ and yet to be easy_ and_ as he had advised (ch. ii. to enjoy the good of our labour_ in a humble dependence upon God and his providence_ neither lifted up with hopes_ nor cast down with fears_ but with evenness of mind expecting every event. Here we have_,20250223
That every man shall draw after us. As there is a plain track before_ so there is a long train behind; we are neither the first nor the last that pass through that dark entry. Every one must go in his own order_ the order appointed of God.,20250223
That good men do well for themselves; for they have in themselves an excellent character_ and they secure to themselves an excellent portion_ and in both they excel other people: The righteous is more abundant than his neighbour (so the margin); he is richer_ though not in this world's goods_ yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit_ which are the true riches. There is a true excellency in religion; it ennobles men_ inspires them with generous principles_ makes them substantial; it is an excellency which is_ in the sight of God_ of great price_ who is the true Judge of excellency. His neighbour may make a greater figure in the world_ may be more applauded_ but the righteous man has the intrinsic worth,20250223
That good works_ much more_ will be abundantly rewarded: The recompence of a man's hands for all his work and labour of love_ all he has done for the glory of God and the good of his generation_ shall be rendered unto him_ and he shall reap as he has sown. Or it may be understood of the general rule of justice; God will render to every man according to his work_ Rom. ii. 6.,20250223
That has need to be often said which men are so loth to believe.,20250223
That he also looked upon it as a great aggravation of his sin that he had such a father_ who had given him a good education and put up many a good prayer for him; it cuts him to the heart to think that he should be a blemish and disgrace to the name and family of such a one as David. It aggravated the sin of Jehoiakim that he was the son of Josiah_ Jer. xxii. 15-17. ,20250223
That he and his children had suffered justly_ ver. 3_ 4.,20250223
That he could never fight it out with him_ nor carry his cause by force of arms. Sometimes_ among men_ controversies have been decided by battle_ and the victorious champion is adjudged to have justice on his side; but_ if the controversy were put upon that issue between God and man_ man would certainly go by the worse_ for all the forces he could raise against the Almighty would be but like briers and thorns before a consuming fire_ Isa. xxvii,20250223
That he could never talk it out with him_ nor carry his cause by noise and big words_ which sometimes among men go a great way towards the gaining of a point: __Canst thou thunder with a voice like him? No; his voice will soon drown thine and one of his thunders will overpower and overrule all thy whispers.__ Man cannot speak so convincingly_ so powerfully_ nor with such a commanding conquering force as God can_ who speaks_ and it is done. his creating voice is called his thunder (Ps. civ. so is that voice of his with which he terrifies and discomfits his enemies_ 1 Sam. ii,20250223
That he could not find out the cause of his troubles_ nor the sin which provoked God to contend with him. He took a view of his whole conversation_ turned to every side of it_ and could not perceive wherein he had sinned more than others_ for which he should thus be punished more than others; nor could he discern what other end God should aim at in afflicting him thus,20250223
That he could not foresee what would be in the end hereof_ whether God would deliver him at all_ nor_ if he did_ when or which way. He saw not his signs_ nor was there any to tell him how long; as the church complains_ Ps. lxxiv,20250223
That he could not have him served up to his table; he and his companions could not make a banquet of him; his flesh is too strong to be fit for food_ and_ if it were not_ he is not easily caught,20250223
That he could not make him his prisoner_ nor force him to cry for quarter_ or surrender himself at discretion_ v. 3_ 4. __He knows his own strength too well to make many supplications to thee_ and to make a covenant with thee to be thy servant on condition thou wilt save his life.__ 3. That he could not entice him into a cage_ and keep him there as a bird for the children to play with_ v,20250223
That he could not obtain any hope of the redress of his grievances_ v,20250223
That he did not rightly understand himself_ but had talked foolishly_ v,20250223
That he does well for himself. He has a certain rule_ which with an even steady hand he governs himself by: He walks in his integrity; he keeps good conscience_ and he has the comfort of it_ for it is his rejoicing. He is not liable to those uneasinesses_ either in contriving what he shall do or reflecting on what he has done_ which those are liable to that walk in deceit,20250223
That he does well for his family: His children are blessed after him_ and fare the better for his sake. God has mercy in store for the seed of the faithful.,20250223
That he had a God to go to_ with whom he could lodge his appeal; for some understand those words of the person mocked_ that he calls upon God and he answers him; and so it agrees with ch. xvi,20250223
That he had a good cause_ and a noble and very fruitful subject: I have yet to speak on God's behalf. He spoke as an advocate for God_ and therefore might justly expect the ear of the court. Some indeed pretend to speak on God's behalf who really speak for themselves; but those who sincerely appear in the cause of God_ and speak in behalf of his honour_ his truths_ his ways_ his people_ shall be sure neither to want instructions (it shall be given them in that same hour what they shall speak) nor to lose their cause or their fee. Nor need they fear lest they should exhaust their subject. Those that have spoken ever so much may yet find more to be spoken on God's behalf,20250223
That he had a great deal to say: __I am full of matter_ having carefully attended to all that has hitherto been said_ and made my own reflections upon it.__ When aged men are drawn dry_ and have spent their stock_ in discoursing of the divine Providence_ God can raise up others_ even young men_ and fill them with matter for the edifying of his church; for it is a subject that can never be exhausted_ though those that speak upon it may. ,20250223
That he had a very great tenderness for his servants and ruled them with a gentle hand. He had a great household and he managed it well. By this he evidenced his sincerity that he had grace to govern his passion as well as his appetite; and he that in these two things has the rule of his own spirit is better than the mighty_ Prov. xvi,20250223
That he had been cruel and unmerciful to the poor. As a magistrate he ought to have protected them and seen them provided for; but Eliphaz suspects that he never did them any kindness_ but all the mischief his power enabled him to do_—that_ for an inconsiderable debt_ he demanded_ and carried away by violence_ a pawn of great value_ even from his brother_ whose honesty and sufficiency he could not but know (v.,20250223
That he had been partial to the rich and great (v. 8): __As for the mighty man_ if he was guilty of any crime_ he was never questioned for it: he had the earth; he dwelt in it. If he brought an action ever so unjustly_ or if an action were ever so justly brought against him_ yet he was sure to carry his cause in thy courts. The poor were not fed at thy door_ while the rich were feasted at thy table.__ Contrary to this is Christ's rule for hospitality (Luke xiv. 12-14); and Solomon says_ He that gives to the rich shall come to poverty.,20250223
That he had comfort in his family. Every thing was agreeable there: he had both mouths for his meat and meat for his mouths; the want of either is a great affliction. 1. He had a numerous offspring to enjoy his estate: My children were about me. He had many children_ enough to compass him round_ and they were observant of him and obsequious to him; they were about him_ to know what he would have and wherein they might serve him. It is a comfort to tender parents to see their children about them. Job speaks very feelingly of this comfort now that he was deprived of it. He thought it an instance of God's being with him that his children were about him; and yet reckon amiss if_ when we have lost our children_ we cannot comfort ourselves with this_ that we have not lost our God,20250223
That he had divested himself of all his honour_ and all his comfort_ in compliance with the afflicting providences that surrounded him. Some can lessen their own troubles by concealing them_ holding their heads as high and putting on as good a face as ever; but Job could not do so: he received the impressions of them_ and_ as one truly penitent and truly patient_ he humbled himself under the mighty hand of God_ v. 15_ 16. 1. He now laid aside all his ornaments and soft clothing_ consulted not either his ease or finery in his dress_ but sewed sackcloth upon his skin; that clothing he thought good enough for such a defiled distempered body as he had. Silks upon sores_ such sores_ he thought_ would be unsuitable; sackcloth would be more becoming. Those are fond indeed of gay clothing that will not be weaned from it by sickness and old age_ and_ as Job was (v. by wrinkles and leanness. He not only put on sackcloth_ but sewed it on_ as one that resolved to continue his humiliation as long as the affliction continued,20250223
That he had done God no service by it_ nor made him in the least beholden to him. It is indeed our duty_ and will be our honour_ to speak on God's behalf; but we must not think that he needs our service_ or is indebted to us for it_ nor will he accept it if it come from a spirit of contention and contradiction_ and not from a sincere regard to God's glory,20250223
That he had done him no service by it. He pretended to convince_ instruct_ and comfort_ Job; but_ alas! what he had said was so little to the purpose that it would not avail to rectify any mistakes_ nor to assist him either in bearing his afflictions or in getting good by them: __To whom has thou uttered words? v,20250223
That he had done his cause no service by it. He thought his friends were mightily beholden to him for helping them_ at a dead lift_ to make their part good against Job_ when they were quite at a loss_ and had no strength_ no wisdom. Even weak disputants_ when warm_ are apt to think truth more beholden to them than it really is,20250223
That he had no intermission of his griefs (v. 19): __How long will it be ere thou cause thy rod to depart from me_ or abate the rigour of the correction_ at least for so long as that I may swallow down my spittle?__ It should seem_ Job's distemper lay much in his throat_ and almost choked him_ so that he could not swallow his spittle. He complains (ch. xxx. 18) that it bound him about like the collar of his coat. __Lord___ says he_ __wilt not thou give me some respite_ some breathing time?__ ch. ix. 18.,20250223
That he had no reason to desire any such thing: __What is my end_ that I should desire to prolong my life? What comfort can I promise myself in life_ comparable to the comfort I promise myself in death?__ Note_ Those who_ through grace_ are ready for another world_ cannot see much to invite their stay in this world_ or to make them fond of it. That_ if it be God's will_ we may do him more service and may get to be fitter and riper for heaven_ is an end for which we may wish the prolonging of life_ in subservience to our chief end; but_ otherwise_ what can we propose to ourselves in desiring to tarry here? The longer life is the more grievous will its burdens be (Eccl. xii. 1)_ and the longer life is the less pleasant will be its delights_ 2 Sam. xix. 34_ 35. We have already seen the best of this world_ but we are not sure that we have seen the worst of it.,20250223
That he had no reason to expect any such thing: __What is my strength_ that I should hope? You see how I am weakened and brought low_ how unable I am to grapple with my distempers_ and therefore what reason have I to hope that I should out-live them_ and see better days? Is my strength the strength of stones? Are my muscles brass and my sinews steel? No_ they are not_ and therefore I cannot hold out always in this pain and misery_ but must needs sink under the load. Had I strength to grapple with my distemper_ I might hope to look through it; but_ alas! I have not. The weakening of my strength in the way will certainly be the shortening of my days___ Ps. cii,20250223
That he had no share at all in the first making of the world (v. 18): __Hast thou with him spread out the sky? Thou canst not pretend to have stretched it out without him_ no_ nor to have stretched it out in conjunction with him; for he was far from needing any help either in contriving or in working.__ The creation of the vast expanse of the visible heavens (Gen. i. 6-8)_ which we see in being to this day_ is a glorious instance of the divine power_ considering,20250223
That he had not a due regard to God_ but had talked wickedly. If what he had said be tried to the end_ that is_ if one put it to the utmost stretch and make the worst of it_ it will be found_ First_ That he has taken part with God's enemies: His answers have been for wicked men; that is_ what he had said tended to strengthen the hands and harden the hearts of wicked people in their wickedness_ he having carried the matter of their prosperity much further than he needed. Let wicked men_ like Baal_ plead for themselves if they will_ but far be it from us that we should answer for them_ or say any thing in favour of them. Secondly_ That he has insulted God's friends_ and hectored over them: __He clappeth his hands among us; and_ if he be not thoroughly tried and humbled_ will grow yet more insolent and imperious_ as if he had gotten the day and silenced us all.__ To speak ill is bad enough_ but to clap our hands and triumph in it when we have done_ as if error and passion had won the victory_ is much worse. Thirdly_ That he has spoken against God himself_ and_ by standing to what he had said_ added rebellion to his sin. To speak_ though but one word_ against God_ by whom we speak and for whom we ought to speak_ is a great sin; what is it then to multiply words against him_ as if we would out-talk him? What is it to repeat them_ instead of unsaying them? Those that have sinned_ and_ when they are called to repent_ thus go on frowardly_ add rebellion to their sin and make it exceedingly sinful. Errare possum_ Hæreticus esse nolo—I may fall into error_ but I will not plunge into heresy.,20250223
That he had often wished for one that would appear for God_ with whom he might freely expostulate_ and to whom_ as arbitrator_ he might refer the matter_ and such a one Elihu would be (v. 6): I am_ according to thy wish_ in God's stead. How pathetically had Job wished (ch. xvi.,20250223
That he had patiently heard all they had to say_ ver. 11-13,20250223
That he had something new to offer_ ver. 14-17,20250223
That he had something to offer that was uncommon_ and out of the road of vulgar observation: I will fetch my knowledge from afar (v.,20250223
That he had spoken too passionately_ ver. 2.,20250223
That he had the authority of a commander or general. He dwelt as a king in the army_ giving orders which were not to be disputed. Every one that has the spirit of wisdom has not the spirit of government_ but Job had both_ and_ when there was occasion_ could assume state_ as the king in the army does_ and say_ __Go___ __Come___ and __Do this___ Matt. viii,20250223
That he has a great deal of strength and spirit (v. 19): Hast thou given the horse strength? He uses his strength for man_ but has it not from him: God gave it to him_ who is the fountain of all the powers of nature_ and yet he himself delights not in the strength of the horse (Ps. cxlvii. but has told us that a horse is a vain thing for safety_ Ps. xxxiii,20250223
That he has every thing in him that is lovely and amiable: My beloved is white and ruddy_ the colours that make up a complete beauty. This points not at any extraordinary beauty of his body_ when he should be incarnate (it was never said of the child Jesus_ as of the child Moses_ when he was born_ that he was exceedingly fair_ Acts vii. 20; nay_ he had no form nor comeliness_ Isa. liii. 2); but his divine glory_ and the concurrence of every thing in him as Mediator_ to make him truly lovely in the eyes of those that are enlightened to discern spiritual things. In him we may behold the beauty of the Lord; he was the holy child Jesus; that was his fairness. If we look upon him as made to us wisdom_ righteousness_ sanctification_ and redemption_ he appears_ in all_ very amiable. His love to us renders him lovely. He is white in the spotless innocency of his life_ ruddy in the bloody sufferings he went through at his death_—white in his glory_ as God (when he was transfigured his raiment was white as the light)_ ruddy in his assuming the nature of man_ Adam—red earth_—white in his tenderness towards his people_ ruddy in his terrible appearances against his and their enemies. His complexion is a very happy composition. ,20250223
That he has forsaken the poor_ taken no care of them_ shown no kindness to them_ nor made any provision for them. At first perhaps_ for a pretence_ he gave alms like the Pharisees_ to gain a reputation; but_ when he had served his turn by this practice_ he left it off_ and forsook the poor_ whom before he seemed to be concerned for. Those who do good_ but not from a good principle_ though they may abound in it_ will not abide in it. (2.),20250223
That he has oppressed them_ crushed them_ taken all advantages against them to do them a mischief. To enrich himself_ he has robbed the spital_ and made the poor poorer. ,20250223
That he has that loveliness in him which is not to be found in any other: He is the chief among ten thousand_ a nonsuch for beauty_ fairer than the children of men_ than any of them_ than all of them; there is none like him_ nor any to be compared with him; every thing else is to be accounted loss and dung in comparison of him_ Phil. iii,20250223
That he has the comfort of communion with God. He shall now see the face of God_ which before was hid from him_ and he shall see it with joy_ for what sight can be more reviving? See Gen. xxxiii. 10_ As though I had seen the face of God. All true penitents rejoice more in the returns of God's favour than in any instance whatsoever of prosperity or pleasure_ Ps. iv. 6_ 7. ,20250223
That he has violently taken away their houses_ which he had no right to_ as Ahab took Naboth's vineyard_ not by secret fraud_ by forgery_ perjury_ or some trick in law_ but avowedly_ and by open violence.,20250223
That he intended to make a solemn business of it_ not to put in a word by the by_ or give a short repartee_ to show his wit: after long silence he opened his mouth (v. with deliberation and design. Upon mature consideration he had already begun to speak_ and was prepared to go on if Job would encourage him by his attention,20250223
That he is a king over all the children of pride_ that is_ he is the proudest of all proud ones. He has more to be proud of (so Mr. Caryl expounds it) than the proudest people in the world have; and so it is a mortification to the haughtiness and lofty looks of men. Whatever bodily accomplishments men are proud of_ and puffed up with_ the leviathan excels them and is a king over them. Some read it so as to understand it of God: He that beholds all high things_ even he_ is King over all the children of pride; he can tame the behemoth (ch. xl. 19) and the leviathan_ big as they are_ and stout-hearted as they are. This discourse concerning those two animals was brought in to prove that it is God only who can look upon proud men and abase them_ bring them low and tread them down_ and hide them in the dust (ch. xl. 11-13)_ and so it concludes with a quod erat demonstrandum—which was to be demonstrated; there is one that beholds all high things_ and_ wherein men deal proudly_ is above them; he is King over all the children of pride_ whether brutal or rational_ and can make them all either bend or break before him_ Isa. ii,20250223
That he is a non-such among the inferior creatures: Upon earth there is not his like_ v,20250223
That he is an incomparable teacher: Who teaches like him? It is absurd for us to teach him who is himself the fountain of light_ truth_ knowledge_ and instruction. He that teaches man knowledge_ and so as none else can_ shall not he know? Ps. xciv. 9_ 10. Shall we light a candle to the sun? Observe_ When Elihu would give glory to God as a ruler he praises him as a teacher_ for rulers must teach. God does so. He binds with the cords of a man. In this_ as in other things_ he is unequalled. None so fit to direct his own actions as he himself is. He knows what he has to do_ and how to do it for the best_ and needs no information nor advice. Solomon himself had a privy-council to advise him_ but the King of kings has none. Nor is any so fit to direct our actions as he is. None teaches with such authority and convincing evidence_ with such condescension and compassion_ nor with such power and efficacy_ as God does. He teaches by the Bible_ and that is the best book_ teaches by his Son_ and he is the best Master. ,20250223
That he is excellent in power. It is the excellency of his power that he can do whatever he pleases in heaven and earth. The universal extent and irresistible force of his power are the excellency of it; no creature has an arm like him_ so long_ so strong. ,20250223
That he is himself very proud; though lodged in the deep_ yet he beholds all high things_ v,20250223
That he is more bold and daring than any other creature whatsoever: He is made without fear. The creatures are as they are made; the leviathan has courage in his constitution_ nothing can frighten him; other creatures_ quite contrary_ seem as much designed for flying as this for fighting. So_ among men_ some are in their natural temper bold_ others are timorous. ,20250223
That he is not less excellent in wisdom and righteousness_ in judgment and plenty of justice_ else there would be little excellency in his power. We may be sure that he who can do every thing will do every thing for the best_ for he is infinitely wise_ and will not in any thing do wrong_ for he is infinitely just. When he executes judgment upon sinners_ yet there is plenty of justice in the execution_ and he inflicts not more than they deserve. ,20250223
That he is the rightful Lord and owner of all the creatures: __Whatsoever is under the whole heaven_ animate or inanimate_ is mine (and particularly this leviathan)_ at my command and disposal_ what I have an incontestable property in and dominion over.__ All is his; we are his_ all we have and do; and therefore we cannot make God our debtor; but of thy own_ Lord_ have we given thee. All is his_ and therefore_ if he were indebted to any_ he has wherewithal to repay them; the debt is in good hands. All is his_ and therefore he needs not our services_ nor can he be benefited by them. If I were hungry I would not tell thee_ for the world is mind and the fulness thereof_ Ps. l. 12.,20250223
That he is unexceptionably just in all his proceedings: Who can say_ Thou hast wrought iniquity? Not_ Who dares say it? (many do iniquity_ and those who tell them of it do so at their peril)_ but Who can say it? Who has any cause to say it? Who can say it and prove it? It is a maxim undoubtedly true_ without limitation_ that the King of kings can do no wrong.,20250223
That he is very fierce and furious in battle_ and charges with an undaunted courage_ though he pushes on in imminent danger of his life. ,20250223
That he looked upon it as a great honour to be the son of so good a man_ and valued himself very much upon it. ,20250223
That he might not have leisure to consider and recollect himself_ and reason himself into a gracious submission_ but might be overwhelmed and overpowered by a complication of calamities. If he have not room to pause a little_ he will be apt to speak in haste_ and then_ if ever_ he will curse his God. Note_ The children of God are often in heaviness through manifold temptations; deep calls to deep; waves and billows come one upon the neck of another. Let one affliction therefore quicken and help us to prepare for another; for_ how deep soever we have drunk of the bitter cup_ as long as we are in this world we cannot be sure that we have drunk our share and that it will finally pass from us.,20250223
That he never ate the fruits of it without money_ v,20250223
That he never caused the owners thereof to lose their life_ never got an estate_ as Ahab got Naboth's vineyard_ by killing the heir and seizing the inheritance_ never starved those that held lands of him nor killed them with hard bargains and hard usage. No tenant_ no workman_ no servant_ he had_ could complain of him.,20250223
That he prosecuted those advantages to the utmost: Thou wilt not acquit me from my iniquity. While his troubles he could not take the comfort of his pardon_ nor hear that voice of joy and gladness; so hard is it to see love in God's heart when we see frowns in his face and a rod in his hand. ,20250223
That he shall be very rich (v. 24): __Thou shalt lay up gold as dust_ in such great abundance_ and shalt have plenty of silver (v. whereas now thou art poor and stripped of all.__ Job had been rich. Eliphaz suspected he got his riches by fraud and oppression_ and therefore they were taken from him: but if he would return to God and his duty_ ,20250223
That he should die in the same prosperous state in which he had lived. If such an expectation as this arise from a lively faith in the providence and promise of God_ it is well_ but if from a conceit of our own wisdom_ and the stability of these earthly things_ it is ill-grounded and turns into sin. We hope Job's confidence was like David's (Ps. xxvii. 1_ Whom shall I fear?)_ not like the rich fool's (Luke xii.,20250223
That he should have a humble holy confidence towards God_ such as those are said to have whose hearts condemn them not_ 1 John iii,20250223
That he should have inward satisfaction in the management of all his outward affairs (v.,20250223
That he should live a life of complacency in God (v. 26): __For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty; and thus the Almighty comes to be thy gold by thy delighting in him_ as worldly people delight in their money. He shall be thy wealth_ thy defence_ thy dignity; for he shall be thy delight.__ The way to have our heart's desire is to make God our heart's delight_ Ps. xxxvii.,20250223
That he should live long_ should multiply his days as the sand. He means as the sand on the sea-shore; whereas we should rather reckon our days by the sand in the hourglass_ which will have run out in a little time. See how apt even good people are to think of death as a thing at a distance_ and to put far from them that evil day_ which will really be to them a good day. ,20250223
That he should maintain a constant communion with God_ __The correspondence_ once settled_ shall be kept up to thy unspeakable satisfaction. Letters shall be both statedly and occasionally interchanged between thee and heaven___ v,20250223
That he takes great delight in that good work which his grace has wrought on the souls of believers; so that though they have their infirmities_ whatever they think of themselves_ and the world thinks of them_ he thinks them fair. He calls them friends. The hidden man of the heart_ in that which is not corruptible_ is in the sight of God of great price_ 1 Pet. iii. 4,20250223
That he was a burden to himself_ ready to sink under the load of his own life. How much delight soever we take in ourselves God can_ when he pleases_ make us burdens to ourselves. What comfort can we take in ourselves if God appear against us as an enemy and we have not comfort in him.,20250223
That he was a king_ and a king's son. The penmen of scripture_ hitherto_ were most of them men of the first rank in the world_ as Moses and Joshua_ Samuel and David_ and now Solomon; but_ after him_ the inspired writers were generally poor prophets_ men of no figure in the world_ because that dispensation was approaching in the which God would choose the weak and foolish things of the world to confound the wise and mighty and the poor should be employed to evangelize. Solomon was a very rich king_ and his dominions were very large_ a king of the first magnitude_ and yet he addicted himself to the study of divine things_ and was a prophet and a prophet's son. It is no disparagement to the greatest princes and potentates in the world to instruct those about them in religion and the laws of it,20250223
That he was a man who prospered greatly in this world_ and made a considerable figure in his country. He was prosperous and yet pious. Though it is hard and rare_ it is not impossible_ for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. With God even this is possible_ and by his grace the temptations of worldly wealth are not insuperable. He was pious_ and his piety was a friend to his prosperity; for godliness has the promise of the life that now is. He was prosperous_ and his prosperity put a lustre upon his piety_ and gave him who was so good so much greater opportunity of doing good. The acts of his piety were grateful returns to God for the instances of his prosperity; and_ in the abundance of the good things God gave him_ he served God the more cheerfully. 1. He had a numerous family. He was eminent for religion_ and yet not a hermit_ not a recluse_ but the father and master of a family. It was an instance of his prosperity that his house was filled with children_ which are a heritage of the Lord_ and his reward_ Ps. cxxvii,20250223
That he was a very good man_ eminently pious_ and better than his neighbours: He was perfect and upright. This is intended to show us_ not only what reputation he had among men (that he was generally taken for an honest man)_ but what was really his character; for it is the judgment of God concerning him_ and we are sure that is according to truth. 1. Job was a religious man_ one that feared God_ that is_ worshipped him according to his will_ and governed himself by the rules of the divine law in every thing,20250223
That he was fain_ when thou wast destitute_ To dig thee out of thy dark cave and grot.,20250223
That he was one who had his faults_ and in his latter end turned aside from those good ways of God which in this book he had directed others in. We have the story of it 1 Kings xi._ and a sad story it is_ that the penman of such a book as this should apostatize as he did. Tell it not in Gath. But let those who are most eminently useful take warning by this not to be proud or secure; and let us all learn not to think the worse of good instructions though we have them from those who do not themselves altogether live up to them.,20250223
That he was one whom God endued with extraordinary measures of wisdom and knowledge_ in answer to his prayers at his accession to the throne. His prayer was exemplary: Give me a wise and an understanding heart; the answer to it was encouraging: he had what he desired and all other things were added to him. Now here we find what good use he made of the wisdom God gave him; he not only governed himself and his kingdom with it_ but he gave rules of wisdom to others also_ and transmitted them to posterity. Thus must we trade with the talents with which we are entrusted_ according as they are,20250223
That he was resolved to speak as he thought and not otherwise (v. 3): __My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart_ the genuine product of my convictions and sentiments.__ There was reason to suspect that Job's three friends did not think_ in their consciences_ that Job was so bad a man as they had in their discourses_ merely for the support of their hypothesis_ represented him to be; and that was not fair. It is a base thing to condemn those with our tongues_ to serve a turn_ whom at the same time we cannot but in our consciences think well of. Elihu is an honest man_ and scorns to do so,20250223
That he was resolved to speak impartially_ ver. 21_ 22. And he did speak so well to this matter that Job made no reply to him_ and God gave him no rebuke when he checked both Job himself and his other three friends.,20250223
That he was the butt to God's arrows: __Thou hast set me as a mark against thee___ v,20250223
That he was under a necessity of saying it: __The spirit within me not only instructs me what to say_ but puts me on to say it; so that if I have not vent (such a ferment are my thoughts in) I shall burst like bottles of new wine when it is working___,20250223
That he will not afflict_ that is_ that he will not afflict willingly; it is no pleasure to him to grieve the children of men_ much less his own children. He never afflicts but when there is cause and when there is need_ and he does not overburden us with affliction_ but considers our frame. Some read it thus: __The Almighty_ whom we cannot find out_ is great in power_ but he will not afflict in judgment_ and with him is plenty of justice_ nor is he extreme to mark what we do amiss.__ ,20250223
That he wishes all about him would give him this counsel_ would prophesy to him such smooth things as these_ and cannot brook any advice to the contrary_ but reckons those his enemies that bid him be sober and serious. ,20250223
That he would adhere to this resolution as long as he lived (v. 3): All the while my breath is in me. Our resolutions against sin should be thus constant_ resolutions for life. In things doubtful and indifferent_ it is not safe to be thus peremptory. We know not what reason we may see to change our mind: God may reveal to us that which we now are not aware of. But in so plain a thing as this we cannot be too positive that we will never speak wickedness. Something of a reason for his resolution is here implied—that our breath will not be always in us. We must shortly breathe our last_ and therefore_ while our breath is in us_ we must never breathe wickedness and deceit_ nor allow ourselves to say or do any thing which will make against us when our breath shall depart. The breath in us is called the spirit of God_ because he breathed it into us; and this is another reason why we must not speak wickedness. It is God that gives us life and breath_ and therefore_ while we have breath_ we must praise him.,20250223
That he would be very willing to hear what Job could object against what he had to say (v. 5): __If thou canst_ answer me. If thou hast so much strength and spirit left thee_ and art not quite spent with the distemper and the dispute_ set thy words in order_ and they shall have their due consideration.__ Those that can speak reason will hear reason,20250223
That he would in due time clear up his innocency (v. 21): O that one might plead for a man with God! If he could but now have the same freedom at God's bar that men commonly have at the bar of the civil magistrate_ he doubted not but to carry his cause_ for the Judge himself was a witness to his integrity. The language of this wish is like that in Isa. l. 7_ 8_ I know that I shall not be ashamed_ for he is near that justifies me. Some give a gospel sense of this verse_ and the original will very well bear it; and he will plead (that is_ there is one that will plead) for man with God_ even the Son of man for his friend_ or neighbour. Those who pour out tears before God_ though they cannot plead for themselves_ by reason of their distance and defects_ have a friend to plead for them_ even the Son of man_ and on this we must bottom all our hopes of acceptance with God.,20250223
That he would_ in his discourse_ make the best use he could of the reason and understanding God had given him_ that life_ that rational soul which he received from the Spirit of God and the breath of the Almighty_ v,20250223
That he_ having returned to her_ kindly courted her return to him_ notwithstanding the discouragements she laboured under. Let her not despair of obtaining as much comfort as ever she had before this distance happened_ but take the comfort of the return of her beloved_ v,20250223
That his God was the author of his affliction_ ver. 8-12,20250223
That his being the son of David encouraged him to repent and hope for mercy_ for David had fallen into sin_ by which he should have been warned not to sin_ but was not; but David repented_ and therein he took example from him and found mercy as he did. Yet this was not all; he was that son of David concerning whom God had said that though he would chasten his transgression with the rod_ yet he would not break his covenant with him_ Ps. lxxxix,20250223
That his body was worn away with diseases and pains_ so that he had become a perfect skeleton_ nothing but skin and bones_ v,20250223
That his case was not singular_ but very common: The just upright man is laughed to scorn. By many he is laughed at even for his justice and his uprightness_ his honesty towards men and his piety towards God; these are derided as foolish things_ which silly people needlessly hamper themselves with_ as if religion were a jest and therefore to be made a jest of. By most he is laughed at for any little infirmity or weakness_ notwithstanding his justice and uprightness_ without any consideration had of that which is so much his honour. Note_ It was of old the lot of honest good people to be despised and derided; we are not therefore to think it strange (1 Pet. iv. no_ nor to think it hard_ if it be our lot; so persecuted they not only the prophets_ but even the saints of the patriarchal age (Matt. v. and can we expect to fare better than they?,20250223
That his conscience witnessed for him that_ in his prosperity_ he had sympathized with those that were in misery_ ver. 25.,20250223
That his design was undeniably honest; for all he aimed at was to ascribe righteousness to his Maker_ to maintain and clear this truth_ that God is righteous in all his ways. In speaking of God_ and speaking for him_ it is good to remember that he is our Maker_ to call him so_ and therefore to be ready to do him and the interests of his kingdom the best service we can. If he be our Maker_ we have our all from him_ must use our all for him_ and be very jealous for his honour. That his management should be very just and fair (v. 4): __My words shall not be false_ neither disagreeable to the thing itself nor to my own thoughts and apprehensions. It is truth that I am contending for_ and that for truth's sake_ with all possible sincerity and plainness.__ He will make use of plain and solid arguments and not the subtleties and niceties of the schools. __He who is perfect or upright in knowledge is now reasoning with thee; and therefore let him not only have a fair hearing_ but let what he says be taken in good part_ as meant well.__ The perfection of our knowledge in this world is to be honest and sincere in searching out truth_ in applying it to ourselves_ and in making use of what we know for the good of others.,20250223
That his enemy was a terror to him_ threatened him_ frightened him_ looked sternly upon him_ and gave all the indications of rage against him (v. 9): He tears me in his wrath. But who is this enemy? 1. Eliphaz_ who showed himself very much exasperated against him_ and perhaps had expressed himself with such marks of indignation as are here mentioned: at least_ what he said tore Job's good name and thundered nothing but terror to him; his eyes were sharpened to spy out matter of reproach against Job_ and very barbarously both he and the rest of them used him. Or_ 2. Satan. He was his enemy that hated him_ and perhaps_ by the divine permission_ terrified him with apparitions_ as (some think) he terrified our Saviour_ which put him into his agonies in the garden; and thus he aimed to make him curse God. It is not improbable that this is the enemy he means. Or_ ,20250223
That his mind might not be terrified with the tremendous majesty of God: __Let not thy dread make me afraid; either let the manifestations of thy presence be familiar or let me be enabled to bear them without disorder and disturbance.__ Moses himself trembled before God_ so did Isaiah and Habakkuk. O God! thou art terrible even in thy holy places. __Lord___ says Job_ __let me not be put into such a consternation of spirit_ together with this bodily affliction; for then I must certainly drop the cause_ and shall make nothing of it.__ See what a folly it is for men to put off their repentance and conversion to a sick-bed and a death-bed. How can even a good man_ much less a bad man_ reason with God_ so as to be justified before him_ when he is upon the rack of pain and under the terror of the arrests of death? At such a time it is very bad to have the great work to do_ but very comfortable to have it done_ as it was to Job_ who_ if he might but have a little breathing-time_ was ready either_ ,20250223
That his mind was full of this matter_ and it would be a refreshment to him to give it vent_ ver. 18-20,20250223
That his neck and nostrils look great. His neck is clothed with thunder_ with a large and flowing mane_ which makes him formidable and is an ornament to him. The glory of his nostrils_ when he snorts_ flings up his head_ and throws foam about_ is terrible_ v,20250223
That his own heart gave him a strong instigation. His thoughts caused him to answer (v. for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks; but he fathers the instigation (v. 3) upon the spirit of his understanding: that indeed should cause us to answer; we should rightly apprehend a thing and duly consider it before we speak of it; but whether it did so here or no is a question. Men often mistake the dictates of their passion for the dictates of their reason_ and therefore think they do well to be angry.,20250223
That his pleasures did not debauch his judgment and conscience. In the midst of these entertainments his wisdom remained with him_ v,20250223
That his power is irresistible: What his soul desires or designs even that he does_ and nothing can stand in his way or put him upon new counsels. Men desire many things which they may not do_ or cannot do_ or dare not do. But God has an incontestable sovereignty; his will is so perfectly pure and right that it is highly fit he should pursue all its determinations. And he has an uncontrollable power. None can stay his hand. Whatever the Lord pleased that did he (Ps. cxxxv. and always will_ for it is always best,20250223
That his relations and friends were strange to him_ and shy of him_ in his affliction_ ver. 20-22.,20250223
That his trouble was very great. He was overthrown_ and could not help himself_ enclosed as in a net_ and could not get out. ,20250223
That if he had not yet seen an end of his troubles_ the reason was because he did not thus trust in God and wait for him (v. 15): __Because it is not so_ because thou dost not thus trust in him_ therefore the affliction which came at first from love has now displeasure mixed with it. Now God has visited thee in his anger_ taking it very ill that thou canst not find in thy heart to trust him_ but harbourest such hard misgiving thoughts of him.__ If there be any mixtures of divine wrath in our afflictions_ we may thank ourselves; it is because we do not behave aright under them; we quarrel with God_ and are fretful and impatient_ and distrustful of the divine Providence. This was Job's case. The foolishness of man perverts his way_ and then his heart frets against the Lord_ Prov. xix,20250223
That impenitent sinners will certainly be punished in the other world_ and_ usually_ their punishment is put off until then. ,20250223
That is,20250223
That is a day we are concerned to think of every day. ,20250223
That is a faint resemblance of the universal cognizance and care God takes of the whole creation_ Matt. v,20250223
That is best for us which is best for our souls_ by which the heart is made better_ though it be unpleasing to sense,20250223
That is the method of a blessed recovery. Son_ be of good cheer_ thy sins be forgiven thee; and then_ Rise_ take up thy bed_ and walk_ Matt. ix. 2_ 6. So here_ interest him in the ransom_ and then his flesh shall be fresher than a child's and there shall be no remains of his distemper_ but he shall return to the days of his youth_ to the beauty and strength which he had then. When the distemper that oppressed nature is removed how strangely does nature help itself_ in which the power and goodness of the God of nature must be thankfully acknowledged! By such merciful providences as these_ which afflictions give occasion for_ God speaketh once_ yea_ twice_ to the children of men_ letting them know (if they would but perceive it) their dependence upon him and his tender compassion of them,20250223
That is was a very great change in his condition (v.,20250223
That is was through the wickedness of his neighbours the Sabeans_ probably a sort of robbers that lived by spoil and plunder. They carried off the oxen and asses_ and slew the servants that faithfully and bravely did their best to defend them_ and one only escaped_ not in kindness to him or his master_ but that Job might have the certain intelligence of it by an eye-witness before he heard it by a flying report_ which would have brought it upon him gradually. We have no reason to suspect that either Job or his servants had given any provocation to the Sabeans to make this inroad_ but Satan put it into their hearts to do it_ to do it now_ and so gained a double point_ for he made both Job to suffer and them to sin. Note_ When Satan has God's permission to do mischief he will not want mischievous men to be his instruments in doing it_ for he is a spirit that works in the children of disobedience.,20250223
That is_  He is acquainted with it. His friends judged of that which they did not know_ and therefore charged him with that which he was never guilty of; but God_ who knew every step he had taken_ would not do so_ Ps. cxxxix,20250223
That it infinitely exceeds the limits of the whole creation: It is higher than heaven (so some read it)_ deeper than hell_ the great abyss_ longer than the earth_ and broader than the sea_ many parts of which are to this day undiscovered_ and more were then. It is quite out of our reach to comprehend God's nature. Such knowledge is too wonderful for us_ Ps. cxxxix,20250223
That it is a divine correction; it is the chastening of the Lord_ which_ as it is a reason why we should submit to it (for it is folly to contend with a God of incontestable sovereignty and irresistible power)_ so it is a reason why we should be satisfied in it; for we may be sure that a God of unspotted purity does us no wrong and that a God of infinite goodness means us no hurt. It is from God_ and therefore must not be despised; for a slight put upon the messenger is an affront to him that sends him. It is from God_ and therefore we must not be weary of it_ for he knows our frame_ both what we need and what we can bear. ,20250223
That it is a fatherly correction; it comes not from his vindictive justice as a Judge_ but his wise affection as a Father. The father corrects the son whom he loves_ nay_ and because he loves him and desires he may be wise and good. He delights in that in his son which is amiable and agreeable_ and therefore corrects him for the prevention and cure of that which would be a deformity to him_ and an alloy to his delight in him. Thus God hath said_ As many as I love I rebuke and chasten_ Rev. iii,20250223
That it is a penitential sermon_ as some of David's psalms are penitential psalms; it is a recantation-sermon_ in which the preacher sadly laments his own folly and mistake_ in promising himself satisfaction in the things of this world_ and even in the forbidden pleasures of sense_ which now he finds more bitter than death. His fall is a proof of the weakness of man's nature: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom_ nor say_ __I shall never be such a fool as to do so and so___ when Solomon himself_ the wisest of men_ played the fool so egregiously; nor let the rich man glory in his riches_ since Solomon's wealth was so great a snare to him_ and did him a great deal more hurt than Job's poverty did him. His recovery is a proof of the power of God's grace_ in bringing one back to God that has gone so far from him; it is a proof too of the riches of God's mercy in accepting him notwithstanding the many aggravations of his sin_ pursuant to the promise made to David_ that if his children should commit iniquity they should be corrected_ but not abandoned and disinherited_ 2 Sam. vii. 14_ 15. Let him therefore that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall; and let him that has fallen make haste to get up again_ and not despair either of assistance or acceptance therein.,20250223
That it is a practical profitable sermon. Solomon_ being brought to repentance_ resolves_ like his father_ to teach transgressors God's way (Ps. li. 13) and to give warning to all to take heed of splitting upon those rocks which had been fatal to him; and these were fruits meet for repentance. The fundamental error of the children of men_ and that which is at the bottom of all their departures from God_ is the same with that of our first parents_ hoping to be as gods by entertaining themselves with that which seems good for food_ pleasant to the eyes_ and desirable to make one wise. Now the scope of this book is to show that this is a great mistake_ that our happiness consists not in being as gods to ourselves_ to have what we will and do what we will_ but in having him that made us to be a God to us. The moral philosophers disputed much about man's felicity_ or chief good. Various opinions they had about it; but Solomon_ in this book_ determines the question_ and assures us that to fear God and to keep his commandments is the whole of man. He tried what satisfaction might be found in the wealth of the world and the pleasures of sense_ and at last pronounced all vanity and vexation; yet multitudes will not take his word_ but will make the same dangerous experiment_ and it proves fatal to them. He,20250223
That it is a serious thing to die; it is a work by itself. It is a change; there is a visible change in the body_ its appearance altered_ its actions brought to an end_ but a greater change with the soul_ which quits the body_ and removes to the world of spirits_ finishes its state of probation and enters upon that of retribution. This change will come_ and it will be a final change_ not like the transmutations of the elements_ which return to their former state. No_ we must die_ not thus to live again. It is but once to die_ and that had need be well done that is to be done but once. An error here is fatal_ conclusive_ and not again to be rectified. ,20250223
That it is absurd and unreasonable to expect this: __Should it be according to thy mind? No_ what reason for that?__ Elihu here speaks with a great deference to the divine will and wisdom_ and a satisfaction therein: it is highly fit that every thing should be according to God's mind. He speaks also with a just disdain of the pretensions of those that are proud_ and would be their own carvers: Should it be according to thy mind? Should we always have the good we have a mind to enjoy? We should then wrongfully encroach upon others and foolishly ensnare ourselves. Must we never be afflicted_ because we have no mind to it? Is it fit that sinners should feel no smart_ that scholars should be under no discipline? Or_ if we must be afflicted_ is it fit that we should choose what rod we will be beaten with? No; it is fit that every thing should be according to God's mind_ and not ours; for he is the Creator_ and we are creatures. He is infinitely wise and knowing; we are foolish and short-sighted. He is in one mind; we are in many,20250223
That it is all the good we can have out of the things of this world: It is our portion_ and in doing thus we take our portion_ and make the best of bad. This is our part of our worldly possession. God must have his part_ the poor theirs_ and our families theirs_ but this is ours; it is all that falls to our lot out of them. ,20250223
That it is an intelligent and divine person that here speaks seems very plain_ and that it is not meant of a mere essential property of the divine nature_ for Wisdom here has personal properties and actions; and that intelligent divine person can be no other than the Son of God himself_ to whom the principal things here spoken of wisdom are attributed in other scriptures_ and we must explain scripture by itself. If Solomon himself designed only the praise of wisdom as it is an attribute of God_ by which he made the world and governs it_ so to recommend to men the study of that wisdom which belongs to them_ yet the Spirit of God_ who indited what he wrote_ carried him_ as David often_ to such expressions as could agree to no other than the Son of God_ and would lead us into the knowledge of great things concerning him. All divine revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ_ which God gave unto him_ and here we are told who and what he is_ as God_ designed in the eternal counsels to be the Mediator between God and man. The best exposition of these verses we have in the first four verses of St. John's gospel. In the beginning was the Word_ &c. Concerning the Son of God observe here_,20250223
That it is determined_ in the counsel and decree of God_ how long we shall live and when we shall die. The number of our months is with God_ at the disposal of his power_ which cannot be controlled_ and under the view of his omniscience_ which cannot be deceived. It is certain that God's providence has the ordering of the period of our lives; our times are in his hand. The powers of nature depend upon him_ and act under him. In him we live and move. Diseases are his servants; he kills and makes alive. Nothing comes to pass by chance_ no_ not the execution done by a bow drawn at a venture. It is therefore certain that God's prescience has determined it before; for known unto God are all his works. Whatever he does he determined_ yet with a regard partly to the settled course of nature (the end and the means are determined together) and to the settled rules of moral government_ punishing evil and rewarding good in this life. We are no more governed by the Stoic's blind fate than by the Epicurean's blind fortune. ,20250223
That it is given them to be in safety_ v,20250223
That it is good and comely to do this. It is well_ and it looks well. Those that cheerfully use what God has given them thereby honour the giver_ answer the intention of the gift_ act rationally and generously_ do good in the world_ and make what they have turn to the best account_ and this is both their credit and their comfort; it is good and comely; there is duty and decency in it. ,20250223
That it is in vain_ and to no purpose_ to expect it: __He will recompense it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose. God will take his own way_ fulfil his own counsel_ and recompense according to the sentence of his own justice_ whether thou art pleased or displeased; he will neither ask thy leave nor ask thy advice_ but_ what he pleases_ that will he do. It is therefore thy wisdom to be easy_ and make a virtue of necessity; make the best of that which is_ because it is out of thy power to make it otherwise. If thou pretend to choose and refuse___ that is_ __to prescribe to God and except against what he does_ so will not I—I will acquiesce in all he does; and therefore speak what thou knowest; say what thou wilt do_ whether thou wilt oppose or submit. The matter lies plainly before thee; be at a point; thou art in God's hand_ not in mine.__,20250223
That it is not only a fault to pour out foolishness_ but it is a shame not to disperse knowledge_ at least not to drop some wise word or other: The heart of the foolish does not so; it has nothing to disperse that is good_ or_ if it had_ has neither skill nor will to do good with it and therefore is little worth.,20250223
That it is therefore below him_ and a diminution to his glory_ to take cognizance of this inferior part of the creation: He walks in the circuit of heaven_ and has enough to do to enjoy himself and his own perfections and glory in that bright and quiet world; why should he trouble himself about us? This is gross absurdity_ as well as gross impiety_ which Eliphaz here fathers upon Job; for it supposes that the administration of government is a burden and disparagement to the supreme governor and that the acts of justice and mercy are a toil to a mind infinitely wise_ holy_ and good. If the sun_ a creature_ and inanimate_ can with his light and influence reach this earth_ and every part of it (Ps. xix. even from that vast height of the visible heavens in which he is_ and in the circuit of which he walks_ and that through many a thick and dark cloud_ shall we question it concerning the Creator?,20250223
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth_ that the wicked might be shaken out of it? 14 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. 15 And from the wicked their light is withholden_ and the high arm shall be broken. 16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 17 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? 18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. 19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness_ where is the place thereof_ 20 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof_ and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?,20250223
That it puts him into a great consternation_ so that his hair stood on end. Ever since man sinned it has been terrible to him to receive an express from heaven_ as conscious to himself that he can expect no good tidings thence; apparitions therefore_ even of good spirits_ have always made deep impressions of fear_ even upon good men. How well it is for us that God sends us his messages_ not by spirits_ but by men like ourselves_ whose terror shall not make us afraid! See Dan. vii. 28; x. 8_ 9.,20250223
That it shall prove the way to be easy too_ so that even the days of old age shall not be evil days_ but days in which thou shalt have pleasure: Peace shall they be continually adding to thee. As grace increases_ peace shall increase; and of the increase of Christ's government and peace_ in the heart as well as in the world_ there shall be no end. Great and growing peace have those that love the law.,20250223
That it was a usual thing for Providence to extinguish the joys and hopes of wicked men as his were extinguished; and therefore that they had reason to suspect him for a hypocrite_ ver. 8-19.,20250223
That it was a very great disappointment to his expectation (v. 26): __When I looked for good_ for more good_ or at least for the continuance of what I had_ then evil came__—such uncertain things are all our worldly enjoyments_ and such a folly is it to feed ourselves with great expectations from them. Those that wait for light from the sparks of their creature comforts will be wretchedly disappointed and will make their bed in the darkness. ,20250223
That it was all labour in vain_ v,20250223
That it was indistinct_ and somewhat confused. He could not discern the form thereof_ so as to frame any exact idea of it in his own mind_ much less to give a description of it. His conscience was to be awakened and informed_ not his curiosity gratified. We know little of spirits; we are not capable of knowing much of them_ nor is it fit that we should: all in good time; we must shortly remove to the world of spirits_ and shall then be better acquainted with them,20250223
That it was needless to the person he was discoursing with; for he knew it_ and believed it_ and could speak of it as well as he and better_ and could add to the proofs which he had produced of God's power and greatness_ which he does in the rest of his discourse (ver. 5-13)_ concluding that_ when they had both said what they could_ all came short of the merit of the subject and it was still far from being exhausted_ ver. 14.,20250223
That it was not through any carelessness of his servants; for then his resentment might have spent itself upon them: The oxen were ploughing_ not playing_ and the asses not suffered to stray and so taken up as waifs_ but feeding beside them_ under the servant's eye_ each in their place; and those that passed by_ we may suppose_ blessed them_ and said_ God speed the plough. Note_ All our prudence_ care_ and diligence_ cannot secure us from affliction_ no_ not from those afflictions which are commonly owing to imprudence and negligence. Except the Lord keep the city_ the watchman_ though ever so wakeful_ wakes but in vain. Yet it is some comfort under a trouble if it found us in the way of our duty_ and not in any by-path. ,20250223
That it was real_ and not a dream_ not a fancy. An image was before his eyes; he plainly saw it; at first it passed and repassed before his face_ moved up and down_ but at length it stood still to speak to him. If some have been so knavish as to impose false visions on others_ and some so foolish as to be themselves imposed upon_ it does not therefore follow but that there may have been apparitions of spirits_ both good and bad,20250223
That it was to no purpose to attempt it: The hope of taking him is in vain_ v,20250223
That it will do us more good to go to a funeral than to go to a festival (v. 2): It is better to go to the house of mourning_ and there weep with those that weep_ than to go to the house of feasting_ to a wedding_ or a wake_ there to rejoice with those that do rejoice. It will do us more good_ and make better impressions upon us. We may lawfully go to both_ as there is occasion. Our Saviour both feasted at the wedding of his friend in Cana and wept at the grave of his friend in Bethany; and we may possibly glorify God_ and do good_ and get good_ in the house of feasting; but_ considering how apt we are to be vain and frothy_ proud and secure_ and indulgent of the flesh_ it is better for us to go to the house of mourning_ not to see the pomp of the funeral_ but to share in the sorrow of it_ and to learn good lessons_ both from the dead_ who is going thence to his long home_ and from the mourners_ who go about the streets.,20250223
That it would be an ease and satisfaction to himself to deliver his mind (v. 20): I will speak_ that I may be refreshed_ not only that I may be eased of the pain of stifling my thoughts_ but that I may have the pleasure of endeavouring_ according to my place and capacity_ to do good. It is a great refreshment to a good man to have liberty to speak for the glory of God and the edification of others.,20250223
That it would he much more his folly to heed them; for,20250223
That joy of the Lord which is to be found only in the way of the Lord will be our strength (Neh. viii. and therefore the righteous shall never be removed. Those that have an established virtue have an established peace and happiness which nothing can rob them of; they have an everlasting foundation_ v. 25,20250223
That labour which is necessary_ and would be profitable_ and might be gone through with ease_ wearies them_ because they go about it awkwardly and foolishly_ and so make their business a toil to them_ which_ if they applied themselves to it prudently_ would be a pleasure to them. Many complain of the labours of religion as grievous_ which they would have no reason to complain of if the exercises of Christian piety were always under the direction of Christian prudence. The foolish tire themselves in endless pursuits_ and never bring any thing to pass_ because they know not how to go to the city_ that is_ because they have not capacity to apprehend the plainest thing_ such as the entrance into a great city is_ where one would think it were impossible for a man to miss his road. Men's imprudent management of their business robs them both of the comfort and of the benefit of it. But it is the excellency of the way to the heavenly city that it is a high-way_ in which the wayfaring men_ though fools_ shall not err (Isa. xxxv. 8); yet sinful folly makes men miss that way.,20250223
That life and its light were very short: __Are not my days few? v,20250223
That man is much more so,20250223
That men may be humbled_ may be vilified_ may be mortified—that they might see that they themselves are beasts. It is no easy matter to convince proud men that they are but men (Ps. ix. much more to convince bad men that they are beasts_ that_ being destitute of religion_ they are as the beasts that perish_ as the horse and the mule that have no understanding. Proud oppressors are as beasts_ as roaring lions and ranging bears. Nay_ every man that minds his body only_ and not his soul_ makes himself no better than a brute_ and must wish_ at least_ to die like one.,20250223
That men of great repute should be deceivers. If it is unbecoming a despicable man to presume to speak as a philosopher or politician_ and nobody heeds him_ being prejudiced against his character_ much more unbecoming is it for a prince_ for a man of honour_ to take advantage from his character and the confidence that is put in him to lie_ and dissemble_ and make no conscience of breaking his word. Lying ill becomes any man_ but worst a prince_ so corrupt is the modern policy_ which insinuates that princes ought not to make themselves slaves to their words further than is for their interest_ and Qui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare—He who knows not how to dissemble knows not how to reign.,20250223
That men's dishonesty will be their shame: He that perverts his way_ that turns aside into crooked paths_ that dissembles with God and man_ looks one way and rows another_ though he may for a time disguise himself_ and pass current_ shall be known to be what he is. It is a thousand to one but some time or other he betrays himself; at least_ God will discover him in the great day. He that perverts his ways documento erit—shall be made an example of_ for warning to others; so some.,20250223
That men's integrity will be their security: He that walks uprightly towards God and man_ that is faithful to both_ that designs as he ought and means as he says_ walks surely; he is safe under a divine protection and easy in a holy security. He goes on his way with a humble boldness_ being well armed against the temptations of Satan_ the troubles of the world_ and the reproaches of men. He knows what ground he stands on_ what guide he follows_ what guard he is surrounded with_ and what glory he is going to_ and therefore proceeds with assurance and great peace_ Isa. xxxii. 17; xxxiii. 15_ 16. Some understand it as part of the character of an upright man_ that he walks surely_ in opposition to walking at all adventures. He will not dare to do that which he is not fully satisfied in his own conscience concerning the lawfulness of_ but will see his way clear in every thing,20250223
That name was but little known to the patriarchs before Moses_ Exod. vi,20250223
That neither he nor they were able to speak of the glory of God in any proportion to the merit of the subject_ v. 19_ 20. 1. He challenges Job to be their director_ if he durst undertake the task. He speaks it ironically: __Teach us_ if thou canst_ what we shall say unto him_ v,20250223
That no blot had cleaved to his hands_ that is_ he was not chargeable with getting any thing dishonestly_ or keeping that which was another's_ whenever it appeared to be so. Injustice is a blot_ a blot to the estate_ a blot to the owner; it spoils the beauty of both_ and therefore is to be dreaded. Those that deal much in the world may perhaps have a blot come upon their hands_ but they must wash it off again by repentance and restitution_ and not let it cleave to their hands. See Isa. xxxiii. 15.,20250223
That nothing is more offensive to God than hypocrisy and double-dealing_ for these are signified by the word which we translate frowardness_ pretending justice_ but intending wrong_ walking in crooked ways_ to avoid discovery. Those are of a froward heart who act in contradiction to that which is good_ under a profession of that which is good_ and such are_ more than any sinners_ an abomination to the Lord_ Isa. lxv,20250223
That of our Saviour agrees with this_ If thou wilt enter into life_ keep the commandments_ Matt. xix,20250223
That our expectations from this world are as uncertain and deceitful as our enjoyments are. Since every thing is vanity_ Who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? He can no more please himself with the hopes of what shall be after him_ to his children and family_ than with the relish of what is with him_ since he can neither foresee himself_ nor can any one else foretel to him_ what shall be after him. Nor shall he have any intelligence sent him of it when he is gone. His sons come to honour_ and he knows it not. So that_ look which way we will_ Vanity of vanity_ all is vanity.,20250223
That our feet do not stumble when we run. If wise and good men be put upon sudden resolves_ the certain rule of God's word which they go by will keep them even then from stumbling upon any thing that may be pernicious. Integrity and uprightness will preserve us. Thirdly_ __It will be thy honour and reputation,20250223
That our life will come to an end; our days upon earth are not numberless_ are not endless_ no_ they are numbered_ and will soon be finished_ Dan.,20250223
That our senses are unsatisfied_ and the objects of them unsatisfying. He specifies those senses that perform their office with least toil_ and are most capable of being pleased: The eye is not satisfied with seeing_ but is weary of seeing always the same sight_ and covets novelty and variety. The ear is fond_ at first_ of a pleasant song or tune_ but soon nauseates it_ and must have another; both are surfeited_ but neither satiated_ and what was most grateful becomes ungrateful. Curiosity is still inquisitive_ because still unsatisfied_ and the more it is humoured the more nice and peevish it grows_ crying_ Give_ give.,20250223
That parents should observe their children_ that they may discover their disposition and genius_ and both manage and dispose of them accordingly_ drive the nail that will go and draw out that which goes amiss. Wisdom is herein profitable to direct.,20250223
That prosperity which is raised by sin is built on the sand_ and so it will soon appear.,20250223
That proud people are wicked people_ and pride is at the bottom of a great deal of the wickedness that is in this world both towards God and man. ,20250223
That religion is so far from destroying good manners that it reaches us to behave ourselves lowly and reverently towards our superiors_ to keep our distance_ and give place to those to whom it belongs __Put not forth thyself rudely and carelessly in the king's presence_ or in the presence of great men; do not compare with them__ (so some understand it); __do not vie with them in apparel_ furniture_ gardens_ house-keeping_ or retinue_ for that is an affront to them and will waste thy own estate.__ 2. That religion teaches us humility and self-denial_ which is a better lesson than that of good manners: __Deny thyself the place thou art entitled to; covet not to make a fair show_ nor air at preferment_ nor thrust thyself into the company of those that are above thee; be content in a low sphere if that is it which God has allotted to thee.__ The reason he gives is because this is really the way to advancement_ as our Saviour shows in a parable that seems to be borrowed from this_ Luke xiv,20250223
That she shall be highly praised (v. 29): Many have done virtuously. Virtuous women_ it seems_ are precious jewels_ but not such rare jewels as was represented v,20250223
That she shall be incontestably praised_ without contradiction_ v,20250223
That she was admired by all her acquaintance_ not only the daughters_ who were her juniors_ but even the queens and the concubines_ who might have reason to be jealous of her as a rival; they all blessed her_ and wished well to her_ praised her_ and spoke well of her. The daughters of Jerusalem called her the fairest among women; all agreed to give her the pre-eminence for beauty_ and every sheaf bowed to hers. Note_ ,20250223
That she was her mother's darling; she had that in her_ from a child_ which recommended her to the particular affection of her parents. As Solomon himself is said to have been tender and an only one in the sight of his mother (Prov. iv. so was she the only one of her mother_ as dear as if she had been an only one_ and_ if there were many more_ yet she was the choice one of her that bore her_ more excellent than all the societies of men this world ever produced. All the kingdoms of the world_ and the glory of them_ are nothing_ in Christ's account_ compared with the church_ which is made up of the excellent ones of the earth_ the precious sons of Zion_ comparable to fine gold_ and more excellent than their neighbours,20250223
That sociableness is the cure of this evil. Men are thus sordid because they are all for themselves. Now Solomon shows here_ by divers instances_ that it is not good for man to be alone (Gen. ii. 18); he designs hereby to recommend to us both marriage and friendship_ two things which covetous misers decline_ because of the charge of them; but such are the comfort and advantage of them both_ if prudently contracted_ that they will very well quit cost. Man_ in paradise itself_ could not be happy without a mate_ and therefore is no sooner made than matched. 1. Solomon lays this down for a truth_ That two are better than one_ and more happy jointly than either of them could be separately_ more pleased in one another than they could be in themselves only_ mutually serviceable to each other's welfare_ and by a united strength more likely to do good to others: They have a good reward of their labour; whatever service they do_ it is returned to them another way. He that serves himself only has himself only for his paymaster_ and commonly proves more unjust and ungrateful to himself than his friend_ if he should serve him_ would be to him; witness him that labours endlessly and yet bereaves his soul of good; he has no reward of his labour. But he that is kind to another has a good reward; the pleasure and advantage of holy love will be an abundant recompence for all the work and labour of love. Hence Solomon infers the mischief of solitude: Woe to him that is alone. He lies exposed to many temptations which good company and friendship would prevent and help him to guard against; he wants that advantage which a man has by the countenance of his friend_ as iron has of being sharpened by iron. A monastic life then was surely never intended for a state of perfection_ nor should those be reckoned the greatest lovers of God who cannot find in their hearts to love any one else,20250223
That take care to keep it when they have got it; it is health_ and wealth_ and honour_ and all_ to the soul_ and therefore he that keeps understanding_ as he shows that he loves his own soul_ so he shall certainly find good_ all good. He that retains the good lessons he has learnt_ and orders his conversation according to them_ shall find the benefit and comfort of it in his own soul and shall be happy here and for ever.,20250223
That take pains to get wisdom_ to get knowledge_ and grace_ and acquaintance with God; those that do so show that they love their own souls_ and will be found to have done themselves the greatest kindness imaginable. No man ever hated his own flesh_ but loves that_ yet many are wanting in love to their own souls_ for only those love their souls_ and consequently love themselves_ aright_ that get wisdom_ true wisdom,20250223
That that counsel cannot be altered_ and therefore it is our wisdom to make a virtue of necessity_ by submitting to it. It must be as God wills: I know (and every one knows it that knows any thing of God) that whatsoever God does it shall be for ever_ v,20250223
That that counsel needs not to be altered_ for there is nothing amiss in it_ nothing that can be am ended. If we could see it altogether at one view_ we should see it so perfect that nothing can be put to it_ for there is no deficiency in it_ nor any thing taken from it_ for there is nothing in it unnecessary_ or that can be spared. As the word of God_ so the works of God are every one of them perfect in its kind_ and it is presumption for us either to add to them or to diminish from them_ Deut. iv,20250223
That the afflictions which are borne well will end well; and Job particularly_ if he would come to a better temper_ might assure himself that God had great mercy in store for him_ ver. 17-27. So that he concludes his discourse in somewhat a better humour than he began it.,20250223
That the bounds God has fixed we cannot pass; for his counsels are unalterable_ his foresight being infallible.,20250223
That the brightest creatures are imperfect and impure before God_ v,20250223
That the clouds above distil upon the earth below. If the heavens become brass_ the earth becomes iron; therefore thus the promise of plenty runs_ I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth. This intimates to us that every good gift is from above_ from him who is both Father of lights and Father of the rain_ and it instructs us to direct our prayers to him and to look up. ,20250223
That the issue would certainly be comfortable_ v,20250223
That the multiplying of words in our devotions will make them the sacrifices of fools_ v,20250223
That the prosperity of the righteous has a good bottom and will endure. Death will remove them_ but their house shall stand_ their families shall be kept up_ and the generation of the upright shall be blessed.,20250223
That the sin of sinners is their ruin_ ver. 2-5.,20250223
That the sins of youth are often the smart of age both in respect of sorrow within (Jer. xxxi. 18_ 19) and suffering without_ ch. xx,20250223
That the soul is a spirit_ neither material itself nor dependent upon matter_ but capable of conversing with things spiritual_ which are not the objects of sense. ,20250223
That the terrors of God_ which set themselves in array against him_ put him into such confusion that he knew not how to address God with the confidence with which he was formerly wont to approach him_ v. 34_ 35. __Besides the distance which I am kept at by his infinite transcendency_ his present dealings with me are very discouraging: Let him take his rod away from me.__ He means not so much his outward afflictions as the load which lay upon his spirit from the apprehensions of God's wrath; that was his fear which terrified him. __Let that be removed; let me recover the sight of his mercy_ and not be amazed with the sight of nothing but his terrors_ and then I would speak and order my cause before him. But it is not so with me; the cloud is not at all dissipated; the wrath of God still fastens upon me_ and preys on my spirits_ as much as ever; and what to do I know not.__,20250223
That the terrors of the Almighty were inflicted and impressed upon him. God held him for his enemy_ shot his arrows at him (ch. vi. and set him as a mark_ ch. vii,20250223
That the time of our enjoyment of these things is very short_ and only while we accomplish as a hireling his day. We continue in the world but for one generation_ which is continually passing away to make room for another_ and we are passing with it. Our worldly possessions we very lately had from others_ and must very shortly leave to others_ and therefore to us they are vanity; they can be no more substantial than that life which is the substratum of them_ and that is but a vapour_ which appears for a little while and then vanishes away. While the stream of mankind is continually flowing_ how little enjoyment has one drop of that stream of the pleasant banks between which it glides! We may give God the glory of that constant succession of generations_ in which the world has hitherto had its existence_ and will have to the end of time_ admitting his patience in continuing that sinful species and his power in continuing that dying species. We may be also quickened to do the work of our generation diligently_ and serve it faithfully_ because it will be over shortly; and_ in concern for mankind in general_ we should consult the welfare of succeeding generations; but as to our own happiness_ let us not expect it within such narrow limits_ but in an eternal rest and consistency,20250223
That the triumphing of the wicked is short. They may be exalted for a while_ but in a little time they are overthrown and are not; their trouble proves their overthrow_ and those who made a great show disappear_ and their place knows them no more. Turn the wicked_ and they are not; they stand in such a slippery place that the least touch of trouble brings them down_ like the apples of Sodom_ which look fair_ but touch them and they go to dust,20250223
That their condition_ in reference to this world (for of that he speaks)_ is no better than that of the beasts_ ver. 18-21. And therefore he concludes that it is our wisdom to make use of what power we have for our own comfort_ and not to oppress others with it.,20250223
That their death shall be seasonable_ and they shall finish their course_ at length_ with joy and honour_ v,20250223
That their father (God enabling him to do it) supplied them with great fortunes: He gave them inheritance among their brethren_ and did not turn them off with small portions_ as most did. It is probable that they had some extraordinary personal merit_ which Job had an eye to in the extraordinary favour he showed them. Perhaps they excelled their brethren in wisdom and piety; and therefore_ that they might continue in his family_ to be a stay and blessing to it_ he made them co-heirs with their brethren.,20250223
That their houses and families shall be comfortable to them_ v,20250223
That their posterity shall be numerous and prosperous. Job had lost all his children; __but___ says Eliphaz_ __if thou return to God_ he will again build up thy family_ and thy seed shall be many and as great as ever_ and thy offspring increasing and flourishing as the grass of the earth (v. and thou shalt know it.__ God has blessings in store for the seed of the faithful_ which they shall have if they do not stand in their own light and forfeit them by their folly. It is a comfort to parents to see the prosperity_ especially the spiritual prosperity_ of their children; if they are truly good_ they are truly great_ how small a figure soever they may make in the world.,20250223
That their prosperity is short and their destruction certain_ v. 3-5. He seems here to parallel Job's case with that which is commonly the case of wicked people. 1. Job had prospered for a time_ seemed confirmed_ and was secure in his prosperity; and it is common for foolish wicked men to do so: I have seen them taking root—planted_ and_ in their own and others' apprehension_ fixed_ and likely to continue. See Jer. xii. 2; Ps. xxxvii. 35_ 36. We see worldly men taking root in the earth; on earthly things they fix the standing of their hopes_ and from them they draw the sap of their comforts. The outward estate may be flourishing_ but the soul cannot prosper that takes root in the earth,20250223
That there are innumerable before us; it is a tracked road_ which may help to take off the terror of it. To die is ire ad plures—to go to the great majority,20250223
That there can be no success against God_ and therefore they must never act in opposition to him_ in contempt of his commands_ or in contradiction to his counsels. Though they think they have wisdom_ and understanding_ and counsel_ the best politics and politicians_ on their side_ yet_ if it be against the Lord_ it cannot prosper long; it shall not prevail at last. He that sits in heaven laughs at men's projects against him and his anointed_ and will carry his point in spite of them_ Ps. ii. 1-6. Those that fight against God are preparing shame and ruin for themselves; whoever make war with the Lamb_ he will certainly overcome them_ Rev. xvii. 14,20250223
That there can be no success without God_ and therefore they must never act but in dependence on him. Be the cause ever so good_ and the patrons of it ever so strong_ and wise_ and faithful_ and the means of carrying it on_ and gaining the point_ ever so probable_ still they must acknowledge God and take him along with them. Means indeed are to be used; the horse must be prepared against the day of battle_ and the foot too; they must be armed and disciplined. In Solomon's time even Israel's kings used horses in war_ though they were forbidden to multiply them. But_ after all_ safety and salvation are of the Lord; he can save without armies_ but armies cannot save without him; and therefore he must be sought to and trusted in for success_ and when success is obtained he must have all the glory. When we are preparing for the day of battle our great concern must be to make God our friend and secure his favour.,20250223
That there is a Redeemer provided for fallen man_ and Jesus Christ is that Redeemer. The word is Goël which is used for the next of kin_ to whom_ by the law of Moses_ the right of redeeming a mortgaged estate did belong_ Lev. xxv,20250223
That there is a world of angels_ for there are higher than they_ who are employed by the divine justice for protecting the injured and punishing the injurious. Sennacherib valued himself highly upon his potent army_ but one angel proved too hard for him and all his forces. Some_ by those that are higher than they understand the great council of the nation_ the presidents to whom the princes of the provinces are accountable (Dan. vi.the senate that receive complaints against the proconsuls_ the courts above to which appeals are made from the inferior courts_ which are necessary to the good government of a kingdom. Let it be a check to oppressors that perhaps their superiors on earth may call them to an account; however_ God the Supreme in heaven will.,20250223
That there is good reason for this_ because those that are good do good_ but (as saith the proverb of the ancients) wickedness proceeds from the wicked. 1. Good men are public blessings—Vir bonus est commune bonum. By the blessing of the upright_ the blessings with which they are blessed_ which enlarge their sphere of usefulness_—by the blessings with which they bless their neighbours_ their advice_ their example_ their prayers_ and all the instances of their serviceableness to the public interest_—by the blessings with which God blesses others for their sake_—by these the city is exalted and made more comfortable to the inhabitants_ and more considerable among its neighbours,20250223
That there is in the world a great deal of vain knowledge_ science falsely so called_ that is useless_ and therefore worthless,20250223
That there might appear a more than ordinary displeasure of God against him in his troubles_ and by that he might be exasperated against divine Providence_ as if it were resolved_ right or wrong_ to ruin him_ and not give him time to speak for himself,20250223
That there was no arbitrator or umpire to adjust the differences between him and God and to determine the controversy (v. 33): Neither is there any days-man between us. This complaint that there was not is in effect a wish that there were_ and so the LXX. reads it: O that there were a mediator between us! Job would gladly refer the matter_ but no creature was capable of being a referee_ and therefore he must even refer it still to God himself and resolve to acquiesce in his judgment. Our Lord Jesus is the blessed days-man_ who has mediated between heaven and earth_ has laid his hand upon us both; to him the Father has committed all judgment_ and we must. But this matter was not then brought to so clear a light as it is now by the gospel_ which leaves no room for such a complaint as this. ,20250223
That there was no great use to be made of it. Cui bono—What good hast thou done by all that thou hast said? How hast thou_ with all this mighty flourish_ helped him that is without power?,20250223
That therefore being still continued to man_ notwithstanding his defection (Gen. ix. is still to be reckoned one of the most considerable instances of men's wealth_ honour_ and power_ Ps. viii. 6.,20250223
That therefore it is the duty of every one of us to wait for that change_ and to continue waiting all the days of our appointed time. The time of life is an appointed time; that time is to be reckoned by days; and those days are to be spent in waiting for our change. That is_ First_ We must expect that it will come_ and think much of it. Secondly_ We must desire that it would come_ as those that long to be with Christ. Thirdly_ We must be willing to tarry until it does come_ as those that believe God's time to be the best. Fourthly_ We must give diligence to get ready against it comes_ that it may be a blessed change to us.,20250223
That therefore our life upon earth is what we have no reason to take any great complacency in_ or to be confident of the continuance of. It is to be reckoned by days; it is but a vain life_ and we spend it as a shadow_ so little is there in it substantial_ so fleeting_ so uncertain_ so transitory is it_ and so little in it to be fond of or to be depended on. If all the comforts of life be vanity_ life itself can have no great reality in it to constitute a happiness for us. ,20250223
That therefore they are durable riches. Wealth gotten by vanity will soon be diminished_ but that which is well got will wear well and will be left to the children's children_ and that which is well spent in works of piety and charity is put out to the best interest and so will be durable; for the friends made by the mammon of unrighteousness when we fail will receive us into everlasting habitations_ Luke xvi,20250223
That therefore we are not to think it strange if they prosper greatly in this world and fall under no visible token of God's wrath. Therefore they are spared now_ because they are to be punished then; therefore the workers of iniquity flourish_ that they may be destroyed for ever_ Ps. xcii,20250223
That they are but tried. It is not intended for their hurt_ but for their honour and benefit; it is the trial of their faith_ 1 Pet. i,20250223
That they are exalted for a while. They seem to be the favourites of heaven_ and value themselves as making the best figure on earth. They are set up in honour_ set up (as they think) out of the reach of danger_ and lifted up in the pride of their own spirits,20250223
That they are here said to distil upon man (v. 28); for_ though indeed God causes it to rain in the wilderness where no man is (ch. xxxviii. 26_ Ps. civ. yet special respect is had to man herein_ to whom the inferior creatures are all made serviceable and from whom the actual return of the tribute of praise is required. Among men_ he causes his rain to fall upon the just and upon the unjust_ Matt. v,20250223
That they are riches and righteousness_ riches honestly got_ not by fraud and oppression_ but in regular ways_ and riches charitably used_ for alms are called righteousness. Those that have their wealth from God's blessing on their industry_ and that have a heart to do good with it_ have riches and righteousness. ,20250223
That they are so far from doing them any real hurt that_ by the grace of God working with them_ they do a great deal of good_ and are happy means of their satisfaction.,20250223
That they came with a design (and we have reason to think it was a sincere design) to comfort him_ and yet proved miserable comforters_ through their unskilful management of his case. Many that aim well do_ by mistake_ come short of their aim.,20250223
That they continued their friendship with Job in his adversity_ when most of his friends had forsaken him_ ch. xix,20250223
That they could not destroy him_ could not fill his head with fish-spears_ v,20250223
That they could not enrich themselves with the spoil of him: Shall they part him among the merchants_ the bones to one_ the oil to another? If they can catch him_ they will; but it is probable that the art of fishing for whales was not brought to perfection then_ as it has been since,20250223
That they made a pretence of kindness: __You dig a pit for your friend; not only you are unkind to me_ who am your friend_ but_ under colour of friendship_ you ensnare me.__ When they came to see and sit with him he thought he might speak his mind freely to them_ and that the more bitter his complaints to them were the more they would endeavour to comfort him. This made him take a greater liberty than otherwise he would have done. David_ though he smothered his resentments when the wicked were before him_ would probably have given vent to them if none had been by but friends_ Ps.,20250223
That they made an appointment to come. Note_ Good people should make appointments among themselves for doing good_ so exciting and binding one another to it_ and assisting and encouraging one another in it. For the carrying on of any pious design let hand join in hand. ,20250223
That they may be a comfort to their parents and may make their hearts glad_ even when the evil days come_ and so recompense them for their care_ ch. xxiii. 15,20250223
That they may be a credit to them: __That I may answer him that reproaches me with having been over-strict and severe in bringing up my children_ and having taken a wrong method with them in restraining them from the liberties which other young people take. My son_ be wise_ and then it will appear_ in the effect_ that I went the wisest way to work with my children.__ Those that have been blessed with a religious education should in every thing conduct themselves so as to be a credit to their education and to silence those who say_ A young saint_ an old devil; and to prove the contrary_ A young saint_ an old angel.,20250223
That they not only consist with_ but flow from_ covenant-love. ,20250223
That they ought to pity him_ v,20250223
That they rest upon this_ that is_ they rely upon this as sufficient to warrant all their violences. Because sentence against their evil works is not executed speedily they think that there is no great evil in them_ and that God is not displeased with them_ nor will ever call them to an account. Their prosperity is their security,20250223
That they shall come forth as gold_ pure in itself and precious to the refiner. They shall come forth as gold approved and improved_ found to be good and made to be better. Afflictions are to us as we are; those that go gold into the furnace will come out no worse.,20250223
That they shall have a holy security and serenity of mind_ arising from their hope and confidence in God_ even in the worst of times. When dangers are most threatening they shall be easy_ believing themselves safe; and they shall not be afraid of destruction_ no_ not when they see it coming (v. nor of the beasts of the field when they set upon them_ nor of men as cruel as beasts; nay_ at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh (v. not so as to despise any of God's chastenings or make a jest of his judgments_ but so as to triumph in God_ in his power and goodness_ and therein to triumph over the world and all its grievances_ to be not only easy_ but cheerful and joyful_ in tribulation. Blessed Paul laughed at destruction when he said_ O death! where is thy sting? when_ in the name of all the saints_ he defied all the calamities of this present time to separate us from the love of God_ concluding that in all these things we are more than conquerors_ Rom. viii. 35_ &c. See Isa. xxxvii. 22.,20250223
That they shall not enrich themselves with the spoil of their neighbours. Even the old lion is famished_ and perishes for lack of prey. Those that have surfeited on spoil and rapine are perhaps reduced to such straits as to die of hunger at last. ,20250223
That they shall not tear. God will disarm them_ will take away their power to do hurt: The teeth of the young lions are broken. See Ps. iii,20250223
That they shall not terrify. The voice of their roaring shall be stopped. ,20250223
That they shall not_ as they promise themselves_ leave a succession: The stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad_ to seek for food themselves_ which the old ones used to bring in for them_ Nah. ii,20250223
That they were his neighbours_ his friends_ his companions (so the word signifies)_ and the scoffs of such are often most spitefully given_ and always most indignantly received. Ps. lv. 12_ 13_ It was not an enemy that reproached me; then I would have slighted it_ and so borne it; but it was thou_ a man_ my equal. ,20250223
That they were not sent for_ but came of their own accord (ch. vi. whence Mr. Caryl observes that it is good manners to be an unbidden guest at the house of mourning_ and_ in comforting our friends_ to anticipate their invitations. ,20250223
That they were professors of religion_ such as called upon God_ and said that he answered them: for some understand that of the persons mocking. __They are such as have a regard to heaven_ and an interest in heaven_ whose prayers I would therefore be glad of and thankful for_ whose good opinion I cannot but covet_ and therefore whose censures are the more grievous.__ Note_ It is sad that any who call upon God should mock their brethren (Jam. iii. 9_ and it cannot but lie heavily on a good man to be thought ill of by those whom he thinks well of_ yet this is no new thing.,20250223
That they will be called to account for it in the other world_ ver. 17,20250223
That they would be abundantly confirmed in their suspicion unless God did speedily appear for his relief_ ver. 20-22.,20250223
That this is that which he would do_ and which he would fain have leave to do_ in which he places his happiness and on which he sets his heart. ,20250223
That this is the knowledge that puffs up_ with which men swell in a fond conceit of their own accomplishments,20250223
That this is the way to make our own lives easy and to relieve ourselves against the many toils and troubles which our lives on earth are incident to (v. 20): He shall not much remember the days of his life_ the days of his sorrow and sore travail_ his working days_ his weeping days. He shall either forget them or remember them as waters that pass away; he shall not much lay to heart his crosses_ nor long retain the bitter relish of them_ because God answers him in the joy of his heart_ balances all the grievances of his labour with the joy of it and recompenses him for it by giving him to eat the labour of his hands. If he does not answer all his desires and expectations_ in the letter of them_ yet he answers them with that which is more than equivalent_ in the joy of his heart. A cheerful spirit is a great blessing; it makes the yoke of our employments easy and the burden of our afflictions light.,20250223
That this world is_ at the best_ a weary land: All is vanity_ for all is full of labour. The whole creation is made subject to this vanity ever since man was sentenced to eat bread in the sweat of his brows. If we survey the whole creation_ we shall see all busy; all have enough to do to mind their own business; none will be a portion or happiness for man; all labour to serve him_ but none prove a help-meet for him. Man cannot express how full of labour all things are_ can neither number the laborious nor measure the labours,20250223
That those are in the right that do not only receive instruction_ but retain it_ that do not let it slip through carelessness_ as most do_ nor let it go to those that would rob them of it_ that keep instruction safely_ keep it pure and entire_ keep it for their own use_ that they may govern themselves by it_ keep it for the benefit of others_ that they may instruct them; those that do so are in the way of life_ the way that has true comfort in it and eternal life at the end of it,20250223
That those are in the wrong that do not only not receive instruction_ but wilfully and obstinately refuse it when it is offered them. They will not be taught their duty because it discovers their faults to them; that instruction which carries reproof in it they have a particular aversion to_ and certainly they err; it is a sign that they err in judgment_ and have false notions of good and evil; it is a cause of their erring in conversation. The traveller that has missed his way_ and cannot bear to be told of it and shown the right way_ must needs err still_ err endlessly; he certainly misses the way of life.,20250223
That those who are selfish and false_ who betray their country_ oppress the poor_ and sow discord_ and thus cause shame_ shall be displaced and banished the court_ whatever friends they may make to speak for them.,20250223
That those who are wise and good do ordinarily prosper in this world. This he only hints at,20250223
That those who behave themselves wisely shall be respected and preferred_ whatever enemies they may have that seek to undermine them. No man's services shall be neglected to please a party or a favourite,20250223
That those who exalt themselves shall be abased. Those that think to gain respect by lifting up themselves above their rank_ by looking high_ talking big_ appearing fine_ and applauding themselves_ will on the contrary expose themselves to contempt_ lose their reputation_ and provoke God by humbling providences to bring them down and lay them low,20250223
That those who have money in their eye_ and set their hearts upon it_ will do any thing for it: A bribe is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that takes it; it has a great influence upon him_ and he will be sure to go the way that it leads him_ hither and thither_ though contrary to justice and not consistent with himself.,20250223
That those who have money in their hand think they can do any thing with it. Rich men value a little money as if it were a precious stone_ and value themselves on it as if it gave them not only ornament_ but power_ and every one were bound to be at their beck_ even justice itself. Whithersoever they turn this sparkling diamond they expect it should dazzle the eyes of all_ and make them do just what they would have them do in hopes of it. The deepest bag will carry the cause. Fee high_ and you may have what you will,20250223
That those who humble themselves shall be exalted_ and shall be established in their dignity: Honour shall uphold the humble in spirit; their humility is their honour_ and that shall make them truly and safely great_ and recommend them to the esteem of all that are wise and good.,20250223
That though now his light was eclipsed it should shine out again_ and more brightly than ever (v. 17)_—that even his setting sun should out-shine his noon-day sun_ and his evening be fair and clear as the morning_ in respect both of honour and pleasure.—that his light should shine out of obscurity (Isa. lviii. and the thick and dark cloud_ from behind which his sun should break forth_ would serve as a foil to its lustre_—that it should shine even in old age_ and those evil days should be good days to him. Note_ Those that truly turn to God then begin to shine forth; their path is as the shining light which increases_ the period of their day will be the perfection of it_ and their evening to this world will be their morning to a better.,20250223
That uncleanness is a sin that forfeits all good_ and shuts us out from the hope of it (v. 2): What portion of God is there from above? What blessing can such impure sinners expect from the pure and holy God_ or what token of his favour? What inheritance of the Almighty can they look for from on high? There is no portion_ no inheritance_ no true happiness_ for a soul_ but what is in God_ in the Almighty_ and what comes from above_ from on high. Those that wallow in uncleanness render themselves utterly unfit for communion with God_ either in grace here or in glory hereafter_ and become allied to unclean spirits_ which are for ever separated from him; and then what portion_ what inheritance_ can they have with God? No unclean thing shall enter into the New Jerusalem_ that holy city. ,20250223
That we cannot vie with God for beauty and majesty_ v,20250223
That we cannot vie with God for power; and therefore_ as it is great impiety_ so it is great impudence to contest with him_ and is as much against our interest as it is against reason and justice,20250223
That we do not know what to wish for_ because that which we promise ourselves most satisfaction in often proves most vexatious to us: Who knows what is good for a man in this life_ where every thing is vanity_ and any thing_ even that which we most covet_ may prove a calamity to us? Thoughtful people are in care to do every thing for the best_ if they knew it; but as it is an instance of the corruption of our hearts that we are apt to desire that as good for us which is really hurtful_ as children that cry for knives to cut their fingers with_ so is it an instance of the vanity of this world that what_ according to all probable conjectures_ seems to be for the best_ often proves otherwise; such is our shortsightedness concerning the issues and events of things_ and such broken reeds are all our creature-confidences. We know not how to advise others for the best_ nor how to act ourselves_ because that which we apprehend likely to be for our welfare may become a trap. ,20250223
That we live in a world of changes_ that the several events of time_ and conditions of human life_ are vastly different from one another_ and yet occur promiscuously_ and we are continually passing and repassing between them_ as in the revolutions of every day and every year. In the wheel of nature (Jam. iii. 6) sometimes one spoke is uppermost and by and by the contrary; there is a constant ebbing and flowing_ waxing and waning; from one extreme to the other does the fashion of this world change_ ever did_ and ever will,20250223
That we may be useful and serviceable to others for their instruction: __That thou mayest give a good account of the words of truth to those that send to thee to consult thee as an oracle___ or (as the margin reads it) __to those that send thee_ that employ thee as an agent or ambassador in any business.__ Knowledge is given us to do good with_ that others may light their candle at our lamp_ and that we may in our place serve our generation according to the will of God; and those who make conscience of keeping God's commandments will be best able to give a reason of the hope that is in them.,20250223
That we may have a confidence in him and communion with him. That thy trust may be in the Lord_ v,20250223
That we may have a satisfaction in our own judgment: __That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mayest know what is truth_ mayest plainly distinguish between it and falsehood_ and mayest know upon what grounds thou receivest and believest the truths of God.__ Note_ ,20250223
That we must make it our business_ and not a by-business_ as the merchant bestows the main of his thoughts and time upon his merchandise. ,20250223
That we must shortly take our leave of all the things that are seen_ that are temporal. The eye of the body must be closed_ and shall no more see good_ the good which most men set their hearts upon; for their cry is_ Who will make us to see good? Ps. iv,20250223
That we must then remove to an invisible world: The eye of him that hath here seen me shall see me no more there. It is hades—an unseen state_ v.,20250223
That we must venture all in it_ as a stock in trade_ and be willing to part with all for it. This is that pearl of great price which_ when we have found it_ we must willingly sell all for the purchase of_ Matt. xiii. 45_ 46. Buy the truth_ (Prov. xxiii. 23); he does not say at what rate_ because we must buy it at any rate rather than miss it.,20250223
That we ought industriously to avoid every thing that may be an occasion of this sin or a step towards it. Those that would be kept from harm must keep out of harm's way. Such tinder there is in the corrupt nature that it is madness_ upon any pretence whatsoever_ to come near the sparks. If we thrust ourselves into temptation_ we mocked God when we prayed_ Lead us not into temptation. ,20250223
That we ought to be jealous over ourselves with a godly jealousy_ and not to be so confident of the strength of our own resolutions as to venture upon the brink of sin_ with a promise to ourselves that hitherto we will come and no further. ,20250223
That we ought to have a very great dread and detestation of the sin. We must fear it as we would a place infected with the plague; we must loathe it as the odour of carrion_ that we will not come near. Then we are likely to preserve our purity when we conceive a rooted antipathy to all fleshly lusts. ,20250223
That we then use knowledge aright when we disperse it_ not confine it to a few of our intimates_ and grudge it to others who would make as good use of it_ but give a portion of this spiritual alms to seven and also to eight_ not only be communicative_ but diffusive_ of this good_ with humility and prudence. We must take pains to spread and propagate useful knowledge_ must teach some that they may teach others_ and so it is dispersed,20250223
That weak and timorous saints are comforted: So the poor_ who began to despair_ has hope. The experiences of some are encouragement to others to hope the best in the worst of times; for it is the glory of God to send help to the helpless and hope to the hopeless,20250223
That what he said should be easy_ and not dark and hard to be understood: My lips shall utterly knowledge clearly. Job shall readily comprehend his meaning_ and perceive what he aims at. Those that speak of the things of God should carefully avoid all obscurity and perplexedness both of notion and expression_ and speak as plainly and clearly as they can; for by that it will appear that they do themselves understand what they speak of_ that they mean honestly_ and design the edification of those they speak to,20250223
That what transgression and iniquity he had been guilty of (Who is there that lives and sins not?) he had always been ready to own it_ and_ as soon as ever he perceived he had said or done amiss_ he was ready to unsay it and undo it_ as far as he could_ by repentance_ confessing it both to God and man_ and forsaking it: this is doing honestly.,20250223
That whatever has become a snare to us and an occasion of sin_ though it be as a right eye and a right hand_ we must pluck it out_ cut it off_ and cast it from us_ must part with that which is dearest to us rather than hazard our own souls; this is our Saviour's command_ Matt. v. 28-30.,20250223
That when God restrains or rebukes us it is not because he is in danger from us or jealous of us (v. 4): __Will he reprove thee for fear of thee_ and take thee down from thy prosperity lest thou shouldst grow too great for him_ as princes sometimes have thought it a piece of policy to curb the growing greatness of a subject_ lest he should become formidable?__ Satan indeed suggested to our first parents that God forbade them the tree of knowledge for fear of them_ lest they should be as gods_ and so become rivals with him; but it was a base insinuation. God rebukes the good because he loves them_ but he never rebukes the great because he fears them. He does not enter into judgment with men_ that is_ pick a quarrel with them and seek occasion against them_ through fear lest they should eclipse his honour or endanger his interest. Magistrates punish offenders for fear of them. Pharaoh oppressed Israel because he feared them. It was for fear that Herod slew the children of Bethlehem and that the Jews persecuted Christ and his apostles. But God does not_ as they did_ pervert justice for fear of any. See ch. xxxv. 5-8.,20250223
That when God writes bitter things against us his design therein is to make us possess our iniquities_ to bring forgotten sins to mind_ and so to bring us to remorse for them as to break us off from them. This is all the fruit_ to take away our sin.,20250223
That when they have done so they lay the blame upon God_ and their hearts fret against him_ as if he had done them wrong_ whereas really they wrong themselves. In fretting_ we are enemies to our own peace_ and become self-tormentors; in fretting against the Lord we affront him_ his justice_ goodness_ and sovereignty; and it is very absurd to take occasion from the trouble which we pull upon our own heads by our wilfulness_ or neglect_ to quarrel with him_ when we ought to blame ourselves_ for it is our own doing. See Isa. l. 1.,20250223
That when we are in affliction it is our wisdom and duty to apply to God_ for he is able and ready to help us_ ver. 8-16.,20250223
That when we leave this world we leave the earth behind us_ that abides for ever where it is_ and therefore the things of the earth can stand us in no stead in the future state. It is well for mankind in general that the earth endures to the end of time_ when it and all the works in it shall be burnt up; but what is that to particular persons_ when they remove to the world of spirits? 3. That the condition of man is_ in this respect_ worse than that even of the inferior creatures: The earth abides for ever_ but man abides upon the earth but a little while. The sun sets indeed every night_ yet it rises again in the morning_ as bright and fresh as ever; the winds_ though they shift their point_ yet in some point or other still they are; the waters that go to the sea above ground come from it again under ground. But man lies down and rises not_ Job xiv. 7_ 12.,20250223
That when we speak touching the Almighty we must own that we cannot find him out; our finite understandings cannot comprehend his infinite perfections_ v,20250223
That which I see not_ teach thou me. Note_ A true penitent is willing to know the worst of himself; and we should all desire to know what our transgressions are_ that we may be particular in the confession of them and on our guard against them for the future.,20250223
That which crowned Job's prosperity was the pleasing prospect he had of the continuance of it. Though he knew_ in general_ that he was liable to trouble_ and therefore was not secure (ch. iii. 26_ I was not in safety_ neither had I rest)_ yet he had no particular occasion for fear_ but as much reason as ever any man had to count upon the lengthening out of his tranquility.,20250223
That which he aimed at was not to gratify his appetite_ but to find out man's happiness_ and this_ because it pretended to be so_ must be tried among the rest. Observe the description he gives of man's happiness—it is that good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all their days. ,20250223
That which he urges for this is very reasonable. ,20250223
That which is got by industry and honesty will grow more_ instead of growing less; it will be a maintenance; it will be an inheritance; it will be an abundance. He that labours_ working with his hands_ shall so increase as that he shall have to give to him that needs (Eph. iv. 28); and_ when it comes to that_ it will increase yet more and more.,20250223
That which is here set before us as the advantage of true wisdom is that it will make men's outward affairs prosperous and successful.  it will build a house and establish it_ v,20250223
That which is ill-got_ though it may increase much_ will not last long. A man may perhaps raise a great estate_ in a little time_ by usury and extortion_ fraud_ and oppression of the poor_ but it will not continue; he gathers it for himself_ but it shall prove to have been gathered for somebody else that he has no kindness for. His estate shall go to decay_ and another man's shall be raised out of the ruins of it,20250223
That which it is here condemned for is the mischievousness of it; it is in its power to ruin not only men's reputation_ but their lives_ estates_ families_ all that is dear to them. A false testimony is every thing that is dangerous; it is a maul (or club to knock a man's brains out with)_ a flail_ which there is no fence against; it is a sword to wound near at hand and a sharp arrow to wound at a distance; we have therefore need to pray_ Deliver my soul_ O Lord! from lying lips_ Ps. cxx. 2.,20250223
That which makes his case the more piteous is that he is not himself aware of his misery and danger; he goes blindfold_ nay_ he goes laughing to his ruin. The ox thinks he is led to the pasture when he is led to the slaughter; the fool (that is_ the drunkard_ for_ of all sinners_ drunkards are the greatest fools) is led to the correction of the stocks_ and is not sensible of the shame of it_ but goes to it as if he were going to a play. The bird that hastes to the snare looks only at the bait_ and promises herself a good bit from that_ and considers not that it is for her life. Thus this unthinking unwary young man dreams of nothing but the pleasures he shall have in the embraces of the harlot_ while really he is running headlong upon his ruin. Though Solomon does not here tell us that he put the law in execution against this base harlot_ yet we have no reason to think but that he did_ he was himself so affected with the mischief she did and had such an indignation at it.,20250223
That which may make us hate slothfulness and deceit_ for the word here_ as before_ signifies both: The slothful deceitful man has roast meat_ but that which he roasts is not what he himself took in hunting_ no_ it is what others took pains for_ and he lives upon the fruit of their labours_ like the drones in the hive. Or_ if slothful deceitful men have taken any thing by hunting (as sportsmen are seldom men of business)_ yet they do not roast it when they have taken it; they have no comfort in the enjoyment of it; perhaps God in his providence cuts them short of it,20250223
That which may make us in love with industry and honesty_ that the substance of a diligent man_ though it be not great perhaps_ is yet precious. It comes from the blessing of God; he has comfort in it; it does him good_ and his family. It is his own daily bread_ not bread out of other people's mouths_ and therefore he sees God gives it to him in answer to his prayer.,20250223
That which to us seems most unpleasant is yet_ in its proper time_ altogether becoming. Cold is as becoming in winter as heat in summer; and the night_ in its turn_ is a black beauty_ as the day_ in its turn_ is a bright one,20250223
That which was secret_ and lay hidden_ is strangely brought to light and laid open (v. 22): He discovers deep things out of darkness. Plots closely laid are discovered and defeated; wickedness closely committed and artfully concealed is discovered_ and the guilty are brought to condign punishment—secret treasons (Eccl. x. secret murders_ secret whoredoms. The cabinet-councils of princes are before God's eye_ 2 Kings vi. 11.,20250223
That which we are to enquire after is not so much the good we must have (we may leave that to God)_ but the good we must do; that ought to be our care. Good Master_ what good thing shall I do? Our happiness consists not in being idle_ but in doing aright_ in being well employed. If we do that which is good_ no doubt we shall have comfort and praise of the same. ,20250223
That wicked men do ill for themselves; they walk in a way which seduces them. It seems to them to be not only a pleasant way_ but the right way; it is so agreeable to flesh and blood that they therefore flatter themselves with an opinion that it cannot be amiss_ but they will not gain the point they aim at_ nor enjoy the good they hope for. It is all a cheat; and therefore the righteous is wiser and happier than his neighbour_ that yet despise him and trample upon him.,20250223
That wicked men were often thus ruined. For the proof of this he vouches his own observation,20250223
That wicked people are shameful people_ and bring contempt upon themselves_ for God has said that those who despise him shall be lightly esteemed. As soon as ever sin entered shame followed it_ and sinners make themselves despicable.,20250223
That will be an eternal farewell to winter and a joyful entrance upon an everlasting spring.,20250223
That wisdom often makes men very useful_ and yet gains them little respect_ for that persons of great merit are slighted_ ver. 13-18. And what is there then in this world that should make us fond of it?,20250223
That with God is terrible majesty. He is a God of glory and such transcendent perfection as cannot but strike an awe upon all his attendants and a terror upon all his adversaries. With God is terrible praise (so some)_ for he is fearful in praises_ Exod. xv,20250223
That yet affliction is the common lot of mankind_ ver.,20250223
That yet he could not long content himself with this_ but suddenly felt a powerful_ irresistible_ inclination in his own bosom to return to his church_ as his spouse_ being moved with her lamentations after him_ and her languishing desire towards him (v. 12): __Or ever I was aware_ my soul made me like the chariots of Ammi-nadib; I could not any longer keep at a distance; my repentings were kindled together_ and I presently resolved to fly back to the arms of my love_ my dove.__ Thus Joseph made himself strange to his brethren_ for a while_ to chastise them for their former unkindnesses_ and make trial of their present temper_ till he could no longer refrain himself_ but_ or ever he was aware_ burst out into tears_ and said_ I am Joseph_ Gen. xlv. 1_ 3. And now the spouse perceives_ as David did (Ps. xxxi. that though she said in her haste_ I am cut off from before thy eyes_ yet_ at the same time_ he heard the voice of her supplications_ and became like the chariots of Ammi-nadib_ which were noted for their beauty and swiftness. My soul put me into the chariots of my willing people (so some read it)_ __the chariots of their faith_ and hope_ and love_ their desires_ and prayers_ and expectations_ which they sent after me_ to fetch me back_ as chariots of fire with horses of fire.__ Note,20250223
That yet he had the tenderness of a comforter. He was as ready to succour those in distress as if it had been his office to comfort the mourners. Eliphaz himself owned he had been very good in that respect (ch. iv. 3): Thou hast strengthened the weak hands. And this he now reflected upon with pleasure_ when he was himself a mourner. But we find it easier to comfort others with the comforts wherewith we ourselves have been formerly comforted than to comfort ourselves with those comforts wherewith we have formerly comforted others.,20250223
That yet he shall be very safe. Whereas men's riches usually expose them to danger_ and he had owned that in his prosperity he was not in safety (ch. iii. now he might be secure; for the Almighty shall be thy defender; nay_ he shall be thy defence_ v,20250223
That yet there will be a return of man to life again in another world_ at the end of time_ when the heavens are no more. Then they shall awake and be raised out of their sleep. The resurrection of the dead was doubtless an article of Job's creed_ as appears_ ch. xix. 26_ and to that_ it should seem_ he has an eye here_ where_ in the belief of that_ we have three things:—,20250223
That_ all things considered_ our going out of the world is a great kindness to us than our coming into the world was: The day of death is preferable to the birth-day; though_ as to others_ there was joy when a child was born into the world_ and where there is death there is lamentation_ yet_ as to ourselves_ if we have lived so as to merit a good name_ the day of our death_ which will put a period to our cares_ and toils_ and sorrows_ and remove us to rest_ and joy_ and eternal satisfaction_ is better than the day of our birth_ which ushered us into a world of so much sin and trouble_ vanity and vexation. We were born to uncertainty_ but a good man does not die at uncertainty. The day of our birth clogged our souls with the burden of the flesh_ but the day of our death will set them at liberty from that burden.,20250223
That_ at length_ they are carried out of the world very silently and gently_ and without any remarkable disgrace or terror. __They go down to the grave as easily as snow-water sinks into the dry ground when it is melted by the sun;__ so bishop Patrick explains v,20250223
That_ being at peace with God_ there shall be a covenant of friendship between them and the whole creation_ v,20250223
That_ however_ they ought not to persecute him; if they would not ease his affliction by their pity_ yet they must not be so barbarous as to add to it by their censures and reproaches (v. 22): __Why do you persecute me as God? Surely his rebukes are enough for one man to bear; you need not add your wormwood and gall to the cup of affliction he puts into my hand_ it is bitter enough without that: God has a sovereign power over me_ and may do what he pleases with me; but do you think that you may do so too?__ No_ we must aim to be like the Most Holy and the Most Merciful_ but not like the Most High and Most Mighty. God gives not account of any of his matters_ but we must give account of ours. If they did delight in his calamity_ let them be satisfied with his flesh_ which was wasted and gone_ but let them not_ as if that were too little_ wound his spirit_ and ruin his good name. Great tenderness is due to those that are in affliction_ especially to those that are troubled in mind.,20250223
That_ if he were a true penitent_,20250223
That_ if truth be denied_ yet in time it will transpire. A lying tongue_ that puts false colours upon things_ is but for a moment. The lie will be disproved. The liar_ when he comes to be examined_ will be found in several stories_ and not consistent with himself as he is that speaks truth; and_ when he is found in a lie_ he cannot gain his point_ nor will he afterwards be credited. Truth may be eclipsed_ but it will come to light. Those therefore that make a lie their refuge will find it a refuge of lies.,20250223
That_ if truth be spoken_ it will hold good_ and_ whoever may be disobliged by it and angry at it_ yet it will keep its ground. Great is the truth and will prevail. What is true will be always true; we may abide by it_ and need not fear being disproved and put to shame,20250223
That_ on the contrary_ he would empower him to plead his own cause before God: __He would put strength in me_ to support me and bear me up_ in maintaining my integrity.__ Note_ The same power that is engaged against proud sinners is engaged for humble saints_ who prevail with God by strength derived from him_ as Jacob did_ Hos.,20250223
That_ though he differed in opinion from them_ yet he was not obstinate_ but ready to yield to conviction_ and to strike sail to truth as soon as ever it was made to appear to him that he was in an error (v. 24_ 25): __If_ instead of invidious reflections and uncharitable insinuations_ you will give me plain instructions and solid arguments_ which shall carry their own evidence along with them_ I am ready to acknowledge my error and own myself in a fault: Teach me_ and I will hold my tongue; for I have often found_ with pleasure and wonder_ how forcible right words are. But the method you take will never make proselytes: What doth your arguing reprove? Your hypothesis is false_ your surmises are groundless_ your management is weak_ and your application peevish and uncharitable.__ Note,20250223
That_ though he had been indeed in a fault_ yet they ought not to have given him such hard usage (v. 26_ 27): __Do you imagine_ or contrive with a great deal of art__ (for so the word signifies)_ __to reprove words_ some passionate expressions of mine in this desperate condition_ as if they were certain indications of reigning impiety and atheism? A little candour and charity would have served to excuse them_ and to put a better construction upon them. Shall a man's spiritual state be judged of by some rash and hasty words_ which a surprising trouble extorts from him? Is it fair_ is it kind_ is it just_ to criticize in such a case? Would you yourselves be served thus?__ Two things aggravated their unkind treatment of him:—1. That they took advantage of his weakness and the helpless condition he was in: You overwhelm the fatherless_ a proverbial expression_ denoting that which is most barbarous and inhuman. __The fatherless cannot secure themselves from insults_ which emboldens men of base and sordid spirits to insult them and trample upon them; and you do so by me.__ Job_ being a childless father_ thought himself as much exposed to injury as a fatherless child (Ps. cxxvii. 5) and had reason to be offended with those who therefore triumphed over him. Let those who overwhelm and overpower such as upon any account may be looked upon as fatherless know that therein they not only put off the compassions of man_ but fight against the compassions of God_ who is_ and will be_ a Father of the fatherless and a helper of the helpless,20250223
That_ though he had not the experience of an old man_ yet he had the understanding of a man_ ver. 6-10,20250223
That_ though it is fluid_ yet it is firm. It is strong_ and has its name from its stability. It still is what it was_ and suffers no decay_ nor shall the ordinances of heaven be altered till the lease expires with time,20250223
That_ though it is large_ it is bright and most curiously fine: It is a molten looking-glass_ smooth and polished_ and without the least flaw or crack. In this_ as in a looking-glass_ we may behold the glory of God and the wisdom of his handy work_ Ps. xix. 1. When we look up to heaven above we should remember it is a mirror or looking-glass_ not to show us our own faces_ but to be a faint representation of the purity_ dignity_ and brightness of the upper world and its glorious inhabitants.,20250223
That_ though now he was in a continual fear and terror_ he should live in a holy rest and security_ and find himself continually safe and easy (v. 18): Thou shalt be secure_ because there is hope. Note_ Those who have a good hope_ through grace_ in God_ and of heaven_ are certainly safe_ and have reason to be secure_ how difficult soever the times are through which they pass in this world. He that walks uprightly may thus walk surely_ because_ though there are trouble and danger_ yet there is hope that all will be well at last. Hope is an anchor of the soul_ Heb. vi,20250223
That_ though now he was slighted_ yet he should be courted: __Many shall make suit to thee_ and think it their interest to secure thy friendship.__ Suit is made to those that are eminently wise or reputed to be so_ that are very rich or in power. Zophar knew Job so well that he foresaw that_ how low soever this present ebb was_ if once the tide turned_ it would flow as high as ever; and he would be again the darling of his country. Those that rightly make suit to God will probably see the day when others will make suit to them_ as the foolish virgins to the wise_ Give us of your oil.,20250223
That_ though oppressors be high_ God is above them_ and in that very thing wherein they deal proudly_ Exod. xviii,20250223
That_ though oppressors be secure_ God has his eye upon them_ takes notice of_ and will reckon for_ all their violent perverting of judgment; he regards_ not only sees it but observes it_ and keeps it on record_ to be called over again; his eyes are upon their ways. See Job xxiv,20250223
That_ whatever is maliciously said against them_ it shall not affect them to do them any hurt_ v,20250223
That_ whatever troubles good men may be in_ there shall no evil touch them; they shall do them no real harm; the malignity of them_ the sting_ shall be taken out; they may hiss_ but they cannot hurt_ Ps. xci,20250223
That_ whatever vain knowledge a man may have in his head_ if he would be thought a wise man he must not utter it_ but let it die with himself as it deserves,20250223
That_ whatever was his character_ his case at present was very uncomfortable_ v,20250223
That_ when desolating judgments are abroad_ they shall be taken under special protection_,20250223
That_ when he looked up to God_ he had no just reason to speak thus despairingly: Judgment is before him_ that is_ __He knows what he has to do_ and will do all in infinite wisdom and justice; he has the entire plan and model of providence before him_ and knows what he will do_ which we do not_ and therefore we understand not what he does. There is a day of judgment before him_ when all the seeming disorders of providence will be set to rights and the dark chapters of it will be expounded. Then thou shalt see the full meaning of these dark events_ and the final period of these dismal events; then thou shalt see his face with joy; therefore trust in him_ depend upon him_ wait for him_ and believe that the issue will be good at last.__ When we consider that God is infinitely wise_ and righteous_ and faithful_ and that he is a God of judgment (Isa. xxx. we shall see no reason to despair of relief from him_ but all the reason in the world to hope in him_ that it will come in due time_ in the best time,20250223
That_ when they are sufficiently tried_ they shall come forth out of the furnace_ and not be left to consume in it as dross or reprobate silver. The trial will have an end. God will not contend for ever. ,20250223
That_ when we are once removed to another world_ we must never return to this. There is constant passing from this world to the other_ but vestigia nulla retrorsum—there is no repassing.,20250223

The Jews (who covet much to be wise above what is written) say that Job's wife was Dinah_ Jacob's daughter: so the Chaldee paraphrase. It is not likely that she was; but_ whoever it was_ she was to him like Michal to David_ a scoffer at his piety. She was spared to him_ when the rest of his comforts were taken away_ for this purpose_ to be a troubler and tempter to him. If Satan leaves any thing that he has permission to take away_ it is with a design of mischief. It is his policy to send his temptations by the hand of those that are dear to us_ as he tempted Adam by Eve and Christ by Peter. We must therefore carefully watch that we be not drawn to say or do a wrong thing by the influence_ interest_ or entreaty_ of any_ no_ not those for whose opinion and favour we have ever so great a value. Observe how strong this temptation was. 1. She banters Job for his constancy in his religion: __Dost thou still retain thy integrity? Art thou so very obstinate in thy religion that nothing will cure thee of it? so tame and sheepish as thus to truckle to a God who is so far from rewarding thy services with marks of his favour that he seems to take a pleasure in making thee miserable_ strips thee_ and scourges thee_ without any provocation given? Is this a God to be still loved_ and blessed_ and served?__,20250223
The Jews make these books to be given by a divine inspiration somewhat different from that both of Moses and the prophets. They divided the books of the Old Testament into the Law_ the Prophets and the ktwbym—Writings_ which Epiphanius emphatically translates grapheia—things written_ and these books are more commonly called among the Greeks Hagiographa—Holy writings: the Jews attribute them to that distinct kind of inspiration which they call rwh hqds—The Holy Spirit. Moses they supposed to write by the Spirit in a way above all the other prophets_ for with him God spoke mouth to mouth_ even apparently (Num. xii. 8) knew him_ that is_ conversed with him face to face_ Deut. xxxiv,20250223

The Lord here proceeds to ask Job many puzzling questions_ to convince him of his ignorance_ and so to shame him for his folly in prescribing to God. If we will but try ourselves with such interrogatories as these_ we shall soon be brought to own that what we know is nothing in comparison with what we know not. Job is here challenged to give an account of six things:—,20250223
The Lord not only is wise himself_ but he gives wisdom_ and that is more than the wisest men in the world can do_ for it is God's prerogative to open the understanding. All the wisdom that is in any creature is his gift_ his free gift_ and he gives it liberally (Jam. i. has given it to many_ and is still giving it; to him therefore let us apply for it.,20250223
The Lord will not do good_ neither will he do evil. Eliphaz shows the absurdity of this in one word_ and that is_ calling God the Almighty; for_ if he be so_ what cannot he do? But it is not strange if those cast off all religion who neither dread God's wrath nor desire his favour.,20250223

The absurdities this is compared to are_ taking away a garment from a man in cold weather_ which makes him colder_ and pouring vinegar upon nitre_ which_ like water upon lime_ puts it into a ferment; so improper_ so incongruous_ is it to sing pleasant songs to one that is of a sorrowful spirit. Some read it in a contrary sense: As he that puts on a garment in cold weather warms the body_ or as vinegar upon nitre dissolves it_ so he that sings songs of comfort to a person in sorrow refreshes him and dispels his grief.,20250223
The abundance of his heart was for God_ produced good things_ and suppressed the evil that was there_ which was out-voted by the better side. If he did think any evil_ yet he laid his hand upon his mouth (Prov. xxx. stifled the evil thought and let it go no further_ by which it appeared_ not only that he had true grace_ but that it was strong and victorious: in short_ that he had not forfeited the character of a perfect and upright man; for so he appears to be who_ in the midst of such temptations_ offends not in word_ Jam. iii. 2; Ps. xvii. 3.,20250223
The abundance of it which they promise themselves: We shall fill our houses with it. Those who trade with sin promise themselves mighty bargains_ and that it will turn to a vast account (All this will I give thee_ says the tempter); but they only dream that they eat; the housefuls dwindle into scarcely a handful_ like the grass on the house-tops.,20250223
The account he gives of himself and of the tour he had made. I come (says he) from going to and fro on the earth. 1. He could not pretend he had been doing any good_ could give no such account of himself as the sons of God could_ who presented themselves before the Lord_ who came from executing his orders_ serving the interest of his kingdom_ and ministering to the heirs of salvation,20250223

He that serves God uprightly will serve him continually.,20250223
The administration of public justice by the magistrate is an ordinance of God; in it the scales are held_ and ought to be held by a steady and impartial hand; and we ought to submit to it_ for the Lord's sake_ and to see his authority in that of the magistrate_ Rom. xiii. 1,20250223

The argument to enforce this exhortation is taken from the unspeakable advantage which wisdom_ thus kept_ will be of to us. 1. In respect of strength and satisfaction: __It will be life to thy soul (v. 22); it will quicken thee to thy duty when thou beginnest to be slothful and remiss; it will revive thee under thy troubles when thou beginnest to droop and despond. It will be thy spiritual life_ an earnest of life eternal.__ Life to the soul is life indeed,20250223
The arguments which Solomon here uses to enforce this caution are taken from the same topic with those before_ the many mischiefs which attend this sin. ,20250223
The ass has no den but his master's crib_ and thither he goes_ not only to be safe and warm_ but to be fed. Nature directs all creatures to shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man alone be unprovided with an ark?,20250223
The assurance he had of the divine presence (v. 5): The Almighty was yet with me. Now he thought God had departed from him_ but in those days he was with him_ and that was all in all to him. God's presence with a man in his house_ though it be but a cottage_ makes it both a castle and a palace.,20250223
The author of this grace is the Spirit_ and that is promised: I will pour out my Spirit unto you_ as oil_ as water; you shall have the Spirit in abundance_ rivers of living water_ John vii,20250223
The bad case of a vicious man_ who has not this rule over his own spirit_ who_ when temptations to excess in eating or drinking are before him_ has no government of himself_ when he is provoked breaks out into exorbitant passions_ such a one is like a city that is broken down and without walls. All that is good goes out_ and forsakes him; all that is evil breaks in upon him. He lies exposed to all the temptations of Satan and becomes an easy prey to that enemy; he is also liable to many troubles and vexations; it is likewise as much a reproach to him as it is to a city to have its walls ruined_ Neh. i. 3.,20250223
The bad conduct of a bad man; he puts a cheat upon himself. He does not rightly understand his way; he thinks he does_ and so misses his way_ and goes on in his mistake: The folly of fools is deceit; it cheats them into their own ruin. The folly of him that built on the sand was deceit.,20250223
The bad omen of a kingdom's ruin: Where no counsel is_ no consultation at all_ but every thing done rashly_ or no prudent consultation for the common good_ but only caballing for parties and divided interests_ the people fall_ crumble into factions_ fall to pieces_ fall together by the ears_ and fall an easy prey to their common enemies. Councils of war are necessary to the operations of war; two eyes see more than one; and mutual advice is in order to mutual assistance.,20250223
The bargain was that_ every one of the tenants having so much of the vineyard assigned him as would contain 1000 vines_ he was to pay the annual rent of 1000 pieces of silver; for we read (Isa. vii. 23) that in a fruitful soil there were 1000 vines at 1000 silverlings. Observe,20250223

The galleries for walking are of fir_ or cypress_ some sort of wood that was pleasing both to the sight and to the smell_ intimating the delight which the saints take in walking with Christ and conversing with him. Every thing in the covenant of grace (on which foot all their treaties are carried on) is very firm_ very fine_ and very fragrant.,20250223

The belly is like a heap of wheat in the store-chamber_ which perhaps was sometimes_ to make show_ adorned with flowers. The wheat is useful_ the lilies are beautiful; there is every thing in the church which may be to the members of that body either for use or for ornament. All the body is nourished from the belly; it denotes the spiritual prosperity of a believer and the healthful constitution of the soul all in good plight,20250223
The benefit and praise of wisdom_ ver. 1.,20250223
The benefit of a holy caution. It sounds strangely_ but it is very true: Happy is the man that feareth always. Most people think that those are happy who never fear; but there is a fear which is so far from having torment in it that it has in it the greatest satisfaction. Happy is the man who always keeps up in his mind a holy awe and reverence of God_ his glory_ goodness_ and government_ who is always afraid of offending God and incurring his displeasure_ who keeps conscience tender and has a dread of the appearance of evil_ who is always jealous of himself_ distrustful of his own sufficiency_ and lives in expectation of troubles and changes_ so that_ whenever they come_ they are no surprise to him. He who keeps up such a fear as this will live a life of faith and watchfulness_ and therefore happy is he_ blessed and holy,20250223
The benefit of due correction. They must not only tell their children what is good and evil_ but they must chide them_ and correct them too_ if need be_ when they either neglect that which is good or do that which is evil. If a reproof will serve without the rod_ it is well_ but the rod must never be used without a rational and grave reproof; and then_ though it may be a present uneasiness both to the father and to the child_ yet it will give wisdom. Vexatio dat intellectum—Vexation sharpens the intellect. The child will take warning_ and so will get wisdom,20250223
The benefit of parting with it_ both by a penitent confession and a universal reformation: He that confesses his guilt to God_ and is careful not to return to sin again_ shall find mercy with God_ and shall have the comfort of it in his own bosom. His conscience shall be eased and his ruin prevented. See 1 John i. 9; Jer. iii. 12_ 13. When we set sin before our face (as David_ My sin is ever before me) God casts it behind his back.,20250223
The benefit of that business enquired into: What profit has a man of all that labour? Solomon says (Prov. xiv.,20250223
The benefit of wisdom and consideration: A prudent man_ by the help of his prudence_ will foresee an evil_ before it comes_ and hide himself; he will be aware when he is entering into a temptation and will put on his armour and stand on his guard. When the clouds are gathering for a storm he takes the warning_ and flies to the name of the Lord as his strong tower. Noah foresaw the deluge_ Joseph the years of famine_ and provided accordingly,20250223
The best men_ and those that do most good_ yet cannot say that they are perfectly free from sin; even those that are sanctified are not sinless. None that live on this side of heaven live without sin. If we say_ We have not sinned_ we deceive ourselves. ,20250223
The best reputation is that which attends virtue and serious piety_ and the prudent conduct of life: A man shall be commended by all that are wise and good_ in conformity to the judgment of God himself_ which we are sure is according to truth_ not according to his riches or preferments_ his craft and subtlety_ but according to his wisdom_ the honesty of his designs and the prudent choice of means to compass them,20250223

The blessing of the Lord makes rich; it is he that gives us power to get wealth and gives success in honest endeavours. Those therefore that would thrive must have an eye to God's blessing_ and never to out of it_ no_ not into the warm sun; and those that have thriven must not sacrifice to their own net_ but acknowledge their obligations to God for his blessing,20250223
The blood settled_ and the sores suppurated and by degrees scabbed over_ which made his skin look black. Even his garment had its colour changed with the continual running of his boils_ and the soft clothing he used to wear had now grown so stiff that all his garments were like his collar_ v,20250223
The body is made as the clay (v. cast into shape_ into this shape_ as the clay is formed into a vessel_ according to the skill and will of the potter. We are earthen vessels_ mean in our original_ and soon broken in pieces_ made as the clay. Let not therefore the thing formed say unto him that formed it_ Why hast thou made me thus? We must not be proud of our bodies_ because the matter is from the earth_ yet not dishonour our bodies_ because the mould and shape are from the divine wisdom. The formation of human bodies in the womb is described by an elegant similitude (v. 10_ Thou hast poured me out like milk_ which is coagulated into cheese)_ and by an induction of some particulars_ v,20250223
The books here put together are poetical. Job is an heroic poem_ the book of Psalms a collection of divine odes or lyrics_ Solomon's Song a pastoral and an epithalamium; they are poetical_ and yet sacred and serious_ grave and full of majesty. They have a poetic force and flame_ with out poetic fury and fiction_ and strangely command and move the affections_ without corrupting the imagination or putting a cheat upon it; and_ while they gratify the ear_ they edify the mind and profit the more by pleasing. It is therefore much to be lamented that so powerful an art_ which was at first consecrated to the honour of God_ and has been so often employed in his service_ should be debauched_ as it has been_ and is at this day_ into the service of his enemies—that his corn_ and wine_ and oil should be prepared for Baal.,20250223
The books of scripture have hitherto been mostly historical_ but now the matter is of another nature; it is doctrinal and devotional_ preaching and praying; and in this way of writing_ as well as in the former_ a great deal of excellent knowledge is conveyed_ which serves very valuable purposes. It will be of good use to know not only what others did that went before us_ and how they fared_ but what their notions and sentiments were_ what their thoughts and affections were_ that we may_ with the help of them_ form our minds aright. Plutarch's Morals are reputed as a useful treasure in the commonwealth of learning as Plutarch's Lives_ and the wise disquisitions and discourses of the philosophers as the records of the historians; nor is this divine philosophy (if I may so call it)_ which we have in these books_ less needful_ nor less serviceable_ to the church_ than the sacred history was. Blessed be God for both.,20250223

The bride_ the church_ speaks to the bridegroom (ver. 2-4)_ to the daughters of Jerusalem (ver. 5_ and then to the bridegroom_ ver. 7.,20250223
The bridegroom's resolution hereupon to retire to the mountain of myrrh (v. 6) and there to make his residence. This mountain of myrrh is supposed to signify Mount Moriah_ on which the temple was built_ where incense was daily burnt to the honour of God. Christ was so pleased with the beauty of his church that he chose this to be his rest for ever; here he will dwell till the day break and the shadows flee away. Christ's parting promise to his disciples_ as the representatives of the church_ answer to this: Lo_ I am with you always_ even to the end of the world. Where the ordinances of God are duly administered there Christ will be_ and there we must meet him at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. Some make these to be the words of the spouse_ either modestly ashamed of the praises given her_ and willing to get out of the hearing of them_ or desirous to be constant to the holy hill_ not doubting but there to find suitable and sufficient succour and relief in all her straits_ and there to cast anchor_ and wish for the day_ which_ at the time appointed_ would break and the shadows flee away. The holy hill (as some observe) is here called both a mountain of myrrh_ which is bitter_ and a hill of frankincense_ which is sweet_ for there we have occasion both to mourn and rejoice; repentance is a bitter sweet. But in heaven it will be all frankincense_ and no myrrh. Prayer is compared to incense_ and Christ will meet his praying people and will bless them.,20250223
The bright ornaments of heaven are the work of his hands (v. 13): By his Spirit_ the eternal Spirit that moved upon the face of the waters_ the breath of his mouth (Ps. xxxiii. he has garnished the heavens_ not only made them_ but beautified them_ has curiously bespangled them with stars by night and painted them with the light of the sun by day. God_ having made man to look upward (Os homini sublime dedit—To man he gave an erect countenance)_ has therefore garnished the heavens_ to invite him to look upward_ that_ by pleasing his eye with the dazzling light of the sun and the sparkling light of the stars_ their number_ order_ and various magnitudes_ which_ as so many golden studs_ beautify the canopy drawn over our heads_ he may be led to admire the great Creator_ the Father and fountain of lights_ and to say_ __If the pavement be so richly inlaid_ what must the palace be! If the visible heavens be so glorious_ what are those that are out of sight!__ From the beauteous garniture of the ante-chamber we may infer the precious furniture of the presence-chamber. If stars be so bright_ what are angels! What is meant here by the crooked serpent which his hands have formed is not certain. Some make it part of the garnishing of the heavens_ the milky-way_ say some; some particular constellation_ so called_ say others. It is the same word that is used for leviathan (Isa. xxvii. 1)_ and probably may be meant of the whale or crocodile_ in which appears much of the power of the Creator; and why may not Job conclude with that inference_ when God himself does so? ch. xli.,20250223
The burden of the song is still the same: This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. It is vanity_ at the best_ even to the good man; when he has all that the sinner has scraped together it will not make him happy without something else; but it is vexation of spirit to the sinner to see what he had laid up enjoyed by him that is good in God's sight_ and therefore evil in his. So that_ take it which way you will_ the conclusion is firm_ All is vanity and vexation of spirit.,20250223
The business of this world described. It is labour; the word signifies both care and toil. It is work that wearies men. There is a constant fatigue in worldly business. It is labour under the sun; that is a phrase peculiar to this book_ where we meet with it twenty-eight times. There is a world above the sun_ a world which needs not the sun_ for the glory of God is its light_ where there is work without labour and with great profit_ the work of angels; but he speaks of the work under the sun_ the pains of which are great and the gains little. It is under the sun_ under the influence of the sun_ by its light and in its heat; as we have the benefit of the light of the day_ so we have sometimes the burden and heat of the day (Matt. xx. and therefore in the sweat of our face we eat bread. In the dark and cold grave the weary are at rest. ,20250223
The call that Christ gave to her_ when she was under this indisposition: It is the voice of my beloved; she knew it to be so_ and was soon aware of it_ which was a sign that her heart was awake. Like the child Samuel_ she heard at the first call_ but did not_ like him_ mistake the person; she knew it to be the voice of Christ. He knocks_ to awaken us to come and let him in_ knocks by his word and Spirit_ knocks by afflictions and by our own consciences; though this is not expressly quoted_ yet probably it is referred to (Rev. iii.,20250223
The call that is given to the daughters of Zion to acquaint themselves with the glories of king Solomon: Go forth_ and behold him. The multitude of the spectators adds to the beauty of a splendid cavalcade. Christ_ in his gospel_ manifests himself. Let each of us add to the number of those that give honour to him_ by giving themselves the satisfaction of looking upon him. Who should pay respects to Zion's king but Zion's daughters? They have reason to rejoice greatly when he comes_ Zec. ix,20250223
The care God takes of man_ and the various ways and means he uses to do his soul good_ which we have reason to think he designs when he lays bodily afflictions upon him_ ver,20250223
The care which divine Providence takes of the people_ to prevent this danger_ that the hypocrite reign not_ either that he do not reign at all or that he do not reign long. If God has mercy in store for a people_ he will either prevent the rise or hasten the ruin of hypocritical rulers.,20250223
The cause and consequence of melancholy. It is heaviness in the heart; it is a load of care_ and fear_ and sorrow_ upon the spirits_ depressing them_ and disabling them to exert themselves with any vigour on what is to be done or fortitude in what is to borne; it makes them stoop_ prostrates and sinks them. Those that are thus oppressed can neither do the duty nor take the comfort of any relation_ condition_ or conversation. Those therefore that are inclined to it should watch and pray against it,20250223
The cause of injustice. Men refuse to do judgment; they will not render to all their due_ but withhold it_ and omissions make way for commissions; they come at length to robbery itself. Those that refuse to do justice will choose to do wrong,20250223
The caution and circumspection of a good man: As for the upright_ he does not say_ What would I do? What have I a mind to? and that will I have; but_ What should I do? What does God require of me? What is duty? What is prudence? What is for edification? And so he does not force his way_ but direct his way by a safe and certain rule.,20250223
The caution given is much the same with that which we had before (ch. xxiii. not to envy sinners_ not to think them happy_ nor to wish ourselves in their condition_ though they prosper ever so much in this world_ and are ever so marry and ever so secure. __Let not such a thought ever come into thy mind_ O that I could shake off the restraints of religion and conscience_ and take as great a liberty to indulge the sensual appetite_ as I see such and such do! No; desire not to be with them_ to do as they do and fare as they fare_ and to cast in thy lot among them.__ 2. Here is another reason given for this caution: __Be not envious against them_ not only because their end will be had_ but because their way is so_ v,20250223
The caution itself is very pressing: __Remove thy way far from her; if thy way should happen to lie near her_ and thou shouldst have a fair pretence of being led by business within the reach of her charms_ yet change thy way_ and alter the course of it_ rather than expose thyself to danger; come not nigh the door of her house; go on the other side of the street_ nay_ go through some other street_ though it be about.__ This intimates_ ,20250223
The caution itself_ and that is to abstain from fleshly lusts_ from adultery_ fornication_ and all uncleanness. Some apply this figuratively_ and by the adulterous woman here understand idolatry_ or false doctrine_ which tends to debauch men's minds and manners_ or the sensual appetite_ to which it may as fitly as any thing be applied; but the primary scope of it is plainly to warn us against seventh-commandment sins_ which youth is so prone to_ the temptations to which are so violent_ the examples of which are so many_ and which_ where admitted_ are so destructive to all the seeds of virtue in the soul that it is not strange that Solomon's cautions against it are so very pressing and so often repeated. Solomon here_ as a faithful watchman_ gives fair warning to all_ as they regard their lives and comforts_ to dread this sin_ for it will certainly be their ruin. Two things we are here warned to take heed of:—,20250223
The caution she gives him against those two destroying sins of uncleanness and drunkenness_ which_ if he allowed himself in them_ would certainly be his ruin. 1. Against uncleanness (v. 3): Give not thy strength unto women_ unto strange women. He must not be soft and effeminate_ nor spend that time in a vain conversation with the ladies which should be spent in getting knowledge and despatching business_ nor employ that wit (which is the strength of the soul) in courting and complimenting them which he should employ about the affairs of his government. __Especially shun all adultery_ fornication_ and lasciviousness_ which waste the strength of the body_ and bring into it dangerous diseases. Give not thy ways_ thy affections_ thy conversation_ to that which destroys kings_ which has destroyed many_ which gave such a shock to the kingdom even of David himself_ in the matter of Uriah. Let the sufferings of others be thy warnings.__ It lessens the honour of kings and makes them mean. Are those fit to govern others that are themselves slaves to their own lusts? It makes them unfit for business_ and fills their court with the basest and worst of animals. Kings lie exposed to temptations of this kind_ having wherewith both to please the humours and to bear the charges of the sin_ and therefore they ought to double their guard; and_ if they would preserve their people from the unclean spirit_ they must themselves be patterns of purity. Meaner people may also apply it to themselves. Let none give their strength to that which destroys souls,20250223
The cautions_ counsels_ and commands which our parents gave us agree with the word of God_ and therefore we must hold them fast. Children_ when they are grown up_ must remember the law of a good mother_ as well as the commandment of a good father_ Ecclesiasticus iii,20250223
The changes and extremities of the weather_ wet or dry_ hot or cold_ are the subject of a great deal of our common talk and observation; but how seldom do we think and speak of these things_ as Elihu does here_ with an awful regard to God the director of them_ who shows his power and serves the purposes of his providence by them! We must take notice of the glory of God_ not only in the thunder and lightning_ but in the more common revolutions of the weather_ which are not so terrible and which make less noise. As_,20250223
The character and fate of a malicious mischievous man_ ver. 12-15.,20250223
The character of a fool: He trusts to his own heart_ to his own wisdom and counsels_ his own strength and sufficiency_ his own merit and righteousness_ and the good opinion he has of himself; he that does so is a fool_ for he trusts to that_ not only which is deceitful above all things (Jer. xvii. but which has often deceived him. This implies that it is the character of a wise man (as before_ v. 25) to put his trust in the Lord_ and in his power and promise_ and to follow his guidance_ Prov. iii. 5_ 6,20250223
The character of a good governor: He is a king that deserves to be called so who sits in the throne_ not as a throne of honour_ to take his ease_ and take state upon him_ and oblige men to keep their distance_ but as a throne of judgment_ that he may do justice_ give redress to the injured and punish the injurious_ who makes his business his delight and loves no pleasure comparably to it_ who does not devolve the whole care and trouble upon others_ but takes cognizance of affairs himself and sees with his own eyes as much as may be_ 1 Kings x. 9,20250223
The character of a good king_ which Solomon intended not for his own praise_ but for instruction to his successors_ his neighbours_ and the viceroys under him. A good king not only does justice_ but it is an abomination to him to do otherwise. He hates the thought of doing wrong and perverting justice; he not only abhors the wickedness done by others_ but abhors the wickedness done by others_ but abhors to do any himself_ though_ having power_ he might easily and safety do it,20250223
The character of one that is marked for ruin: He that despises the word of God_ and has no regard to it_ no veneration for it_ nor will be ruled by it_ certainly he shall be destroyed_ for he slights that which is the only means of curing a destructive disease and makes himself obnoxious to that divine wrath which will certainly be his destruction. Those that prefer the rules of carnal policy before divine precepts_ and the allurements of the world and the flesh before God's promises and comforts_ despise his word_ giving the preference to those things that stand in competition with it; and it is to their own just destruction: they would not take warning,20250223
The character of one that is sure to be happy: He that fears the commandment_ that stands in awe of God_ pays a deference to his authority_ has a reverence for his word_ is afraid of displeasing God and incurring the penalties annexed to the commandment_ shall not only escape destruction_ but shall be rewarded for his godly fear. In keeping the commandment there is great reward.,20250223
The character of oppressors is very bad_ so some understand v,20250223
The charge which Christ gives to his servants to oppose and suppress that which is a terror to his church and drives her_ like a poor frightened dove_ into the clefts of the rock_ and which is an obstruction and prejudice to the interests of his kingdom in this world and in the heart (v. 15): Take us the foxes (take them for us_ for it is good service both to Christ and the church)_ the little foxes_ that creep in insensibly; for_ though they are little_ they do great mischief_ they spoil the vines_ which they must by no means be suffered to do at any time_ especially now when our vines have tender grapes that must be preserved_ or the vintage will fail. Believers are as vines_ weak but useful plants; their fruits are as tender crops at first_ which must have time to come to maturity. This charge to take the foxes is,20250223
The chief butler drinks wine in bowls_ but makes nothing of the afflictions of Joseph. Wealth without grace often makes men thus haughty_ thus careless of their poor neighbours. ,20250223
The church admires Jesus Christ under the person of Solomon_ his bed_ and the life-guards about it (ver. 7_ his chariot_ ver. 9_ 10. She calls upon the daughters of Zion_ who were admiring her_ to admire him rather_ especially as he appeared on his coronation day and the day of his nuptials_ ver. 11.,20250223
The church directs them where they may meet with him_ ver. 2_ 3.,20250223
The church expresses her value for Christ_ and returns esteem (v. 16): Behold_ thou art fair. See how Christ and believers praise one another. Israel saith of God_ Who is like thee? Exod.,20250223
The church expresses the great value she has for Christ_ and the delights she takes in communion with him_ ver. 12-14.,20250223
The church is here pleasing herself exceedingly with the thoughts of her further communion with Christ after she has recovered from her fainting fit.,20250223
The church returns the commendation_ ver. 16_ 17. Where there is a fire of true love to Christ in the heart this will be of use to blow it up into a flame.,20250223
The church shall be delivered from her persecutors_ in due time; though now she dwells among lions (Ps. lvii.,20250223
The church speaks,20250223
The church's breasts are both for ornament (Ezek. xvi. 7) and for use; they are the breasts of her consolation ( Isa. lxvi. as she is said to suck the breasts of kings_ Isa. lx,20250223
The church_ that enjoys the privileges of the vineyard_ must have them always before her. The keeping of the vineyard requires constant care and diligence. They are rather the words of the spouse: My vineyard_ which is mine_ is before me. She has lamented her fault and folly in not keeping her own vineyard (ch. i. but now she resolves to reform. Our hearts are our vineyards_ which we must keep with all diligence; and therefore we must have a watchful jealous eye upon them at all times,20250223
The city of God on earth is made glad with the river that flows from this fountain (Ps. xlvi. and the new Jerusalem has its pure river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb_ Rev. xxii. 1.,20250223
The clouds pour down according to the vapour that they draw up_,20250223
The coals thereof_ its lamps_ and flames_ and beams_ are very strong_ and burn with incredible force_ as the coals of fire that have a most vehement flame_ a flame of the Lord (so some read it)_ a powerful piercing flame_ as the lightning_ Ps. xxix,20250223
The cock in the fable knew not the value of the precious stone he found in the dunghill_ and therefore would rather have lighted on a barley-corn. Men know not the worth of grace_ and therefore will take no pains to get it,20250223
The comfort and satisfaction which we sometimes have in communion with God in grace here should make us breathe the more earnestly after the immediate vision and complete fruition of him in the kingdom of glory. The spouse_ after an endearing conference with her beloved_ finding it must break off_ concludes with this affectionate request for the perfecting and perpetuating of this happiness in the future state. The clusters of grapes that meet us in this wilderness should make us long for the full vintage in Canaan. If a day in his courts be so sweet_ what then will an eternity within the veil be! If this be heaven_ O that I were there! 5. It is good to conclude our devotions with a joyful expectation of the glory to be revealed_ and holy humble breathings towards it. We should not part but with the prospect of meeting again. It is good to conclude every sabbath with thoughts of the everlasting sabbath_ which shall have no night at the end of it_ nor any week-day to come after it. It is good to conclude every sacrament with thoughts of the everlasting feast_ when we shall sit down with Christ at his table in his kingdom_ to rise no more_ and drink of the wine new there_ and to break up every religious assembly in hopes of the general assembly of the church of the first-born_ when time and days shall be no more: Let the blessed Jesus hasten that blessed day. Why are his chariot-wheels so long a coming? Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?,20250223
The comfort of a good king: His throne is established by righteousness. He that makes conscience of using his power aright shall find that to be the best security of his government_ both as it will oblige people_ make them easy_ and keep them in the interest of it_ and as it will obtain the blessing of God_ which will be a firm basis to the throne and a strong guard about it.,20250223
The comfort of a wise man: He that walks wisely_ that trusts not to his own heart_ but is humble and self-diffident_ and goes on in the strength of the Lord God_ he shall be delivered; when the fool_ that trusts in his own heart_ shall be destroyed.,20250223
The comfort of bad men withering and dying: The lamp of the wicked burns dimly and faint; it looks melancholy_ like a taper in an urn_ and it will shortly be put out in utter darkness_ Isa. l,20250223
The comfort of good men flourishing and lasting: The light of the righteous rejoices_ that is_ it increases_ and makes them glad. Even their outward prosperity is their joy_ and much more those gifts_ graces_ and comforts_ with which their souls are illuminated; these shine more and more_ ch. iv,20250223
The comfort of the people of God is the honour of the nation in which they live. There is a great glory dwelling in the land when the righteous do rejoice_ when they have their liberty_ the free exercise of their religion_ and are not persecuted_ when the government countenances them and speaks comfortably to them_ when they prosper and grow rich_ and_ much more_ when they are preferred and employed and have power put into their hands,20250223
The comfortable condition of a godly man when he finishes his course: He has hope in his death of a happiness on the other side death_ of better things in another world than ever he had in this. The righteous then have the grace of hope in them; though they have pain_ and some dread of death_ yet they have hope. They have before them the good hoped for_ even the blessed hope which God_ who cannot lie_ has promised.,20250223
The comfortable words of encouragement which he gives him thus to accommodate himself to his condition_ and (as he himself had expressed it) to receive evil at the hand of God_ and not despise it as a gift not worth the accepting.,20250223
The command teaches us our duty __Curse not the king_ no_ not in thy thought_ do not wish ill to the government in thy mind.__ All sin begins there_ and therefore the first risings of it must be curbed and suppressed_ and particularly that of treason and sedition. __Curse not the rich_ the princes and governors_ in thy bed-chamber_ in a conclave or club of persons disaffected to the government; associate not with such; come not into their secret; join not with them in speaking ill of the government or plotting against it.__ 2. The reason consults our safety. __Though the design be carried on ever so closely_ a bird of the air shall carry the voice to the king_ who has more spies about than thou art aware of_ and that which has wings shall tell the matter_ to thy confusion and ruin.__ God sees what men do_ and hears what they say_ in secret; and_ when he pleases_ he can bring it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. Wouldst thou then not be hurt by the powers that be_ nor be afraid of them? Do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same; but_ if thou do that which is evil_ be afraid_ Rom. xiii. 3_ 4.,20250223
The commendation of religion: it is wisdom and understanding. To be truly religious is to be truly wise. As the wisdom of God appears in the institution of religion_ so the wisdom of man appears in the institution of religion_ so the wisdom of man appears in the practice and observance of it. It is understanding_ for it is the best knowledge of truth; it is wisdom_ for it is the best management of our affairs. Nothing more surely guides our way and gains our end than being religious.,20250223
The common proverb says_ __An ounce of mirth is worth a pound of sorrow;__ but the preacher teaches us a contrary lesson: Sorrow is better than laughter_ more agreeable to our present state_ where we are daily sinning and suffering ourselves_ more or less_ and daily seeing the sins and sufferings of others. While we are in a vale of tears_ we should conform to the temper of the climate. It is also more for our advantage; for_ by the sadness that appears in the countenance_ the heart is often made better. Note,20250223
The communion he had with the divine word (v. 4): The secret of God was upon my tabernacle_ that is_ God conversed freely with him_ as one bosom-friend with another. He knew God's mind_ and was not in the dark about it_ as_ of late_ he had been. The secret of the Lord is said to be with those that fear him_ for he shows them that in his covenant which others see not_ Ps. xxv,20250223
The communion which a gracious soul has with all the saints in this communion with Christ. In the chambers to which we are brought we not only meet with him_ but meet with one another (1 John i. 7); for the upright love thee; the congregation_ the generation_ of the upright love thee. Whatever others do_ all that are Israelites indeed_ and faithful to God_ will love Jesus Christ. Whatever differences of apprehension and affection there may be among Christians in other things_ this they are all agreed in_ Jesus Christ is precious to them. The upright here are the same with the virgins_ v,20250223
The complacency he had in the divine favour (v. 3): God's candle shone upon his head_ that is_ God lifted up the light of his countenance upon him_ gave him the assurances and sweet relishes of his love. The best of the communications of the divine favour to the saints in this world is but the candle-light_ compared with what is reserved for them in the future state. But such abundant satisfaction did Job take in the divine favour that_ by the light of that_ he walked through darkness; that guided him in his doubts_ comforted him in his griefs_ bore him up under his burdens_ and helped him through all his difficulties. Those that have the brightest sun-shine of outward prosperity must yet expect some moments of darkness. They are sometimes crossed_ sometimes at a loss_ sometimes melancholy. But those that are interested in the favour of God_ and know how to value it_ can_ by the light of that_ walk cheerfully and comfortably through all the darkness of this vale of tears. That puts gladness into the heart enough to counterbalance all the grievances of this present time,20250223
The complacency which Christ takes in his church thus beautified and adorned. She is lovely indeed if she be so in his eyes; as he puts the comeliness upon her_ so it is his love that makes this comeliness truly valuable_ for he is an unexceptionable judge. 1. He delighted to look upon his church_ and to converse with it_ rejoicing in that habitable part of his earth: The king is held in the galleries_ and cannot leave them. This is explained by Ps. cxxxii. 13_ 14_ The Lord has chosen Zion_ saying_ This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell; and Ps. cxlvii. 11_ The Lord takes pleasure in those that fear him. And_ if Christ has such delight in the galleries of communion with his people_ much more reason have they to delight in them_ and to reckon a day there better than a thousand.,20250223
The complaint he makes of his afflictions_ which he here aggravates_ and (as we are all too apt to do) makes the worst of_ in three expressions:—,20250223
The condition and character of those is every way better who content themselves in a lower sphere_ where they are despised for the plainness of their dress and the meanness of their post_ that they may be able to afford themselves_ not only necessaries_ but conveniences_ in their own houses_ not only bread_ but a servant to attend them and take some of their work off their hands. Those that contrive to live plentifully and comfortably at home are to be preferred before those that affect nothing so much as to appear splendid abroad_ though they have not wherewithal to maintain their appearance_ whose hearts are unhumbled when their condition is low.,20250223
The conies_ or_ as some rather understand it_ the Arabian mice_ field mice_ weak creatures_ and very timorous_ yet they have so much wisdom as to make their houses in the rocks_ where they are well guarded_ and their feebleness makes them take shelter in those natural fastnesses and fortifications. Sense of our own indigence and weakness should drive us to him that is a rock higher than we for shelter and support; there let us make our habitation,20250223
The consciousness of atrocious crimes astonishes and confounds.,20250223
The consolations of God are not in themselves small. Divine comforts are great things_ that is_ the comfort which is from God_ especially the comfort which is in God. ,20250223
The consolations of God not being small in themselves_ it is very lamentable if they be small with us. It is a great affront to God_ and an evidence of a degenerate depraved mind_ to disesteem and undervalue spiritual delights and despise the pleasant land. __What!__ (says Eliphaz) __is there any secret thing with thee? Hast thou some cordial to support thyself with_ that is a proprium_ an arcanum_ that nobody else can pretend to_ or knows any thing of?__ Or_ __Is there some secret sin harboured and indulged in thy bosom_ which hinders the operation of divine comforts?__ None disesteem divine comforts but those that secretly affect the world and the flesh.,20250223
The conversion of Lydia is represented by the opening of her heart (Acts xvi. 14) and Christ is said to open his disciples' understandings_ Luke xxiv,20250223
The counsel she gives him to do good. 1. He must do good with his wealth. Great men must not think that they have their abundance only that out of it they may made provision for the flesh_ to fulfil the lusts of it_ and may the more freely indulge their own genius; no_ but that with it they may relieve such as are in distress_ v. 6_ 7. __Thou hast wine or strong drink at command; instead of doing thyself hurt with it_ do others good with it; let those have it that need it.__ Those that have wherewithal must not only give bread to the hungry and water to the thirsty_ but they must give strong drink to him that is ready to perish through sickness or pain and wine to those that are melancholy and of heavy heart; for it was appointed to cheer and revive the spirits_ and make glad the heart (as it does where there is need of it)_ not to burden and oppress the spirits_ as it does where there is no need of it. We must deny ourselves in the gratifications of sense_ that we may have to spare for the relief of the miseries of others_ and be glad to see our superfluities and dainties better bestowed upon those whom they will be a real kindness to than upon ourselves whom they will be a real injury to. Let those that are ready to perish drink soberly_ and it will be a means so to revive their drooping spirits that they will forget their poverty for the time and remember their misery no more_ and so they will be the better able to bear it. The Jews say that upon this was grounded the practice of giving a stupifying drink to condemned prisoners when they were going to execution_ as they did to our Saviour. But the scope of the place is to show that wine is a cordial_ and therefore to be used for want and not for wantonness_ by those only that need cordials_ as Timothy_ who is advised to drink a little wine_ only for his stomach's sake and his often infirmities_ 1 Tim. v. 23,20250223
The crime is recited and it is highly provoking. See what it is for which judgment will be given against impenitent sinners in the great day_ and you will say they deserve it_ and the Lord is righteous in it. It is_ in short_ rejecting Christ and the offers of his grace_ and refusing to submit to the terms of his gospel_ which would have saved them both from the curse of the law of God and from the dominion of the law of sin. ,20250223
The cure of it: A good word from God_ applied by faith_ makes it glad; such a word is that (says one of the rabbin)_ Cast thy burden upon the Lord_ and he shall sustain thee; the good word of God_ particularly the gospel_ is designed to make the hearts glad that are weary and heavy-laden_ Matt. xi,20250223
The curse may work silently and slowly; but it is as a fretting leprosy; it will consume the timber thereof and the stones thereof_ Zech. v. 4; Hab. ii,20250223
The cursed arts which a vile adulterer has to debauch a maid_ and to persuade her to yield to his wicked and abominable lust. This is what a wanton poet wrote a whole book of_ long since_ De arte amandi—On the art of love. By what pretensions and protestations of love_ and all its powerful charms_ promises of marriage_ assurances of secresy and reward_ is many an unwary virgin brought to sell her virtue_ and honour_ and peace_ and soul_ and all to a base traitor; for so all sinful lust is in the kingdom of love. The more artfully the temptation is managed the more watchful and resolute ought every pure heart to be against it. ,20250223
The cursed arts which a vile adulteress has to conceal her wickedness_ especially from her husband_ from whom she treacherously departs; so close are her intrigues with her lewd companions_ and so craftily disguised_ that it is as impossible to discover her as to track an eagle in the air. She eats the forbidden fruit_ after the similitude of Adam's transgression_ and then wipes her mouth_ that it may not betray itself_ and with a bold and impudent face says_ I have done no wickedness. ,20250223
The curses and blessings were read with a loud voice by the Levites_ Deut. xxvii,20250223
The danger of a sinful presumption: He that hardens his heart_ that mocks at fear_ and sets God and his judgments at defiance_ and receives not the impressions of his word or rod_ shall fall into mischief; his presumption will be his ruin_ and whatever sin (which is the greatest mischief) he falls into it is owing to the hardness of his heart.,20250223
The danger of this disease. It is in a manner desperate: There is more hope of a fool_ that knows and owns himself to be such_ than of such a one. Solomon was not only a wise man himself_ but a teacher of wisdom; and this observation he made upon his pupils_ that he found his work most difficult and least successful with those that had a good opinion of themselves and were not sensible that they needed instruction. Therefore he that seems to himself to be wise must become a fool_ that he may be wise_ 1 Cor. iii,20250223
The danger that attends this sin. He that robs and oppresses the poor does it at his peril; for,20250223
The danger that there is in the beginning of strife. One hot word_ one peevish reflection_ one angry demand_ one spiteful contradiction_ begets another_ and that a third_ and so on_ till it proves like the cutting of a dam; when the water has got a little passage it does itself widen the breach_ bears down all before it_ and there is then no stopping it_ no reducing it,20250223
The danger the people are in when hypocrites reign. They are likely to be ensnared in sin_ or trouble_ or both. Power_ in the hands of dissemblers_ is often destructive to the rights and liberties of a people_ which they are more easily wheedled out of than forced out of. Much mischief has been done likewise to the power of godliness under the pretence of a form of godliness. ,20250223
The darkness of the night is as welcome to the labourer as the light of the morning is to the watchman_ Ps. cxxx,20250223
The daughters of Jerusalem admire the excellencies of the church_ ver. 6.,20250223
The daughters of Jerusalem stood admiring the spouse and commending her_ but she overlooks their praises_ is not puffed up with them_ but transfers all the glory to Christ_ and directs them to look off from her to him_ recommends him to their esteem_ and sets herself to applaud him. Here he is three times called Solomon_ and we have that name but three times besides in all this song_ ch. i. 5; viii. 11_ 12. It is Christ that is here meant_ who is greater than Solomon_ and of whom Solomon was an illustrious type for his wisdom and wealth_ and especially his building the temple.,20250223
The daughters of Jerusalem_ moved with the description which the church had given of Christ_ enquire after him_ ver. 1.,20250223
The day of death will be a day of wrath. It is a messenger of God's wrath; therefore when Moses had meditated on man's mortality he takes occasion thence to admire the power of God's anger_ Ps. cx,20250223
The decays and infirmities of old age are here elegantly described in figurative expressions_ which have some difficulty in them to us now_ who are not acquainted with the common phrases and metaphors used in Solomon's age and language; but the general scope is plain—to show how uncomfortable_ generally_ the days of old age are. First_ Then the sun and the light of it_ the moon and the stars_ and the light which they borrow from it_ will be darkened. They look dim to old people_ in consequence of the decay of their sight; their countenance is clouded_ and the beauty and lustre of it are eclipsed; their intellectual powers and faculties_ which are as lights in the soul_ are weakened; their understanding and memory fail them_ and their apprehension is not so quick nor their fancy so lively as it has been; the days of their mirth are over (light is often put for joy and prosperity) and they have not the pleasure either of the converse of the day or the repose of the night_ for both the sun and the moon are darkened to them. Secondly_ Then the clouds return after the rain; as_ when the weather is disposed to wet_ no sooner has one cloud blown over than another succeeds it_ so it is with old people_ when they have got free from one pain or ailment_ they are seized with another_ so that their distempers are like a continual dropping in a very rainy day. The end of one trouble is_ in this world_ but the beginning of another_ and deep calls unto deep. Old people are often afflicted with defluxions of rheum_ like soaking rain_ after which still more clouds return_ feeding the humour_ so that it is continually grievous_ and therein the body_ as it were_ melts away. Thirdly_ Then the keepers of the house tremble. The head_ which is as the watch-tower_ shakes_ and the arms and hands_ which are ready for the preservation of the body_ shake too_ and grow feeble_ upon every sudden approach and attack of danger. That vigour of the animal spirits which used to be exerted for self-defence fails and cannot do its office; old people are easily dispirited and discouraged. Fourthly_ Then the strong men shall bow themselves; the legs and thighs_ which used to support the body_ and bear its weight_ bend_ and cannot serve for travelling as they have done_ but are soon tired. Old men that have been in their time strong men become weak and stoop for age_ Zech. viii,20250223
The defendant is ready to make his appearance and to give his accusers all the fair play they can desire. He will declare unto them the number of his steps_ v,20250223
The depth of the adversity into which he had fallen; and this he does to move the pity of his friends_ and to justify_ or at least excuse_ his own complaints. But then_,20250223
The description here given of the leviathan_ a very large_ strong_ formidable fish_ or water-animal_ is designed yet further to convince Job of his own impotency_ and of God's omnipotence_ that he might be humbled for his folly in making so bold with him as he had done.,20250223
The description of a charitable man; he has a bountiful eye_ opposed to the evil eye (ch. xxiii. 6) and the same with the single eye (Matt. vi. 22)_—an eye that seeks out objects of charity_ besides those that offer themselves_—an eye that_ upon the sight of one in want and misery_ affects the heart with compassion_—an eye that with the alms gives a pleasant look_ which makes the alms doubly acceptable. He has also a liberal hand: He gives of his bread to those that need—his bread_ the bread appointed for his own eating. He will rather abridge himself than see the poor perish for want; yet he does not give all his bread_ but of his bread; the poor shall have their share with his own family,20250223
The description of a virtuous woman_ especially in the relation of a wife and the mistress of a family_ which Lemuel's mother drew up_ not as an encomium of herself_ though_ no doubt_ it was her own true picture_ but either as an instruction to her daughters_ as the foregoing verses were to her son_ or as a direction to her son in the choice of a wife; she must be chaste and modest_ diligent and frugal_ dutiful to her husband_ careful of her family_ discreet in her discourse_ and in the education of her children_ and_ above all_ conscientious in her duty to God: such a one as this_ if he can find her_ will make him happy_ ver. 10-31.,20250223
The description of true religion_ pure religion_ and undefiled; it is to fear the Lord and depart from evil_ which agrees with God's character of Job_ ch. i. 1. The fear of the Lord is the spring and summary of all religion. There is a slavish fear of God_ springing from hard thoughts of him_ which is contrary to religion_ Matt. xxv,20250223
The design God has_ in bringing his people into such distresses as these; it is for the benefit of their souls_ the consideration of which should reconcile us to affliction and make us think well of it. Three things God intends when he afflicts us:—,20250223
The design of this observation is to show,20250223
The designing busy part of mankind are directed_ in all their counsels and undertakings_ to have their eye to God_ and to believe,20250223
The designs of the crafty are to ruin the poor. Tongue_ and hand_ and sword_ and all_ are at work in order to this; but God takes under his special protection those who_ being poor and unable to help themselves_ being his poor and devoted to his praise_ have committed themselves to him. He saves them from the mouth that speaks hard things against them and the hand that does hard things against them; for he can_ when he pleases_ tie the tongue and wither the hand. The effect of this is (v. 16),20250223
The designs of the wicked against the righteous_ and the success they promise themselves in those designs. The plot is laid deeply: They lay wait against the dwelling of the righteous_ thinking to charge some iniquity upon it_ or compass dome design against it; they lie in wait at the door_ to catch him when he stirs out_ as David's persecutors_ Ps. lix. title. The hope is raised high; they doubt not but to spoil his dwelling-place because he is weak and cannot support it_ because his condition is low and distressed_ and he is almost down already. All this is a fruit of the old enmity in the seed of the serpent against the seed of the woman. The blood-thirsty hate the upright,20250223
The desire of the slothful_ which should be his excitement_ is his torment_ which should make him busy_ makes him always uneasy_ and is really a greater toil to him than labour would be,20250223
The desires of the soul find nothing in the wealth of the world to give them any satisfaction. The soul is not filled_ so the word is. When God gave Israel their request he sent leanness into their souls_ Ps. cvi,20250223
The desolation which the wicked ones make of religion and the religious; though it comes_ and seems to be just at the door_ yet be not afraid of it; for_ though God may make use of the wicked as instruments of his people's correction_ yet he will never suffer them to be the authors of their desolation. Or rather_ ,20250223
The desolation which wicked men will be brought into in a moment. It will come_ and timorous saints may be apprehensive that they shall be involved in it; but let this be their comfort_ that though judgments lay waste generally_ at least promiscuously_ yet God knows who are his and how to separate between the precious and the vile. Therefore be not afraid of that which appears most formidable_ for (v. 26) __the Lord shall be not only thy protector to keep thee safe_ but thy confidence to keep thee secure_ so that thy foot shall not be taken by thy enemies nor ensnared by thy own fears.__ God has engaged to keep the feet of his saints.,20250223
The desperate condition of a wicked man when he goes out of the world: He is driven away in his wickedness. He cleaves so closely to the world that he cannot find in his heart to leave it_ but is driven away out of it; his soul is required_ is forced from him_ And sin cleaves so closely to him that it is inseparable; it goes with him into another world; he is driven away in his wickedness_ dies in his sins_ under the guilt and power of them_ unjustified_ unsanctified. His wickedness is the storm in which he is hurried away_ as chaff before the wind_ chased out of the world,20250223
The devil had done all he desired leave to do against Job_ to provoke him to curse God. He had touched all he had_ touched it with a witness; he whom the rising sun saw the richest of all the men in the east was before night poor to a proverb. If his riches had been_ as Satan insinuated_ the only principle of his religion now that he had lost his riches he would certainly have lost his religion; but the account we have_ in these verses_ of his pious deportment under his affliction_ sufficiently proved the devil a liar and Job an honest man.,20250223
The devil is a roaring lion; and they partake of his nature_ and do his lusts. They are strong as lions_ and subtle (Ps. x. 9; xvii. 12); and_ as far as they prevail_ they lay all desolate about them. ,20250223
The devil_ having got leave to tear and worry poor Job_ presently fell to work with him_ as a tormentor first and then as a tempter. His own children he tempts first_ and draws them to sin_ and afterwards torments_ when thereby he has brought them to ruin; but this child of God he tormented with an affliction_ and then tempted to make a bad use of his affliction. That which he aimed at was to make Job curse God; now here we are told what course he took both to move him to it and move it to him_ both to give him the provocation_ else he would not have thought of it: thus artfully in the temptation managed with all the subtlety of the old serpent_ who is here playing the same game against Job that he played against our first parents (Gen. iii.)_ aiming to seduce him from his allegiance to his God and to rob him of his integrity.,20250223
The difficulty of meeting with such a one: Who can find her? This intimates that good women are very scarce_ and many that seem to be so do not prove so; he that thought he had found a virtuous woman was deceived; Behold_ it was Leah_ and not the Rachel he expected. But he that designs to marry ought to seek diligently for such a one_ to have this principally in his eye_ in all his enquiries_ and to take heed that he be not biassed by beauty or gaiety_ wealth or parentage_ dressing well or dancing well; for all these may be and yet the woman not be virtuous_ and there is many a woman truly virtuous who yet is not recommended by these advantages,20250223
The dignity of it; it is the song of songs_ a most excellent song_ not only above any human composition_ or above all other songs which Solomon penned_ but even above any other of the scripture-songs_ as having more of Christ in it,20250223
The disappointment of his expectation is here compared to the confusion which seizes the poor travellers when they find heaps of sand where they expected floods of water. In the winter_ when they were not thirsty_ there was water enough. Every one will applaud and admire those that are full and in prosperity. But in the heat of summer_ when they needed water_ then it failed them; it was consumed,20250223
The discourse itself. He here aims to show,20250223
The dishonour put upon him by his persecutors. Some apply it to the crown of thorns with which his mother_ the Jewish church_ crowned him on the day of his death_ which was the day of his espousals to his church_ when he loved it_ and gave himself for it (Eph. v. 25); and it is observable that when he was brought forth wearing the crown of thorns Pilate said_ and said it to the daughters of Zion_ Behold the man. ,20250223
The displeasure of God against them. Whether they be about the money or the goods_ in the buyer or in the seller_ they are all alike an abomination to the Lord. He will not prosper the trade that is thus driven_ nor bless what is thus got. He hates those that thus break the common faith by which justice is maintained_ and will be the avenger of all such.,20250223
The distinction in the Hebrew between the small rain and the great rain is this_ that the former is called a shower of rain_ the latter of rains_ many showers in one; but all are the showers of his strength: the power of God is to be observed as much in the small rain that soaks into the earth as in the great rain that batters on the house-top and washes away all before it. Note_ The providence of God is to be acknowledged_ both by husbandmen in the fields and travellers upon the road_ in every shower of rain_ whether it does them a kindness of a diskindness. It is sin and folly to contend with God's providence in the weather; if he send the snow or rain_ can we hinder them? Or shall we be angry at them? It is as absurd to quarrel with any other disposal of Providence concerning ourselves or ours. The effect of the extremity of the winter-weather is that it obliges both men and beasts to retire_ making it uncomfortable and unsafe for them to go abroad.,20250223
The distress supposed (v. 8): If they be bound in fetters_ laid in prison as Joseph was_ or holden in the cords of any other affliction_ confined by pain and sickness_ hampered by poverty_ bound in their counsels_ and_ notwithstanding all their struggles_ held long in this distress. This was Job's case; he was caught_ and kept fast_ in the cords of anguish (as some read it); but observe_ ,20250223
The divine Providence orders and directs those things which to us are perfectly casual and fortuitous. Nothing comes to pass by chance_ nor is an event determined by a blind fortune_ but every thing by the will and counsel of God. What man has neither eye nor hand in God is intimately concerned in,20250223
The doctrine of God's justice laid down_ ver. 2.,20250223
The doom of a false witness. He who_ for favour to one side or malice to the other_ gives in a false evidence_ or makes an affidavit of that which he knows to be false_ or at least does not know to be true_ if it be discovered_ his reputation will be ruined. A man may tell a lie perhaps in his haste; but he that gives a false testimony does it with deliberation and solemnity_ and it cannot but be a presumptuous sin_ and a forfeiture of man's credit. But_ though he should not be discovered_ he himself shall be ruined; the vengeance he imprecated upon himself_ when he took the false oath_ will come upon him,20250223
The doom of seducers_ who attempt to draw good people_ or those who profess to be such_ into sin and mischief_ who take pride in causing the righteous to go astray in an evil way_ in drawing them into a snare_ that they may insult over them. They shall not gain their point; it is impossible to deceive the elect. But they shall fall themselves into their own pit; and having been not only sinners_ but tempters_ not only unrighteous_ but enemies to the righteous_ their condemnation will be so much the greater_ Matt. xxiii. 14_ 15,20250223
The doom of the shedder of blood. He that has committed murder_ though he flees for his life_ shall be continually haunted with terrors_ shall himself flee to the pit_ betray himself_ and torment himself_ like Cain_ who_ when he had killed his brother_ became a fugitive and a vagabond_ and trembled continually,20250223
The doom passed upon all those that reject Wisdom and her proposals_ v,20250223
The doves' eyes are within the locks_ which area as a shade upon them_ so that_,20250223
The dragon fights_ but is cast out_ Rev. xii,20250223
The dream be to those that hate thee. Job was so far from indulging himself in any wicked way_ and flattering himself in it_ that_ if he might have leave to wish the greatest evil he could think of to the worst enemy he had in the world_ he would wish him the portion of a wicked man_ knowing that worse he could not wish him. Not that we may lawfully wish any man to be wicked_ or that any man who is not wicked should be treated as wicked; but we should all choose to be in the condition of a beggar_ an out-law_ a galley-slave_ any thing_ rather that in the condition of the wicked_ though in ever so much pomp and outward prosperity.,20250223
The duty of charity described. It includes two things:—1. Compassion_ which is the inward principle of charity in the heart; it is to have pity on the poor. Those that have not a penny for the poor_ yet may have pity for them_ a charitable concern and sympathy; and_ if a man give all his goods to feed the poor and have not this charity in his heart_ it is nothing_ 1 Cor. xiii,20250223
The duty of magistrates_ and that is_ to judge faithfully between man and man_ and to determine all causes brought before them_ according to truth and equity_ particularly to take care of the poor_ not to countenance them in an unjust cause for the sake of their poverty (Exod. xxiii.,20250223
The duty of the avenger of blood_ whether the magistrate or the next of kin_ or whoever are concerned in making inquisition for blood_ let them be close and vigorous in the prosecution_ and let it not be bought off. Those that acquit the murderer_ or do any thing to help him off_ come in sharers in the guilt of blood; nor can the land be purged from blood but by the blood of him that shed it_ Num. xxxv. 33.,20250223
The eagle_ a royal bird_ and yet a bird of prey too_ the permission of which_ nay_ the giving of power to which_ may help to reconcile us to the prosperity of oppressors among men. The eagle is here taken notice of_ ,20250223
The ear of the judicious tries words_ whether what is said be true or false_ right or wrong_ and he that speaks must stand the test of the intelligent. As we must prove all things we hear_ so we must be willing that what we speak should be proved,20250223
The earth is where it was; the sun_ and winds_ and rivers_ keep the same course that ever they did; and therefore_ if they have never yet been sufficient to make a happiness for man_ they are never likely to be so_ for they can but yield the same comfort that they have yielded. We must therefore look above the sun for satisfaction_ and for a new world,20250223
The earth will rise up against him (as the stomach rises against that which is loathsome)_ and will no longer keep him. The heaven reveals his iniquity_ and therefore will not receive him. Whither then must he go but to hell? If the God of heaven and earth be his enemy_ neither heaven nor earth will show him any kindness_ but all the hosts of both are and will be at war with him.,20250223
The effects of injustice; it will return upon the sinner's own head. The robbery of the wicked will terrify them (so some); their consciences will be filled with horror and amazement_ will cut them_ will saw them asunder (so others); it will destroy them here and for ever_ therefore he had said (v.,20250223
The encouragement of charity. 1. A very kind construction shall be put upon it. What is given to the poor_ or done for them_ God will place it to account as lent to him_ lent upon interest (so the word signifies); he takes it kindly_ as if it were done to himself_ and he would have us take the comfort of it and to be as well pleased as ever any usurer was when he had let out a sum of money into good hands,20250223
The encouraging invitation which Christ gives to the church_ and every believing soul_ to come into communion with him_ v. 14.,20250223
The end and design of these admonitions that are sent. 1. To keep men from sin_ and particularly the sin of pride (v. 17). That he may withdraw man from his purpose_ that is_ from his evil purposes_ may change the temper of his mind and the course of his life_ his disposition and inclination_ or prevent some particular sin he is in danger of falling into_ that he may withdraw man from his work_ may make him leave off man's work_ which is working for the world and the flesh_ and may set him to work the work of God. Many a man has been stopped in the full career of a sinful pursuit by the seasonable checks of his own conscience_ saying_ Do not this abominable thing which the Lord hates. Particularly_ God does_ by this means_ hide pride from man_ that is_ hide those things from him which are the matter of his pride_ and take his mind off from dwelling upon them_ by setting before him what reason he has to be humble. That he may take away pride from man (so some read it)_ that he may pluck up that root of bitterness which is the cause of so much sin. All those whom God has mercy in store for he will humble and hide pride from. Pride makes people eager and resolute in the prosecution of their purposes; they will have their way_ therefore God withdraws them from their purposes_ by mortifying their pride,20250223
The end of both_ to an eye of sense_ seems alike too: They have all one breath_ and breathe in the same air_ and it is the general description of both that in their nostrils is the breath of life (Gen. vii. and therefore_ as the one dies_ so dies the other; in their expiring there is no visible difference_ but death makes much the same change with a beast that it does with a man. ,20250223
The end of it_ and that is utter destruction. Such_ so miserable_ are the dwellings of the wicked. Vengeance will be taken of those that know not God_ 2 Thess. i,20250223
The end of sinners will be everlasting shame_ the end of saints endless honour_ v,20250223
The enquiry of the daughters of Jerusalem concerning the amiable perfections of her beloved (ver. and her particular answer to that enquiry_ ver. 10-16. __Unto you that believe he is thus precious.__,20250223
The enquiry which the daughters of Jerusalem made concerning Christ_ v. 1. They still continue their high thoughts of the church_ and call her_ as before_ the fairest among women; for true sanctity is true beauty. And now they raise their thoughts higher concerning Christ: Whither has thy beloved gone_ that we may seek him with thee? This would be but an indecent_ unacceptable_ compliment_ if the song were not to be understood spiritually; for love is jealous of a rival_ would monopolize the beloved_ and cares not that others should join in seeking him; but those that truly love Christ are desirous that others should love him too_ and be joined to him; nay_ the greatest instance of duty and respect that the church's children can show to their mother is to join with her in seeking Christ. The daughters of Jerusalem_ who had asked (ch. v.,20250223
The equity of a good God. The Master_ or Lord (so Rab signifies)_ or_ as we read it_ The great God that formed all things at first_ and still governs them in infinite wisdom_ renders to every man according to his work. He rewards the fool_ who sinned through ignorance_ who knew not his Lord's will_ with few stripes; and he rewards the transgressor_ who sinned presumptuously and with a high hand_ who knew his Lord's will and would not do it_ with many stripes. Some understand it of the goodness of God's common providence even to fools and transgressors_ on whom he causes his sun to shine and his rain to fall. Or_ 2. The iniquity of a bad prince (so the margin reads it): A great man grieves all_ and he hires the fool; he hires also the transgressors. When a wicked man gets power in his hand_ by himself_ and by the fools and knaves whom he employs under him_ whom he hires and chooses to make use of_ he grieves all who are under him and is vexatious to them. We should therefore pray for kings and all in authority_ that_ under them_ our lives may be quiet and peaceable.,20250223
The events concerning both seem much alike (v. 19); That which befals the sons of men is no other than that which befals beasts; a great deal of knowledge of human bodies is gained by the anatomy of the bodies of brutes. When the deluge swept away the old world the beasts perished with mankind. Horses and men are killed in battle with the same weapons of war. ,20250223
The everlasting mountains were scattered_ Hab. iii,20250223
The evil one toucheth not God's children_ 1 John v,20250223
The excellency of his discourse: __It is my wisdom_ my understanding; if I undertake to teach thee wisdom I cannot prescribe any thing to be more properly called so; moral philosophy is my philosophy_ and that which is to be learned in my school.__ 2. The usefulness of it: __Attend to what I say___ ,20250223
The excuse she made to put off her compliance with this call (v. 3): I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on again? She is half asleep; she knows the voice of her beloved; she knows his knock_ but cannot find in her heart to open to him. She was undressed_ and would not be at the pains to dress herself again; she had washed her feet_ and would not have occasion to wash them again. She could not send another to open the door (it must be our own act and deed to let Christ into our hearts)_ and yet she was loth to go herself; she did not say_ I will not open_ but_ How shall I? Note_ Frivolous excuses are the language of prevailing slothfulness in religion; Christ calls to us to open to him_ but we pretend we have no mind_ or we have no strength_ or we have no time_ and therefore think we may be excused_ as the sluggard that will not plough by reason of cold. And those who ought to watch for the Lord's coming with their loins girt_ if they ungird themselves and put off their coat_ will find it difficult to recover their former resolution and to put it on again; it is best therefore to keep tight. Making excuses (Luke xiv. 18) is interpreted making light of Christ (Matt. xxii. and so it is. Those put a great contempt upon Christ that cannot find in their hearts to bear a cold blast for him_ or get out of a warm bed.,20250223
The execution of this sentence is often delayed a great while_ and the sinner goes on_ not only unpunished_ but prosperous and successful. ,20250223
The explication of his oath (v. 5_ 6): __God forbid that I should justify you in your uncharitable censures of me_ by owning myself a hypocrite: no_ until I die I will not remove my integrity from me; my righteousness I hold fast_ and will not let it go.__ 1. He would always be an honest man_ would hold fast his integrity_ and not curse God_ as Satan_ by his wife_ urged him to do_ ch. ii,20250223
The eye of the adulteress did so_ Prov. vii,20250223
The eyes are compared to the fish-pools in Heshbon_ or the artificial fish-ponds_ by a gate_ either of Jerusalem or Heshbon_ which is called Bath-rabbim_ the daughter of a multitude_ because a great thoroughfare.,20250223
The eyes grow unruly and behold strange women to lust after them_ and so let in adultery into the heart. Est Venus in vinis—Wine is oil to the fire of lust. Thy eyes shall behold strange things (so some read it); when men are drunk the house turns round with them_ and every thing looks strange to them_ so that them they cannot trust their own eyes. ,20250223
The eyes that have been wilfully shut against the grace of God shall be opened to see his destruction. He shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty; that shall be the portion of his cup. Compare Ps. xi. 6 with Rev. xiv,20250223
The fair warning and good counsel he gives to Job thereupon_ ver. 16-21.,20250223
The fat that covers his face makes him look bold and haughty_ and that which covers his flanks makes him lie easy and soft_ and feel little; but this will prove poor shelter against the darts of God's wrath. ,20250223
The fatherless are taken under God's special protection; with him they not only find mercy shown to them (Hos. xiv. 3) but justice done for them. He is their Redeemer_ their Goël_ their near kinsman_ that will take their part and stand up for them with jealousy_ as taking himself affronted in the injuries done to them. As their Redeemer he will plead their cause against those that do them any injury_ and_ one way or other_ will not only defend their right_ and recover it for them_ but avenge the wrongs done to them. And he is mighty_ almighty; his omnipotence is engaged and employed for their protection_ and their proudest and most powerful oppressors will not only find themselves an unequal match for this_ but will find that it is at their peril to contend with it,20250223
The fatherless that had none to help them found Job ready to help them_ and_ if they were in straits_ to deliver them. He helped them to make the best of what little they had_ helped them to pay what they owed and to get in what was owing to them_ helped them out into the world_ helped them into business_ helped them to it_ and helped them in it; thus should the fatherless be helped. ,20250223
The fear of God reigning in his heart was the principle that governed his whole conversation. This made him perfect and upright_ inward and entire for God_ universal and uniform in religion; this kept him close and constant to his duty. He feared God_ had a reverence for his majesty_ a regard to his authority_ and a dread of his wrath,20250223
The fear of the Lord is said to be health to the navel. See Prov. iii.,20250223
The fear of the Lord is to hate evil (Prov. viii. 13) and then by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil_ Prov. xvi. 6.,20250223
The felicity of a people that have not only a settled_ but a successful ministry among them_ the people that hear and keep the law_ among whom religion is uppermost; happy are such a people and every particular person among them. It is not having the law_ but obeying it_ and living up to it_ that will entitle us to blessedness.,20250223
The fig tree putteth forth her green figs_ and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise_ my love_ my fair one_ and come away.,20250223
The fig-tree puts forth her green figs_ by which we know that summer is nigh (Matt. xxiv. when the green figs will be ripe figs and fit for use; and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. The earth produces not only flowers (v. but fruits; and the smell of the fruits_ which are profitable_ is to be preferred far before that of the flowers_ which are only for show and pleasure. Serpents_ they say_ are driven away by the smell of the vines; and who is the old serpent_ and who the true vine_ we know very well.,20250223
The fire he is consumed by is a fire not blown_ kindled without noise_ a consumption which every body sees the effect of_ but nobody sees the cause of. It is plain that the gourd is withered_ but the worm at the root_ that causes it to wither_ is out of sight. He is wasted by a soft gentle fire—surely_ but very slowly. When the fuel is very combustible_ the fire needs no blowing_ and that is his case; he is ripe for ruin. The proud_ and those that do wickedly_ shall be stubble_ Mal. iv. 1. An unquenchable fire shall consume him (so some read it)_ and that is certainly true of hell-fire.,20250223
The fire_ which_ when it has consumed abundance of fuel_ yet still devours all the combustible matter that is thrown into it. So insatiable are the corrupt desires of sinners_ and so little satisfaction have they even in the gratification of them.,20250223
The first instance of the vanity of man's knowledge_ and all the parts of learning_ especially natural philosophy and politics. Observe,20250223
The first principle of it recommended to our serious consideration_ ver. 7-9.,20250223
The first sin began in the eye_ Gen. iii,20250223
The flakes of it are joined so closely together_ and are so firm_ that it is hard to pierce it; he is as if he were all bone. His flesh is of brass_ which Job had complained his was not_ ch. vi,20250223
The flame shall dry them up_ v he shall shake them off as blossoms that never knit_ or as the unripe grape_ v,20250223
The flash of fire_ and the noise it makes in a watery cloud_ are really at the same time; but_ because the motion of light is much quicker than that of sound_ we see the lightning some time before we hear the thunder_ as we see the firing of a great gun at a distance before we hear the report of it. The thunder is here called the voice of God's excellency_ because by it he proclaims his transcendent power and greatness. He sends forth his voice and that a mighty voice_ Ps. lxviii,20250223
The flower is fading_ and all its beauty soon withers and is gone. The shadow is fleeting_ and its very being will soon be lost and drowned in the shadows of the night. Of neither do we make any account; in neither do we put any confidence.,20250223
The flowers appear on the earth. All winter they are dead and buried in their roots_ and there is no sign of them; but in the spring they revive_ and show themselves in a wonderful variety and verdure_ and_ like the dew that produces them_ tarry not for man_ Mic. v,20250223
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come_ and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land,20250223
The flowing forth of the soul after Christ_ and its ready compliance with him_ are the effect of his grace; we could not run after him if he did not draw us_ 2 Cor. iii. 5; Phil. iv,20250223
The flowing forth of the spices of grace depends upon the gales of the Spirit; he stirs up good affections_ and works in us both to will and to do that which is good; it is he that makes manifest the savour of his knowledge by us. ,20250223
The folly and frustration of these designs ,20250223
The folly of drunkards is easily inferred thence. He that is deceived thereby_ that suffers himself to be drawn into this sin when he is so plainly warned of the consequences of it_ is not wise; he shows that he has no right sense or consideration of things; and not only so_ but he renders himself incapable of getting wisdom; for it is a sin that infatuates and besots men_ and takes away their heart. A drunkard is a fool_ and a fool he is likely to be.,20250223
The folly of hoarding up abundance of worldly wealth_ ver. 7_ 8.,20250223
The folly of indulging sin_ of palliating and excusing it_ denying or extenuating it_ diminishing it_ dissembling it_ or throwing the blame of it upon others: He that thus covers his sins shall not prosper_ let him never expect it. He shall not succeed in his endeavour to cover his sin_ for it will be discovered_ sooner or later. There is nothing hid which shall not be revealed. A bird of the air shall carry the voice. Murder will out_ and so will other sins. He shall not prosper_ that is_ he shall not obtain the pardon of his sin_ nor can he have any true peace of conscience. David owns himself to have been in a constant agitation while he covered his sins_ Ps. xxxii. 3_ 4. While the patient conceals his distemper he cannot expect a cure,20250223
The folly of passion. It makes men scatter causeless curses_ wishing ill to others upon presumption that they are bad and have done ill_ when either they mistake the person or misunderstand the fact_ or they call evil good and good evil. Give honour to a fool_ and he thunders out his anathemas against all that he is disgusted with_ right or wrong. Great men_ when wicked_ think they have a privilege to keep those about them in awe_ by cursing them_ and swearing at them_ which yet is an expression of the most impotent malice and shows their weakness as much as their wickedness,20250223
The folly of those that will not be taught_ that refuse instruction_ that will not heed it_ but turn their backs upon it_ or will not hear it_ but turn their hearts against it. They refuse correction (margin); they will not take it_ no_ not from God himself_ but kick against the pricks. Those that do so despise their own souls; they show that they have a low and mean opinion of them_ and are in little care and concern about them_ considered as rational and immortal_ instruction being designed to cultivate reason and prepare for the immortal state. The fundamental error of sinners is undervaluing their own souls; therefore they neglect to provide for them_ abuse them_ expose them_ prefer the body before the soul_ and wrong the soul to please the body,20250223
The fool foldeth his hands together_ and eateth his own flesh. 6 Better is a handful with quietness_ than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.,20250223
The foolish man known not how to go to the city (Eccl. x. and therefore Wisdom stands ready to direct him_ stands at the gates_ at the entry of the city_ ready to tell him where the seer's house is_ 1 Sam. ix,20250223
The foolish virgins will beg oil of the wise. ,20250223
The foolishness which is bound in the heart of a child may be driven out by the rod of correction_ for then the mind is to be moulded_ the vicious habits not having taken root; but here he shows that_ if it be not done then_ it will be next to impossible to do it afterwards; if the disease be inveterate_ there is a danger of its being incurable. Can the Ethiopian change his skin? Observe,20250223
The foregoing verse showed how much our reputation_ this how much our health_ depends on the good government of our passions and the preserving of the temper of the mind. 1. A healing spirit_ made up of love and meekness_ a hearty_ friendly_ cheerful disposition_ is the life of the flesh; it contributes to a good constitution of body; people grow fat with good humour,20250223
The former part of this verse speaks of thoughts_ the latter of words_ but they come all to one; for thoughts are words to God_ and words are judged of by the thoughts from which they proceed_ so that,20250223
The foundations of the earth are of his establishing. He founded it at first; he upholds it still. If Christ had not interposed_ the foundations of the earth would have sunk under the load of the curse upon the ground_ for man's sin. Who and what is the mighty He that does all this? We cannot find out God_ nor the Son of God_ unto perfection. Oh the depth of that knowledge!,20250223
The froward sinners_ who are continually going from-ward him_ whose lives are a perverse contradiction to his will_ are abomination to the Lord. He that hates nothing that he has made yet abhors those who have thus marred themselves; they are not only abominable in his sight_ but an abomination. The righteous therefore have no reason to envy them_ for they have his secret with them; they are his favourites; he has that communion with them which is a secret to the world and in which they have a joy that a stranger does not intermeddle with; he communicates to them the secret tokens of his love; his covenant is with them; they know his mind_ and the meanings and intentions of his providence_ better than others can. Shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do? 2. Sinners are under the curse of God_ they and their houses; saints are under his blessing_ they and their habitation_ v,20250223
The frowns of all the world cannot trouble those whom God quiets with his smiles. When he gives quietness who then can make trouble? v,20250223
The fruits and exercises of grace are pleasant to the Lord Jesus. ,20250223
The gains of religion are infinitely greater than the losses of it_ and so it will appear when they are balanced. But can a man be thus profitable to God? No_ for such is the perfection of God that he cannot receive any benefit or advantage by men; what can be added to that which is infinite? And such is the weakness and imperfection of man that he cannot offer any benefit or advantage to God. Can the light of a candle be profitable to the sun or the drop of the bucket to the ocean? He that is wise is profitable to himself_ for his own direction and defence_ his own credit and comfort; he can with his wisdom entertain himself and enrich himself; but can he so be profitable to God? No; God needs not us nor our services. We are undone_ for ever undone_ without him; but he is happy_ for ever happy_ without us. Is it any gain to him_ any real addition to his glory or wealth_ if we make our way perfect? Suppose it were absolutely perfect_ yet what is God the better? Much less when it is so far short of being perfect,20250223
The general doctrine of the vanity of the creature laid down (ver. 2) and explained_ ver. 3.,20250223
The general scope and design of the book. What is it that this royal preacher has to say? That which he aims at is_ for the making of us truly religious_ to take down our esteem of and expectation from the things of this world. In order to this_ he shows_,20250223
The getting of this heavenly wisdom is better than the getting of worldly wealth. Many take care and pains to get wealth_ and yet come short of it; but grace was never denied to any that sincerely sought it. There is vanity and vexation of spirit in getting wealth_ but joy and satisfaction of spirit in getting wisdom. Great peace have those that love it.,20250223
The glories of the kingdom of his grace are unsearchable and unparalleled; for who besides has ascended into heaven and descended? Who besides is perfectly acquainted with both worlds_ and has himself a free correspondence with both_ and is therefore fit to settle a correspondence between them_ as Mediator_ as Jacob's ladder? He was in heaven in the Father's bosom (John i. 1_ 18); thence he descended to take our nature upon him; and never was there such condescension. In that nature he again ascended (Eph. iv. to receive the promised glories of his exalted state; and who besides has done this? Rom. x,20250223
The glories of the kingdom of his providence are likewise unsearchable and unparalleled. The same that reconciles heaven and earth was the Creator of both and governs and disposes of all. His government of the three lower elements of air_ water_ and earth_ is here particularized. ,20250223
The glorious inhabitants of the upper world are all perfectly observant of him and entirely acquiesce in his will: He maketh peace in his high places. He enjoys himself in a perfect tranquillity. The holy angels never quarrel with him_ nor with one another_ but entirely acquiesce in his will_ and unanimously execute it without murmuring or disputing. Thus the will of God is done in heaven; and thus we pray that it may be done by us and others on earth. The sun_ moon_ and stars_ keep their courses_ and never clash with one another: nay_ even in this lower region_ which is often disturbed with storms and tempests_ yet when God pleases he commands peace_ by making the storm a calm_ Ps. cvii. 29; lxv,20250223
The glory of God_ as the Creator of the world_ is to be celebrated with joy and triumph by all his reasonable creatures; for they are qualified and appointed to be the collectors of his praises from the inferior creatures_ who can praise him merely as objects that exemplify his workmanship. ,20250223
The good answer which Elihu gives to this (v. 4): __I will undertake to answer thee_ and thy companions with thee___ that is_ __all those that approve thy sayings and are ready to justify thee in them_ and all others that say as thou sayest: __I have that to offer which will silence them all.__ To do this he has recourse to his old maxim (ch. xxxiii. that God is greater than man. This is a truth which_ if duly improved_ will serve many good purposes_ and particularly this to prove that God is debtor to no man. The greatest of men may be a debtor to the meanest; but such is the infinite disproportion between God and man that the great God cannot possibly receive any benefit by man_ and therefore cannot be supposed to lie under any obligation to man; for_ if he be obliged by his purpose and promise_ it is only to himself. That is a challenge which no man can take up (Rom. xi.,20250223
The good character of a wise and virtuous man implied. He is one that has rule over his own spirit; he maintains the government of himself_ and of his own appetites and passions_ and does not suffer them to rebel against reason and conscience. He has the rule of his own thoughts_ his desires_ his inclinations_ his resentments_ and keeps them all in good order,20250223
The good conduct of a wise and good man; he manages himself well. It is not the wisdom of the learned_ which consists only in speculation_ that is here recommended_ but the wisdom of the prudent_ which is practical_ and is of use to direct our counsels and actions. Christian prudence consists in a right understanding of our way; for we are travellers_ whose concern it is_ not to spy wonders_ but to get forward towards their journey's end. It is to understand our own way_ not to be critics and busybodies in other men's matters_ but to look well to ourselves and ponder the path of our feet_ to understand the directions of our way_ that we may observe them_ the dangers of our way_ that we may avoid them_ the difficulties of our way_ that we may break through them_ and the advantages of our way_ that we may improve them—to understand the rules we are to walk by and the ends we are to walk towards_ and walk accordingly,20250223
The good effect which this might probably have; who knows but it may silence and drive away a backbiting tongue? Sin_ if it be countenanced_ becomes daring_ but_ if it receive any check_ it is so conscious of its own shame that it becomes cowardly_ and this sin in particular_ for many abuse those they speak of only in hopes to curry favour with those they speak to.,20250223
The good encouragement which Eliphaz gives Job_ that he shall be very happy_ if he will but take this good counsel. In general_ __Thereby good shall come unto thee (v. 21); the good that has now departed from thee_ all the good thy heart can desire_ temporal_ spiritual_ eternal good_ shall come to thee. God shall come to thee_ into covenant and communion with thee; and he brings all good with him_ all good in him. Thou art now ruined and brought down_ but_ if thou return to God_ thou shalt be built up again_ and thy present ruins shall be repaired. Thy family shall be built up in children_ thy estate in wealth_ and thy soul in holiness and comfort.__ The promises which Eliphaz here encourages Job with are reducible to three heads:—,20250223
The good things themselves that we enjoy are so_ not only the products of his creating power_ but the gifts of his providential bounty to us. And then they are truly pleasant to us when we take them from the hand of God as a Father_ when we eye his wisdom giving us that which is fittest for us_ and acquiesce in it_ and taste his love and goodness_ relish them_ and are thankful for them. ,20250223
The good use which the righteous should make of Job's afflictions from God_ from his enemies_ and from his friends_ v. 8_ 9. Observe here_,20250223
The gospel is compared to a banner or ensign (Isa. and that which is represented in the banner_ written in it in letters of gold_ letters of blood_ is love_ love; and this is the entertainment in the banqueting-house. Christ is the captain of our salvation_ and he enlists all his soldiers under the banner of love; in that they centre; to that they must continually have an eye_ and be animated by it. The love of Christ must constrain them to fight manfully. When a city was taken the conqueror set up his standard in it. __He has conquered me with his love_ overcome me with kindness_ and that is the banner over me.__ This she speaks of as what she had formerly had experience of_ and she remembers it with delight. Eaten bread must not be forgotten_ but remembered with thankfulness to that God who has fed us with manna in this wilderness.,20250223
The grace which God gives us we must diligently improve. When Christ by his Spirit draws us we must with our spirits run after him. As God says_ I will_ and you shall (Ezek. xxxvi. so we must say_ __Thou shalt and we will; thou shalt work in us both to will and to do_ and therefore we will work out our own salvation__ (Phil. ii. 12_ 13); not only we will walk_ but we will run after thee_ which denotes eagerness of desire_ readiness of affection_ vigour of pursuit_ and swiftness of motion. When thou shalt enlarge my heart then I will run the way of thy commandments (Ps. cxix. 32); when thy right hand upholds me then my soul follows hard after thee (Ps. lxiii. 8); when with lovingkindness to us he draws us (Jer. xxxi. 3) we with lovingkindness to him must run after him_ Isa. xl,20250223
The gracious answer which the bridegroom gives to this request_ v,20250223
The gracious call he gives her to come along with him as a faithful bride_ that must forget her own people and her father's house_ and leave all to cleave to him. Ubi tu Caius_ ibi ego Caia—Where thou Caius art_ I Caia will be. Come with me from Lebanon_ v. 8.,20250223
The gracious discoveries of Christ's love to us should engage us greatly to rejoice in the hold he has of us_ his sovereignty over us and property in us_ which is no less a spring of comfort than a bond of duty. Intimacy of communion with Christ should help clear up our interest in him. Glorying in this_ that she is his_ to serve him_ and reckoning that her honour_ she comforts herself with this_ that his desire is towards her_ that is_ he is her husband; it is a periphrasis of the conjugal relation_ Gen. iii,20250223
The gracious invitation she has given_ not to some particular friends_ but to all in general_ to come and take part of these provisions. 1. She employs her servants to carry the invitation round about in the country: She has sent forth her maidens_ v,20250223
The grave is a house_ a narrow_ dark_ cold_ ill-furnished house_ but it will be our residence_ where we shall rest and be safe. It is our long home_ our own home; for it is our mother's lap_ and in it we are gathered to our fathers. It is a house appointed for us by him that has appointed us the bounds of all our habitations. It is appointed for all the living. It is the common receptacle_ where rich and poor meet; it is appointed for the general rendezvous. We must all be brought thither shortly. It is God that brings us to it_ for the keys of death and the grave are in his hand_ and we may all know that_ sooner or later_ he will bring us thither. It would be well for us if we would duly consider it. The living know that they shall die; let us_ each of us_ know it with application.,20250223
The grave is the place we shall all meet in. Whatever differences there may be in men's condition in this world_ they must all die_ are all under the same sentence_ and_ to outward appearance_ their deaths are alike. The grave is to one_ as well as another_ a land of silence_ of darkness_ of separation from the living_ and a sleeping-place. It is the common rendezvous of rich and poor_ honourable and mean_ learned and unlearned; the short-lived and long-lived meet in the grave_ only one rides post thither_ the other goes by a slower conveyance; the dust of both mingles_ and lies undistinguished.,20250223
The grave_ into which multitudes fall_ and yet still more will fall_ and it swallows them all up_ and returns none_ Hell and destruction are never full_ ch. xxvii,20250223
The gravity and majesty of his looks and mien_ and his known strictness in animadverting upon every thing that was evil and indecent_ commanded all about him into due decorum. The young men_ who could not keep their countenances_ or_ it may be_ were conscious to themselves of something amiss_ hid themselves_ and got out of his way; and the aged_ though they kept their ground_ yet would not keep their seats: they arose and stood up to do homage to him; those who expected honour from others gave honour to him. Virtue and piety challenge respect from all_ and usually have it; but those that not only are good_ but do good_ are worthy of double honour. Modesty becomes those that are young and in subjection as much as majesty becomes those that are aged and in power. Honour and fear are due to magistrates_ and must be rendered to them_ Rom. xiii,20250223
The great delight Christ takes in his church and in all believers. He delights in them_,20250223
The great difficulty which Solomon met with in studying the book of providence was the little difference that is made between good men and bad in the distribution of comforts and crosses_ and the disposal of events. This has perplexed the minds of many wise and contemplative men. Solomon discourses of it in these verses_ and_ though he does not undertake to find out this work of God_ yet he says that which may prevent its being a stumbling-block to us.,20250223
The great enquiry which Solomon prosecutes in this book is_ What is that good which the sons of men should do? ch. ii,20250223
The great mischief-maker_ and that is malice. Even where there is no manifest occasion of strife_ yet hatred seeks occasion and so stirs it up and does the devil's work. Those are the most spiteful ill-natured people that can be who take a pleasure in setting their neighbours together by the ears_ by tale-bearing_ evil surmises_ and misrepresentations_ blowing up the sparks of contention_ which had lain buried_ into a flame_ at which_ with an unaccountable pleasure_ they warm their hands,20250223
The great peace-maker_ and that is love_ which covers all sins_ that is_ the offences among relations which occasion discord. Love_ instead of proclaiming and aggravating the offence_ conceals and extenuates it as far as it is capable of being concealed and extenuated. Love will excuse the offence which we give through mistake and unadvisedly; when we are able to say that there was no ill intended_ but it was an oversight_ and we love our friend notwithstanding_ this covers it. It will also overlook the offence that is given us_ and so cover it_ and make the best of it: by this means strife is prevented_ or_ if begun_ peace is recovered and restored quickly. The apostle quotes this_ 1 Pet. iv,20250223
The great thing to be then judged of concerning every work is whether it be good or evil_ conformable to the will of God or a violation of it,20250223
The great truths of divinity are of great use to enforce the precepts of morality_ and none more than this—That the eye of God is always upon the children of men. 1. An eye to discern all_ not only from which nothing can be concealed_ but by which every thing is actually inspected_ and nothing overlooked or looked slightly upon: The eyes of the Lord are in every place; for he not only sees all from on high (Ps. xxxiii. but he is every where present. Angels are full of eyes (Rev. iv. but God is all eye. It denotes not only his omniscience_ that he sees all_ but his universal providence_ that he upholds and governs all. Secret sins_ services_ and sorrows_ are under his eye.,20250223
The great work of man's redemption_ and the riches of the covenant of grace_ are a feast to the Lord Jesus and they ought to be so to us. The invitation is very free_ and hearty_ and loving: Eat_ O friends! If Christ comes to sup with us_ it is we that sup with him_ Rev. iii,20250223
The greatest kindness we can do ourselves is to keep at a distance from this sin_ and to look upon it with the utmost dread and detestation (v. 25): __Lust not after her beauty_ no_ not in thy heart_ for_ if thou dost_ thou hast there already committed adultery with her. Talk not of the charms in her face_ neither be thou smitten with her amorous glances; they are all snares and nets; let her not take thee with her eye-lids. Her looks are arrows and fiery darts; they wound_ they kill_ in another sense than what lovers mean; they call it a pleasing captivity_ but it is a destroying one_ it is worse than Egyptian slavery.__,20250223
The greatness and glory of God: I laid the foundations of the earth. This proves him to be the only living and true God_ and a God of power (Isa. xl. 21_ Jer. x. 11_and encourages us to trust in him at all times_ Isa. li. 13_ 16. ,20250223
The greatness and power of princes are judged of by their armies. God is not only himself almighty_ but he has numberless numbers of armies at his beck and disposal_—standing armies that are never disbanded_—regular troops_ and well disciplined_ that are never to seek_ never at a loss_ that never mutiny_—veteran troops_ that have been long in his service_—victorious troops_ that never failed of success nor were ever foiled. All the creatures are his hosts_ angels especially. He is Lord of all_ Lord of hosts. He has numberless armies_ and yet makes peace. He could make war upon us_ but is willing to be at peace with us; and even the heavenly hosts were sent to proclaim peace on earth and good will towards men_ Luke ii,20250223
The greatness of the affronts that were given him. It cannot be imagined how abusive they were.,20250223
The grievances of the spirit are of all others most heavy_ and hardly to be borne; these make sore the shoulders which should sustain the other infirmities. If the spirit be wounded by the disturbance of the reason_ dejection under the trouble_ whatever it is_ and despair of relief_ if the spirit be wounded by the amazing apprehensions of God's wrath for sin_ and the fearful expectations of judgment and fiery indignation_ who can bear this? Wounded spirits cannot help themselves_ nor do others know how to help them. It is therefore wisdom to keep conscience void of offence.,20250223
The guilt of sin is not removed if the gain of sin be not restored,20250223
The hair of the head is said to be like purple. This denotes the universal amiableness of a believer in the eyes of Christ_ even to the hair_ or (as some understand it) the pins with which the hair is dressed. Some by the head and the hair understand the governors of the church_ who_ if they be careful to do their duty_ add much to her comeliness. The head like crimson (so some read it) and the hair like purple_ the two colours worn by great men.,20250223
The hand of the diligent makes rich_ as a means; but here he ascribes it to the blessing of the Lord; but that blessing is upon the hand of the diligent. It is thus in spiritual riches. Diligence in getting them is our duty_ but God's blessing and grace must have all the glory of that which is acquired_ Deut. viii. 17_ 18.,20250223
The hand of the wicked was upon him (v. every hand of the wicked. His hand was against every one_ and therefore every man's hand will be against him. Yet_ in grappling with these_ he might go near to make his part good; but his heart cannot endure_ nor his hands be strong_ when God shall deal with him (Ezek. xxii. when God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and rain it upon him. Every word here speaks terror. It is not only the justice of God that is engaged against him_ but his wrath_ the deep resentment of provocations given to himself; it is the fury of his wrath_ incensed to the highest degree; it is cast upon him with force and fierceness; it is rained upon him in abundance; it comes on his head like the fire and brimstone upon Sodom_ to which the psalmist also refers_ Ps.,20250223
The happiness and honour of the diligent: Their soul shall be made fat; they shall have abundance_ and shall have the comfortable enjoyment of it_ and the more for its being the fruit of their diligence. This is especially true in spiritual affairs. Those that rest in idle wishes know not what the advantages of religion are; whereas those that take pains in the service of God find both the pleasure and profit of it.,20250223
The happiness of a people under a good government. The care and business of a prince should be to establish the land_ to maintain its fundamental laws_ to settle the minds of his subjects and make them easy_ to secure their liberties and properties from hostilities and for posterity_ and to set in order the things that are wanting; this he must do by judgment_ by wise counsels_ and by the steady administration of justice_ without respect of persons_ which will have these good effects,20250223
The happiness of the other world_ which he hoped for_ he will certainly miss of. He hoped to go to heaven_ but he will be shamefully disappointed; he will plead his external profession_ privileges_ and performances_ but all his pleas will be overruled as frivolous: Depart from me_ I know you not. So that_ upon the whole_ it is certain that a formal hypocrite_ with all his gains and all his hopes_ will be miserable in a dying hour.,20250223
The happiness of the saints will be an eternal satisfaction in their graces_ as tokens of and qualifications for God's peculiar favour: A good man shall be abundantly satisfied from himself_ from what God has wrought in him. He has rejoicing in himself alone_ Gal. vi,20250223
The happiness of the sincere. They shall not only be preserved from the evil way which the wicked would decoy them into_ but they shall have good things_ the best things_ in possession_ the graces and comforts of God's Spirit_ besides what they have in reversion.,20250223
The happiness of this virtuous woman.,20250223
The happiness of those magistrates that do their duty. Their throne of honour_ their tribunal of judgment_ shall be established for ever. This will secure to them the favour of God and strengthen their interest in the affections of their people_ both which will be the establishment of their power_ and help to transmit it to posterity and perpetuate it in the family.,20250223
The happiness of those that embrace it: __If thou be wise_ thou shalt be wise for thyself; thou wilt be the gainer by it_ not Wisdom.__ A man cannot be profitable to God. It is to our own good that we are thus courted. __Thou wilt not leave the gain to others__ (as we do our worldly wealth when we die_ which is therefore called another man's_ Luke xvi.,20250223
The happiness of those that walk circumspectly. Those that make conscience of keeping the commandment in every thing_ that live by rule_ as becomes servants and patients_ keep their own souls; they secure their present peace and future bliss_ and provide every way well for themselves. If we keep God's word_ God's word will keep us from every thing really hurtful,20250223
The happy effect of a good government. The presence of the prince goes far towards the putting of wickedness out of countenance; if he inspect his affairs himself_ those that are employed under him will be kept in awe and restrained from doing wrong. If great men be good men_ and will use their power as they may and ought_ what good may they do and what evil may they prevent!,20250223
The happy effects of fidelity: An ambassador who faithfully discharges his trust_ and serves the interests of those who employ him_ is health; he is health to those by whom and for whom he is employed_ heals differences that are between them_ and preserves a good understanding; he is health to himself_ for he secures his own interest. This is applicable to ministers_ Christ's messengers and ambassadors; those that are wicked and false to Christ and the souls of men do mischief and fall into mischief_ but those that are faithful will find sound words to be healing words to others and themselves.,20250223
The harms that surprise us_ unthought of_ giving us no time to arm ourselves by consideration_ are most likely to put us into confusion. But let not the wise and good man forget himself_ and then he will not give way to any fear that has torment_ be the alarm ever so sudden. Let him not fear the desolation of the wicked_ when it comes_ that is_ ,20250223
The head must be filled with the knowledge of the things of God. The knowledge of holy things (the word is plural) is understanding_ the things pertaining to the service of God (those are called holy things)_ that pertain to our own sanctification; reproof is called that which is holy_ Matt. vii,20250223
The head of a believer is lifted up above his enemies (Ps. xxvii. above the storms of the lower region_ as the top of Carmel was_ pointing heaven-ward. The more we get above this world_ and the nearer to heaven_ and the more secure and serene we become by that means_ the more amiable we are in the eyes of the Lord Jesus,20250223
The head of the just crowned with blessings_ with the blessings both of God and man. Variety of blessings_ abundance of blessings_ shall descend from above_ and visibly abide on the head of good men_ real blessings; they shall not only be spoken well of_ but done well to. Blessings shall be on their head as a coronet to adorn and dignify them and as a helmet to protect and secure them,20250223
The heart must be principled with the fear of God; that is the beginning of wisdom. A reverence of God's majesty_ and a dread of his wrath_ are that fear of him which is the beginning_ the first step towards true religion_ whence all other instances of it take rise. This fear may_ at first_ have torment_ but love will_ by degrees_ cast out the torment of it. ,20250223
The hearts of the children of men are subject_ not only to God's view_ but to his judgment: As the fining-pot is for silver_ both to prove it and to improve it so the Lord tries the hearts; he searches whether they are standard or no_ and those that are he refines and makes purer_ Jer. xvii,20250223
The heat of his spirit_ as_ on the one hand_ it made his complaints the more bitter_ so_ on the other hand_ it made his prayers the more lively and importunate; as here: __Why dost thou not pardon my transgression? Art thou not a God of infinite mercy_ that art ready to forgive? Hast not thou wrought repentance in me? Why then dost thou not give me the pardon of my sin_ and make me to hear the voice of that joy and gladness?__ Surely he means more than barely the removing of his outward trouble_ and is herein earnest for the return of God's favour_ which he complained of the want of_ ch. vi,20250223
The heavens will not her the earth unless God hear them_ Hos. ii,20250223
The high encomiums which the bridegroom gives of his spouse. To be given in marriage_ in the Hebrew dialect_ is to be praised (Ps. lxxviii. 63_ margin)_ so this spouse is here; her husband praises this virtuous woman (Prov. xxxi. 28); he praises her_ as is usual in poems_ by similitudes.,20250223
The high opinion which the sluggard has of himself_ notwithstanding the gross absurdity and folly of his slothfulness: He thinks himself wiser than seven men_ than seven wise men_ for they are such as can render a reason. It is the wisdom of a man to be able to render a reason_ of a good man to be able to give a reason of the hope that is in him_ 1 Pet. iii,20250223
The higher bad men sit above the resentments of the earth the nearer they ought to think themselves to the vengeance of Heaven. ,20250223
The hills skipped_ Ps. cxiv,20250223
The history of Job begins here with an account_,20250223
The history of Job's sufferings_ and his patience under them (ch. i._ ii._ not without a mixture of human frailty_ ch. iii. ,20250223
The honour and happiness of the obedient. They will receive commandments; they will take it as a privilege_ and really an ease to them_ to be under government_ which saves them the labour of deliberating and choosing for themselves; and they will take it as a favour to be told their duty and admonished concerning it. And this is their wisdom; those are wise in heart who are tractable_ and those who thus bend_ thus stoop_ shall stand and be established_ shall prosper_ being well advised,20250223
The honour of doing good is what we may laudably be ambitious of. It cannot but be the desire of man_ if he have any spark of virtue in him_ to be kind; one would not covet an estate for any thing so much as thereby to be put into a capacity of relieving the poor and obliging our friends,20250223
The honour of it. He that gets and keeps the mastery of his passions is better than the mighty_ better than he that by a long siege takes a city or by a long war subdues a country. Behold_ a greater than Alexander or Cæsar is here. The conquest of ourselves_ and our own unruly passions_ requires more true wisdom_ and a more steady_ constant_ and regular management_ than the obtaining of a victory over the forces of an enemy. A rational conquest is more honourable to a rational creature than a brutal one. It is a victory that does nobody any harm; no lives or treasures are sacrificed to it_ but only some base lusts. It is harder_ and therefore more glorious_ to quash an insurrection at home than to resist an invasion from a broad; nay_ such are the gains of meekness that by it we are more than conquerors.,20250223
The honours of the honest and diligent. The righteous and industrious have their desires satisfied_ and enjoy not only that satisfaction_ but the further satisfaction of doing good to others. The slothful are always craving and gaping to receive_ but the righteous are always full and contriving to give; and it is more blessed to give than to receive. They give and spare not_ give liberally and upbraid not; they give a portion to seven and also to eight_ and do not spare for fear of wanting.,20250223
The hope of hypocrites is a great cheat upon themselves_ and_ though it may flourish for a while_ it will certainly perish at last_ and they with it.,20250223
The hungry_ who know how to value God's blessings_ are filled with good things_ but the rich_ who despise them_ are justly sent empty away.,20250223
The hypocrite deceived. He has gained_ and he has hope; this is his bright side. It is allowed that he has gained by his hypocrisy_ has gained the praise and applause of men and the wealth of this world. Jehu gained a kingdom by his hypocrisy and the Pharisees many a widow's house. Upon this gain he builds his hope_ such as it is. He hopes he is in good circumstances for another world_ because he finds he is so for this_ and he blesses himself in his own way. ,20250223
The hypocrite undeceived. He will at last see himself wretchedly cheated; for_ ,20250223
The ice and the frost_ by which the waters are congealed and the earth incrustrated_ are produced by his providence_ v. 29_ 30. These are very common things_ which lessens the strangeness of them. But_ considering what a vast change is made by them in a very little time_ how the waters are hid as with a stone_ as with a grave-stone_ laid upon them (so thick_ so strong_ is the ice that covers them)_ and the face even of the deep is sometimes frozen_ we may well ask_ __Out of whose womb came the ice? What created power could produce such a wonderful work?__ No power but that of the Creator himself. Frost and snow come from him_ and therefore should lead our thoughts and meditations to him who does such great things_ past finding out. And we shall the more easily bear the inconveniences of winter-weather if we learn to make this good use of it.,20250223
The idea they have of worldly wealth. They call it precious substance; whereas it is neither substance nor precious; it is a shadow; it is vanity_ especially that which is got by robbery_ Ps. lxii,20250223
The ill consequences of betraying a trust. A wicked messenger_ who_ being sent to negotiate any business_ is false to him that employed him_ divulges his counsels_ and so defeats his designs_ cannot expect to prosper_ but will certainly fall into some mischief or other_ will be discovered and punished_ since nothing is more hateful to God and man than the treachery of those that have a confidence reposed in them,20250223
The ill consequences of it (v. 5): Lest they drink away their understandings and memories_ drink and forget the law by which they are to govern; and so_ instead of doing good with their power_ do hurt with it_ and pervert or alter the judgment of all the sons of affliction_ and_ when they should right them_ wrong them_ and add to their affliction. It is a sad complaint which is made of the priests and prophets (Isa. xxviii. that they have erred through wine_ and through strong drink they are out of the way; and the effect is as bad in kings_ who when they are drunk_ or intoxicated with the love of wine_ cannot but stumble in judgment. Judges must have clear heads_ which those cannot have who so often make themselves giddy_ and incapacitate themselves to judge of the most common things.,20250223
The ill use which his friends made of his miseries. They trampled upon him_ and insulted over him_ and condemned him as a hypocrite_ because he was thus grievously afflicted. Hard usage! Now observe_,20250223
The immediate answer that was given to this prayer: The King has drawn me_ has brought me into his chambers. It is not so much an answer fetched by faith from the world of Christ's grace as an answer fetched by experience from the workings of his grace. If we observe_ as we ought_ the returns of prayer_ we may find that sometimes_ while we are yet speaking_ Christ hears_ Isa. lxv.,20250223
The immutability of the divine counsels concerning them and the unsearchableness of those counsels_ ver. 11-15.,20250223
The imprecation with which he confirms this protestation (v. 22): __If I have been oppressive to the poor_ let my arm fall from my shoulder-blade and my arm be broken from the bone___ that is_ __let the flesh rot off from the bone and one bone be disjointed and broken off from another.__ Had he not been perfectly clear in this matter_ he durst not thus have challenged the divine vengeance. And he intimates that it is a righteous thing with God to break the arm that is lifted up against the fatherless_ as he withered Jeroboam's arm that was stretched out against a prophet.,20250223
The indecency of drunkenness in a king. However some may call it a fashionable accomplishment and entertainment_ it is not for kings_ O Lemuel! it is not for kings_ to allow themselves that liberty; it is a disparagement to their dignity_ and profanes their crown_ by confusing the head that wears it; that which for the time unmans them does for the time unking them. Shall we say_ They are gods? No_ they are worse than the beasts that perish. All Christians are made to our God kings and priests_ and must apply this to themselves. It is not for Christians_ it is not for Christians_ to drink to excess; they debase themselves if they do; it ill becomes the heirs of the kingdom and the spiritual priests_ Lev. x. 9.,20250223
The inference he draws from all this_ v,20250223
The inferences drawn from this observation. If our present state be subject to such vicissitude,20250223
The inferior creatures_ being incapable of doing moral actions_ are incapable of receiving rewards and punishments: but_ among the children of men_ God causes the rain to come_ either for the correction of his land or for a mercy to it_ v,20250223
The iniquity of a bad man will itself be his ruin. As the plainness of a good man will be his protection_ though he is ever so much exposed_ so the perverseness of sinners will be their destruction_ though they think themselves eve so well fortified. They shall fall into pits of their own digging_ ch. v. 22.,20250223
The instances here given of the miserable condition of the wicked man in this world are expressed with great fulness and fluency of language_ and the same thing returned to again and repeated in other words. Let us therefore reduce the particulars to their proper heads_ and observe_,20250223
The instructions he gives them. Observe,20250223
The instructions which Wisdom gives to the maidens she sends to invite_ to the ministers and others_ who in their places are endeavouring tot serve her interests and designs. She tells them_,20250223
The interposing firmament is to him as transparent crystal_ Ezek. i,20250223
The issue and consequence of it would be very good_ v,20250223
The issue of all in Job's honour and prosperity_ ch. xlii. Upon the whole_ we learn that many are the afflictions of the righteous_ but that when the Lord delivers them out of them all the trial of their faith will be found to praise_ and honour_ and glory.,20250223
The issue of it will certainly be the ruin of the soul and all its welfare. It is everlasting want that thus comes upon it as an armed man. We know the place assigned to the wicked and slothful servant.,20250223
The issue of this obstinacy is to be greatly dreaded: Those that go on in sin_ in spite of admonition_ shall be destroyed; those that will not be reformed must expect to be ruined; if the rods answer not the end_ expect the axes. They shall be suddenly destroyed_ in the midst of their security_ and without remedy; they have sinned against the preventing remedy_ and therefore let them not expect any recovering remedy. Hell is remediless destruction. They shall be destroyed_ and no healing_ so the word is. If God wounds_ who can heal?,20250223
The joint of the thighs are here said to be like jewels_ and those curiously wrought by a cunning workman. This is explained by Eph. iv. 16 and Col. ii. 19_ where the mystical body of Christ is said to be held together by joints and bands_ as the hips and knees (both which are the joints of the thighs) serve the natural body in its strength and motion. The church is then comely in Christ's eyes when those joints are kept firm by holy love and unity_ and the communion of saints. When believers act in religion from good principles_ and are steady and regular in their whole conversation_ and turn themselves easily to every duty in its time and place_ then the joints are like jewels,20250223
The judge himself of counsel for the accused_ and pleading for him (v. 3): __Hast thou considered my servant Job better than thou didst_ and art thou now at length convinced that he is a faithful servant of mine_ a perfect and an upright man; for thou seest he still holds fast his integrity?__ This is now added to his character_ as a further achievement; instead of letting go his religion_ and cursing God_ he holds it faster than ever_ as that which he has now more than ordinary occasion for. He is the same in adversity that he was in prosperity_ and rather better_ and more hearty and lively in blessing God than ever he was_ and takes root the faster for being thus shaken. See,20250223
The judgment of God concerning us_ we are sure_ is according to truth: He weighs the spirits in a just and unerring balance_ knows what is in us_ and passes a judgment upon us accordingly_ writing Tekel upon that which passed our scale with approbation—weighed in the balance and found wanting; and by his judgment we must stand or fall. He not only sees men's ways but tries their spirits_ and we are as our spirits are.,20250223
The just have a habitation_ a poor cottage (the word is used for sheep-cotes)_ a very mean dwelling; but God blesses it; he is continually blessing it_ from the beginning of the year to the end of it. The curse or blessing of God is upon the house according as the inhabitants are wicked or godly; and it is certain that a blessed family_ though poor_ has no reason to envy a cursed family_ though rich,20250223
The just praise of those who improve their opportunities_ who take pains to gather and increase what they have_ both for soul and body_ who provide for hereafter while provision is to be made_ who gather in summer_ which is gathering time. He who does so is a wise son_ and it is his honour; he acts wisely for his parents_ whom_ if there be occasion_ he ought to maintain_ and he gives reputation to himself_ his family_ and his education,20250223
The just reproach and blame of those who trifle away these opportunities: He who sleeps_ loves his ease_ idles away his time_ and neglects his work_ especially who sleeps in harvest_ when he should be laying in for winter_ who lets slip the season of furnishing himself with that which he will have occasion for_ is a son that causes shame; for he is a foolish son; he prepares shame for himself when winter comes_ and reflects shame upon all his friends. He who gets knowledge and wisdom in the days of his youth gathers in summer_ and he will have the comfort and credit of his industry; but he who idles away the days of his youth will bear the shame of his indolence when he is old.,20250223
The just vengeance God takes on those that speak and act against knowledge and against the interests of knowledge and religion in the world: He overthrows the words of the transgressor_ and preserves knowledge in spite of him. He defeats all the counsels and designs of false and treacherous men_ and turns them to their own confusion.,20250223
The knowledge of God's revealed will_ the will of his precept_ and this is within our reach; it is level to our capacity_ and will do us good (v. 28): Unto man he said_ Behold_ the fear of the Lord that is wisdom. Let it not be said that when God concealed his counsels from man_ and forbade him that tree of knowledge_ it was because he grudged him any thing that would contribute to his real bliss and satisfaction; no_ he let him know as much as he was concerned to know in order to his duty and happiness; he shall be entrusted with as much of his sovereign mind as is needful and fit for a subject_ but he must not think himself fit to be a privy-counsellor. He said to Adam (so some)_ to the first man_ in the day in which he was created; he told him plainly it was not for him to amuse himself with over-curious searches into the mysteries of creation_ nor to pretend to solve all the phenomena of nature; he would find it neither possible nor profitable to do so. No less wisdom (says archbishop Tillotson) than that which made the world can thoroughly understand the philosophy of it. But let him look upon this as his wisdom_ to fear the Lord and to depart from evil; let him learn that_ and he is learned enough; let this knowledge serve his turn. When God forbade man the tree of knowledge he allowed him the tree of life_ and this is that tree_ Prov. iii,20250223
The knowledge of sin is a difficult knowledge_ and hard to be attained; Solomon took pains for it. Sin has many disguises with which it palliates itself_ as being loth to appear sin_ and it is very hard to strip it of these and to see it in its true nature and colours. ,20250223
The labourers that he employed had their wages duly paid them_ and_ if he made use of the fruits of those lands that he let out_ he paid his tenants for them_ or allowed it in their rent. ,20250223
The land is then blessed_ ,20250223
The last days of a good man sometimes prove his best days_ his last works his best works_ his last comforts his best comforts; for his path_ like that of the morning-light_ shines more and more to the perfect day. Of a wicked man it is said_ His last state is worse than his first (Luke xi. but of the upright man_ His end is peace; and sometimes the nearer it is the clearer are the views of it. In respect of outward prosperity God is pleased sometimes to make the latter end of a good man's life more comfortable than the former part of it has been_ and strangely to outdo the expectations of his afflicted people_ who thought they should never live to see better days_ that we may not despair even in the depths of adversity. We know not what good times we may yet be reserved for in our latter end. Non_ si male nunc_ et olim sic erit—It may yet be well with us_ though now it is otherwise. Job_ in his affliction_ had wished to be as in months past_ as rich as he had been before_ and quite despaired of that; but God is often better to us than our own fears_ nay_ than our own wishes_ for Job's possessions were doubled to him; the number of his cattle_ his sheep and camels_ his oxen and she-asses_ is just double here to what it was_ ch. i,20250223
The least that can be expected from her neighbours is that they should let her own works praise her_ and do nothing to hinder them. Those that do that which is good_ let them have praise of the same ( Rom. xiii. 3) and let us not enviously say_ or do_ any thing to the diminishing of it_ but be provoked by it to a holy emulation. Let none have an ill report from us_ that have a good report even of the truth itself. Thus is shut up this looking-glass for ladies_ which they are desired to open and dress themselves by; and_ if they do so_ their adorning will be found to praise_ and honour_ and glory_ at the appearing of Jesus Christ.,20250223
The leviathan_ even prima facie—at first sight_ appears formidable and inaccessible_ v. 13_ 14. Who dares come so near him while he is alive as to discover or take a distinct view of the face of the garment_ the skin with which he is clothed as with a garment_ so near him as to bridle him like a horse and so lead him away_ so near him as to be within reach of his jaws_ which are like a double bridle? Who will venture to look into his mouth_ as we do into a horse's mouth? He that opens the doors of his face will see his teeth terrible round about_ strong and sharp_ and fitted to devour; it would make a man tremble to think of having a leg or an arm between them. ,20250223
The life_ the living soul that God has given us_ is more than meat; the body_ that God has made us_ is more than raiment; let him therefore that has done the greater for us be cheerfully depended upon to do the less.,20250223
The light of the righteous is as that of the sun_ which may be eclipsed and clouded_ but will continue; that of the wicked is as a lamp of their own kindling_ which will presently go out and is easily put out.,20250223
The lion did tear in pieces for his whelps_ but now they must shift for themselves. Perhaps Eliphaz intended_ in this_ to reflect upon Job_ as if he_ being the greatest of all the men of the east_ had got his estate by spoil and used his power in oppressing his neighbours_ but now his power and estate were gone_ and his family was scattered: if so_ it was a pity that a man whom God praised should be thus abused.,20250223
The lips of knowledge (a good understanding to guide the lips and a good elocution to diffuse the knowledge) are to be preferred far before gold_ and pearl_ and rubies; for,20250223
The little heart he has to use this which God gives him_ for the ends and purposes for which it was given him. This is his fault and folly that he renders not again according to the benefit done unto him_ and serves not the Lord God his benefactor_ with joyfulness and gladness of heart_ in the abundance of all things. In the day of prosperity he is not joyful. Tristis es_ et felix?—Art thou happy_ yet sad? See his folly: 1. He cannot find in his heart to take the comfort of what he has himself. He has meat before him; he has wherewith to maintain himself and his family comfortably_ but he has not power to eat thereof. His sordid niggardly temper will not suffer him to lay it out_ no_ not upon himself_ no_ not upon that which is most necessary for himself. He has not power to reason himself out of this absurdity_ to conquer his covetous humour. He is weak indeed_ who has not power to use what God gives him_ for God gives him not that power_ but withholds it from him_ to punish him for his other abuses of his wealth. Because he has not the will to serve God with it_ God denies him the power to serve himself with it,20250223
The locusts; they are little also_ and have no king_ as the bees have_ but they go forth all of them by bands_ like an army in battle-array; and_ observing such good order among themselves_ it is not any inconvenience to them that they have no king. They are called God's great army (Joel ii. 25); for_ when he pleases_ he musters_ he marshals them_ and wages war by them_ as he did upon Egypt. They go forth all of them gathered together (so the margin); sense of weakness should engage us to keep together_ that we may strengthen the hands of one another,20250223
The lofty looks of man shall be humbled_ and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down_ and thus the Lord alone shall be exalted.,20250223
The lover languishes_ but not his love.,20250223
The lowly in heart_ and those that mourn_ he advances_ comforts_ and makes to dwell on high_ in the munitions of rocks_ Isa. xxxiii,20250223
The lustre of his royal person_ when he appears in his greatest pomp_ v,20250223
The lusts of the flesh_ and the love of the world_ are the two fatal rocks on which multitudes split; against these Job protests he was always careful to stand upon his guard.,20250223
The lusts of uncleanness not only war against the soul_ which the sinner neglects and is in no care about_ but they war against the body too_ which he is so indulgent of and is in such care to please and pamper_ such deceitful_ such foolish_ such hurtful lusts are they. Those that give themselves to work uncleanness with greediness waste their strength_ throw themselves into weakness_ and often have their bodies filled with loathsome distempers_ by which the number of their months is cut off in the midst and they fall unpitied sacrifices to a cruel lust. ,20250223
The many honours put upon him_ and the power and dominion he is entrusted with: Go forth_ and see king Jesus_ with the crown wherewith his Father crowned him_ when he declared him his beloved Son_ in whom he was well-pleased_ when he set him as King upon his holy hill of Zion_ when he advanced him to his own right hand_ and invested him with a sovereign authority_ both in heaven and in earth_ and put all things under his feet. ,20250223
The marks of a wicked man. He that has a high look and a proud heart_ that carries himself insolently and scornfully towards both God and man_ and that is always ploughing and plotting_ designing and devising some mischief or other_ is indeed a wicked man. The light of the wicked is sin. Sin is the pride_ the ambition_ the glory and joy_ and the business of wicked men,20250223
The matter of his oath_ v. 3_ 4. 1. That he would not speak wickedness_ nor utter deceit—that_ in general_ he would never allow himself in the way of lying_ that_ as in this debate he had all along spoken as he thought_ so he would never wrong his conscience by speaking otherwise; he would never maintain any doctrine_ nor assert any matter of fact_ but what he believed to be true; nor would he deny the truth_ how much soever it might make against him: and_ whereas his friends charged him with being a hypocrite_ he was ready to answer_ upon oath_ to all their interrogatories_ if called to do so. On the one hand he would not_ for all the world_ deny the charge if he knew himself guilty_ but would declare the truth_ the whole truth_ and nothing but the truth_ and take to himself the shame of his hypocrisy. On the other hand_ since he was conscious to himself of his integrity_ and that he was not such a man as his friends represented him_ he would never betray his integrity_ nor charge himself with that which he was innocent of. He would not be brought_ no_ not by the rack of their unjust censures_ falsely to accuse himself. If we must not bear false witness against our neighbour_ then not against ourselves,20250223
The meanness and contemptibleness of man: __Where wast thou then? Thou that hast made such a figure among the children of the east_ and settest up for an oracle_ and a judge of the divine counsels_ where was thou when the foundations of the earth were laid?__ So far were we from having any hand in the creation of the world_ which might entitle us to a dominion in it_ or so much as being witnesses of it_ by which we might have gained an insight into it_ that we were not then in being. The first man was not_ much less were we. It is the honour of Christ that he was present when this was done (Prov. viii. 22_ &c._ John i. 1_ 2); but we are of yesterday and know nothing. Let us not therefore find fault with the works of God_ nor prescribe to him. He did not consult us in making the world_ and yet it is well made; why should we expect then that he should take his measures from us in governing it?,20250223
The means of this grace is the word_ which_ if we take it aright_ will turn us; it is therefore promised_ __I will make known my words unto you_ not only speak them to you_ but make them known_ give you to understand them.__ Note_ Special grace is necessary to a sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any that honestly seek it and submit to it.,20250223
The message itself. Before it was delivered there was silence_ profound silence_ v,20250223
The messenger by whom it was sent—a spirit_ one of the good angels_ who are employed not only as the ministers of God's providence_ but sometimes as the ministers of his word. Concerning this apparition which Eliphaz saw we are here told (v. 15_ 16),20250223
The messenger called the lightning the fire of God (and innocently enough)_ but perhaps Satan thereby designed to strike into his mind this thought_ that God had turned to be his enemy and fought against him_ which was much more grievous to him than all the insults of the Sabeans. He owned (ch. xxxi. 23) that destruction from God was a terror to him. How terrible then were the tidings of this destruction_ which came immediately from the hand of God! Had the fire from heaven consumed the sheep upon the altar_ he might have construed it into a token of God's favour; but_ the fire consuming them in the pasture_ he could not but look upon it as a token of God's displeasure. There have not been the like since Sodom was burned.,20250223
The ministers of the gospel are commissioned and commanded to give notice of the preparations which God has made_ in the everlasting covenant_ for all those that are willing to come up to the terms of it; and they_ with maiden purity_ not corrupting themselves or the word of God_ and with an exact observance of their orders_ are to call upon all they meet with_ even in the highways and hedges_ to come and feast with Wisdom_ for all things are now ready_ Luke xiv. 23,20250223
The mischief of drunkenness: Wine is a mocker; strong drink is raging. It is so to the sinner himself; it mocks him_ makes a fool of him_ promises him that satisfaction which it can never give him. It smiles upon him at first_ but at the last it bites. In reflection upon it_ it rages in his conscience. It is raging in the body_ puts the humours into a ferment. When the wine is in the wit is out_ and then the man_ according as his natural temper is_ either mocks like a fool or rages like a madman. Drunkenness_ which pretends to be a sociable thing_ renders men unfit for society_ for it makes them abusive with their tongues and outrageous in their passions_ ch. xxiii. 29,20250223
The mischief of rashness and inconsideration. The simple_ who believe every word that flatters them_ will believe none that warns them_ and so they pass on and are punished. They venture upon sin_ though they are told what will be in the end thereof; they throw themselves into trouble_ notwithstanding the fair warning given them_ and they repent their presumption when it is too late. See an instance of both these_ Exod. ix. 20_ 21. Nothing is so fatal to precious souls as this_ they will not take warning.,20250223
The mischief of undue indulgence: A child that is not restrained or reproved_ but is left to himself_ as Adonijah was_ to follow his own inclinations_ may do well if he will_ but_ if he take to ill courses_ nobody will hinder him; it is a thousand to one but he proves a disgrace to his family_ and brings his mother_ who fondled him and humoured him in his licentiousness_ to shame_ to poverty_ to reproach_ and perhaps will himself be abusive to her and give her ill language.,20250223
The miseries of the slothful_ whose hands refuse to labour in an honest calling_ by which they might get an honest livelihood. They are as fit for labour as other men_ and business offers itself_ to which they might lay their hands and apply their minds_ but they will not; herein they fondly think they do well for themselves_ see ch. xxvi,20250223
The miseries of wicked man. His raised expectations_ his high designs_ and most elaborate contrivances and projects_ are sin to him; he contracts guilt in them and so prepares trouble for himself. The very business of all wicked men_ as well as their pleasure_ is nothing but sin; so Bishop Patrick. They do all to serve their lusts_ and have no regard to the glory of God in it_ and therefore their ploughing is sin_ and no marvel when their sacrificing is so_ ch. xv. 8.,20250223
The misery and shame of the slothful. See how foolish and absurd they are; they desire the gains which the diligent get_ but they hate the pains which the diligent take; they covet every thing that is to be coveted_ but will do nothing that is to be done; and therefore it follows_ They have nothing; for he that will not labour let him hunger_ and let him not eat_ 2 Thess. iii,20250223
The misery of a people under a bad government: A man of oblations (so it is in the margin) overthrows the land; a man that is either sacrilegious or superstitious_ or that invades the priest's office_ as Saul and Uzziah—or a man that aims at nothing but getting money_ and will_ for a good bribe_ connive at the most guilty_ and_ in hope of one_ persecute the innocent—such governors as these will ruin a country.,20250223
The misery of damned sinners is here set forth in a few words_ but very terrible ones. They lie under the wrath of an Almighty God_ who_ in their destruction_ both shows his wrath and makes known his power; and_ if this will be his condition in the other world_ what good will his prosperity in this world do him? What pleasure has he in his house after him? v,20250223
The misery of sinners will be an eternal surfeit upon their sins: The backslider in heart_ who for fear of suffering_ or in hope of profit or pleasure_ forsakes God and his duty_ shall be filled with his own ways; God will give him enough of them. They would not leave their brutish lusts and passions_ and therefore they shall stick by them_ to their everlasting terror and torment. He that is filthy shall be filthy still. __Son_ remember___ shall fill them with their own ways_ and set their sins in order before them. Backsliding begins in the heart; it is the evil heart of unbelief that departs from God; and of all sinners backsliders will have most terror when they reflect on their own ways_ Luke xi. 26,20250223
The misery of the people that want a settled ministry: Where there is no vision_ no prophet to expound the law_ no priest or Levite to teach the good knowledge of the Lord_ no means of grace_ the word of the Lord is scarce_ there is no open vision (1 Sam. iii. 1)_ where it is so the people perish; the word has many significations_ any of which will apply here. 1. The people are made naked_ stripped of their ornaments and so exposed to shame_ stripped of their armour and so exposed to danger. How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers_ and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls! 2. The people rebel_ not only against God_ but against their prince; good preaching would make people good subjects_ but_ for want of it_ they are turbulent and factious_ and despise dominions_ because they know no better,20250223
The misery of those that fall into their hands (v. 7_ 8): They cause the naked_ whom they have stripped_ not leaving them the clothes to their backs_ to lodge_ in the cold nights_ without clothing_ so that they are wet with the showers of the mountains_ and_ for want of a better shelter_ embrace the rock_ and are glad of a cave or den in it to preserve them from the injuries of the weather. Eliphaz had charged Job with such inhumanity as this_ concluding that Providence would not thus have stripped him if he had not first stripped the naked of their clothing_ ch. xxii,20250223
The misery of those that live at large and never mind what they do: Those that despair their ways shall die_ shall perish eternally; they are in the high road to ruin. With respect to those that are careless about the end of their ways_ and never consider whither they are going_ and about the rule of their ways_ that will walk in the way of their hearts and after the course of the world (Eccl. xi. that never consider what they have done nor what they are concerned to do_ but walk at all adventures (Lev. xxvi. right or wrong_ it is all one to them—what can come of this but the greatest mischief?,20250223
The moderators were_ First_ Elihu_ ch. xxxii.-xxxvii. Secondly_ God himself_ ch.,20250223
The moon shall be confounded_ and the sun ashamed_ when the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Sion. The heavenly bodies are often clouded; we plainly see spots in the moon_ and_ with the help of glasses_ may sometimes discern spots upon the sun too: but God sees spots in them that we do not see. How durst Job then so confidently appeal to God_ who would discover that amiss in him which he was not aware of in himself? 2. The children of men_ though noble creatures_ are before God but as worms of the earth (v. 6): How much less does man shine in honour_ how much less is he pure in righteousness that is a worm_ and the son of man_ whoever he be_ that is a worm!—a vermin (so some)_ not only mean and despicable_ but noxious and detestable; a mite (so others)_ the smallest animal_ which cannot be discerned with the naked eye_ but through a magnifying glass. Such a thing is man. ,20250223
The more closely we eye the majesty of God as our Maker_ and the more we dread his wrath and justice_ the less danger shall we be in of a sinful fearing or flattering of men.,20250223
The more meat the more mouths. Does the estate thrive? And does not the family at the same time grow more numerous and the children grow up to need more? The more men have the better house they must keep_ the more servants they must employ_ the more guests they must entertain_ the more they must give to the poor_ and the more they will have hanging on them_ for where the carcase is the eagles will be. What we have more than food and raiment we have for others; and then what good is there to the owners themselves_ but the pleasure of beholding it with their eyes? And a poor pleasure it is. An empty speculation is all the difference between the owners and the sharers; the owner sees that as his own which those about him enjoy as much of the real benefit of as he; only he has the satisfaction of doing good to others_ which indeed is a satisfaction to one who believes what Christ said_ that it is more blessed to give than to receive; but to a covetous man_ who thinks all lost that goes beside himself_ it is a constant vexation to see others eat of his increase.,20250223
The more sin there is the nearer is the ruin threatened. Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners. Let them not say that they have cleansed their hands in vain_ or that God has forsaken the earth_ but wait with patience; the transgressors shall fall_ the measure of their iniquity will be full_ and then they shall fall from their dignity and power_ and fall into disgrace and destruction_ and the righteous shall have the satisfaction of seeing their fall (Ps. xxxvii. perhaps in this world_ certainly in the judgment of the great day_ when the fall of God's implacable enemies will be the joy and triumph of glorified saints. See Isa. lxvi. 24; Gen. xix. 28.,20250223
The more sinners there are the more sin there is: When the wicked_ being countenanced by authority_ grow numerous_ and walk on every side_ no marvel if transgression increases_ as a plague in the country is said to increase when still more and more are infected with it. Transgression grows more impudent and bold_ more imperious and threatening_ when there are many to keep it in countenance. In the old world_ when men began to multiply_ they began to degenerate and corrupt themselves and one another,20250223
The more we see of the glory and majesty of God_ and the more we see of the vileness and odiousness of sin and of ourselves because of sin_ the more we shall abase and abhor ourselves for it. __Now my eye sees what a God he is whom I have offended_ the brightness of that majesty which by wilful sin I have spit in the face of_ the tenderness of that mercy which I have spurned at the bowels of; now I see what a just and holy God he is whose wrath I have incurred; wherefore I abhor myself. Woe is me_ for I am undone___ Isa. vi,20250223
The most pleasant delightful fields_ even in the spring-time_ when the country is most pleasant_ will not satisfy her_ unless she have her beloved with her. No delights on earth can make a believer easy_ unless he enjoy God in all.,20250223
The most sumptuous entertainment_ presented with a sullen brow_ would offend me; while the plainest repast_ presented kindly_ would delight me.,20250223
The motions of the air are of his directing. Satan pretends to be the prince of the power of the air_ but even there Christ has all power; he rebuked the winds and they obeyed him. ,20250223
The mouth of the wicked covered with violence. Their mouths shall be stopped with shame for the violence which they have done; they shall not have a word to say in excuse for themselves (Job v. 16); their breath shall be stopped with the violence that shall be done to them_ when their violent dealings shall return on their heads_ shall be returned to their teeth.,20250223
The mutability even of royal dignity_ not only through the folly of the prince himself (ver. 13_ but through the fickleness of the people_ let the prince be ever so discreet_ ver. 15_ 16. It is not the prerogative even of kings themselves to be exempted from the vanity and vexation that attend these things; let none else then expect it.,20250223
The mutability of all human affairs_ ver. 1-10.,20250223
The names of his daughters are here registered (v. because_ in the significations of them_ they seemed designed to perpetuate the remembrance of God's great goodness to him in the surprising change of his condition. He called the first Jemima—The day (whence perhaps Diana had her name)_ because of the shining forth of his prosperity after a dark night of affliction. The next Kezia_ a spice of a very fragrant smell_ because (says bishop Patrick) God had healed his ulcers_ the smell of which was offensive. The third Keren-happuch (that is Plenty restored_ or A horn of paint)_ because (says he) God had wiped away the tears which fouled his face_ ch. xvi,20250223
The narrative we have here of his prosperity and piety_ his strange afflictions and exemplary patience_ the substance of his conferences with his friends_ and God's discourse with him out of the whirlwind_ with his return at length to a very prosperous condition_ no doubt is exactly true_ though the inspired penman is allowed the usual liberty of putting the matter of which Job and his friends discoursed into his own words.,20250223
The nature and property of it would be altered. Though it looked like a man's misery_ it would really be his bliss: Happy is the man whom God correcteth if he make but a due improvement of the correction. A good man is happy though he be afflicted_ for_ whatever he has lost_ he has not lost his enjoyment of God nor his title to heaven. Nay_ he is happy because he is afflicted; correction is an evidence of his sonship and a means of his sanctification; it mortifies his corruptions_ weans his heart from the world_ draws him nearer to God_ brings him to his Bible_ brings him to his knees_ works him for_ and so is working for him_ a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Happy therefore is the man whom God correcteth_ Jam. i,20250223
The nature of injustice. Getting money by lying (v. 6) is no better than downright robbery. Cheating is stealing; you might as well pick a man's pocket as impose upon him by a lie in making a bargain_ which he had no fence against but by not believing you; and it will be no excuse from the guilt of robbery to say that he might choose whether he would believe you_ for that is a debt we should owe to all men,20250223
The nature of it. It is to be slow to anger_ not easily put into a passion_ nor apt to resent provocation_ taking time to consider before we suffer our passion to break out_ that it may not transgress due bounds_ so slow in our motions towards anger that we may be quickly stopped and pacified. It is to have the rule of our own spirits_ our appetites and affections_ and all our inclinations_ but particularly our passions_ our anger_ keeping that under direction and check_ and the strict government of religion and right reason. We must be lords of our anger_ as God is_ Nah. i,20250223
The nature of it; it is a song_ that it might the better answer the intention_ which is to stir up the affections and to heat them_ which poetry will be very instrumental to do. The subject is pleasing_ and therefore fit to be treated of in a song_ in singing which we may make melody with our hearts unto the Lord. It is evangelical; and gospel-times should be times of joy_ for gospel-grace puts a new song into our mouths_ Ps. xcviii. 1,20250223
The navel is here compared to a round cup or goblet_ that wants not any of the agreeable liquor that one would wish to find in it_ such as David's cup that ran over (Ps. xxiii. well shaped_ and not as that miserable infant whose navel was not cut_ Ezek. xvi,20250223
The neglect of husbandry is the way to poverty: Where no oxen are_ to till the ground and tread out the corn_ the crib is empty_ is clean; there is no straw for the cattle_ and consequently no bread for the service of man. Scarcity is represented by cleanness of teeth_ Amos iv,20250223
The noise thereof_ among other things_ shows concerning it. Hence we read (1 Kings xviii. 41) of the sound of abundance of rain_ or (as it is in the margin) a sound of a noise of rain_ before it came; and a welcome harbinger it was then. As the noise_ so the face of the sky_ shows concerning it_ Luke xii. 56. The cattle also_ by a strange instinct_ are apprehensive of a change in the weather nigh at hand_ and seek for shelter_ shaming man_ who will not foresee the evil and hide himself.,20250223
The nose is like the tower of Lebanon_ the forehead or face set like a flint (Isa. l. undaunted as that tower was impregnable. So it denotes the magnanimity and holy bravery of the church_ or (as others) a spiritual sagacity to discern things that differ_ as animals strangely distinguish by the smell. This tower looks towards Damascus_ the head city of Syria_ denoting the boldness of the church in facing its enemies and not fearing them.,20250223
The observance of justice in commerce between man and man is likewise a divine appointment. He taught men discretion to make scales and weights for the adjusting of right exactly between buyer and seller_ that neither may be wronged; and all other useful inventions for the preserving of right are from him. He has also appointed by his law that they be just. It is therefore a great affront to him_ and to his government_ to falsify_ and so to do wrong under colour and pretence of doing right_ which is wickedness in the place of judgment.,20250223
The obstinacy of many wicked people in a wicked way is to be greatly lamented. They are often reproved by parents and friends_ by magistrates and ministers_ by the providence of God and by their own consciences_ have had their sins set in order before them and fair warning given them of the consequences of them_ but all in vain; they harden their necks. Perhaps they fling away_ and will not so much as give the reproof a patient hearing; or_ if they do_ yet they go on in the sins for which they are reproved; they will not bow their necks to the yoke_ but are children of Belial; they refuse reproof (ch. x. despise it (ch. v. hate it_ ch. xii. 1,20250223
The ointments_ the odours wherewith she is perfumed_ the gifts and graces of the Spirit_ her good works_ which are an odour of a sweet smell_ a sacrifice acceptable_ well-pleasing to God_ Phil. iv.,20250223
The only way to have our thoughts established is to commit our works to the Lord. The great concerns of our souls must be committed to the grace of God_ with a dependence upon and submission to the conduct of that grace (2 Tim. i. 12); all our outward concerns must be committed to the providence of God_ and to the sovereign_ wise_ and gracious disposal of that providence. Roll thy works upon the Lord (so the word is); roll the burden of thy care from thyself upon God. Lay the matter before him by prayer.,20250223
The operations of second causes are commonly obvious to sense_ but God does all about us and yet we see him not_ Acts xvii,20250223
The opinion she has of him as the good shepherd of the sheep; she doubts not but he feeds his flock and makes them rest at noon. Jesus Christ graciously provides both repast and repose for his sheep; they are not starved_ but well fed_ not scattered upon the mountains_ but fed together_ fed in green pastures and in the hot time of the day led by the still waters and made to lie down under a cool refreshing shade. Is it with God's people a noon-time of outward troubles_ inward conflicts? Christ has rest for them; he carries them in his arms_ Isa. xl.,20250223
The opponents were Eliphaz_ Bildad_ and Zophar. ,20250223
The oppressed will find God their powerful patron. He will plead their cause_ and not suffer them to be run down and trampled upon. If men will not appear for them_ God will,20250223
The oppressors will find him a just avenger. He will make reprisals upon them_ will spoil the souls of those that spoil them; he will repay them in spiritual judgments_ in curses to their souls. He that robs the poor will be found in the end a murderer of himself.,20250223
The original here is difficult_ and differently understood. 1. Some take it as a rebuke to an affected singularity. When men take a pride in separating themselves from the sentiments and society of others_ in contradicting all that has been said before them and advancing new notions of their own_ which_ though ever so absurd_ they are wedded to_ it is to gratify a desire or lust of vain-glory_ and they are seekers and meddlers with that which does not belong to them. He seeks according to his desire_ and intermeddles with every business_ pretends to pass a judgment upon every man's matter. He is morose and supercilious. Those generally are so that are opinionative and conceited_ and they thus make themselves ridiculous_ and are vexatious to others,20250223
The ornaments she has from him_ that is_ the obedience she yields to him_ for that is the chain of her neck_ the graces that enrich her soul_ which are connected as links in chain_ the exercise of these graces in a conversation which adorns both herself and the doctrine of Jesus Christ_ which she professes to believe (as a gold chain is an ornament to persons of quality)_ and an entire submission to the commanding power of his love. Having shaken off the bands of our neck_ by which we were tied to this world (Isa. lii. and the yoke of our transgressions_ we are bound with the cords of love_ as chains of gold_ to Jesus Christ_ and our necks are brought under his sweet and easy yoke_ to drawn in it. This recommends us to Jesus Christ_ for this is that true wisdom which_ in his account_ is an ornament of grace unto the head and chains about the neck_ Prov. i,20250223
The ostrich is a wonderful animal_ a very large bird_ but it never flies. Some have called it a winged camel. God here gives an account of it_ and observes_,20250223
The parched ground in time of drought (especially in those hot countries)_ which still soaks in the rain that comes in abundance upon it and in a little time wants more,20250223
The particular instances of this cheerfulness prescribed: __Thou art drooping and melancholy_ go thy way_ like a fool as thou art_ and get into a better temper of mind.__ ,20250223
The patient_ being a penitent_ is a supplicant_ and has learned to pray. He knows God will be sought unto for his favours_ and therefore he shall pray unto God_ pray for pardon_ pray for health. Is any afflicted_ and sick? Let him pray. When he finds himself recovering he shall not then think that prayer is no longer necessary_ for we need the grace of God as much for the sanctifying of a mercy as for the sanctifying of an affliction. ,20250223
The peculiarity of this garden: It is a garden enclosed_ a paradise separated from the common earth. It is appropriated to God; he has set it apart for himself; Israel is God's portion_ the lot of his inheritance. It is enclosed for secresy; the saints are God's hidden ones_ therefore the world knows them not; Christ walks in his garden unseen. It is enclosed for safety; a hedge of protection is made about it_ which all the powers of darkness cannot either find or make a gap in. God's vineyard is fenced (Isa. v. 2); there is a wall about it_ a wall of fire. It has a spring in it_ and a fountain_ but it is a spring shut up and a fountain sealed_ which sends its streams abroad (Prov. v. but is itself carefully locked up_ that it may not by any injurious hand be muddied or polluted. The souls of believers are as gardens enclosed; grace in them is as a spring shut up there in the hidden man of the heart_ where the water that Christ gives is a well of living water_ John iv.,20250223
The penman of it; it is Solomon's. It is not the song of fools_ as many of the songs of love are_ but the song of the wisest of men; nor can any man give a better proof of his wisdom than to celebrate the love of God to mankind and to excite his own love to God and that of others with it. Solomon's songs were a thousand and five (1 Kings iv. 32); those that were of other subjects are lost_ but this of seraphic love remains_ and will to the end of time. Solomon_ like his father_ was addicted to poetry_ and_ which way soever a man's genius lies_ he should endeavor to honour God and edify the church with it. One of Solomon's names was Jedidiah—beloved of the Lord (2 Sam. xii. 25); and none so fit to write of the Lord's love as he that had himself so great an interest in it; none of all the apostles wrote so much of love as he that was himself the beloved disciple and lay in Christ's bosom. Solomon_ as a king_ had great affairs to mind and manage_ which took up much of his thoughts and time_ yet he found heart and leisure for this and other religious exercises. Men of business ought to be devout men_ and not to think that business will excuse them from that which is every man's great business—to keep up communion with God. It is not certain when Solomon penned this sacred song. Some think that he penned it after he recovered himself by the grace of God from his backslidings_ as a further proof of his repentance_ and as if by doing good to many with this song he would atone for the hurt he had perhaps done with loose_ vain_ amorous songs_ when he loved many strange wives; now he turned his wit the right way. It is more probable that he penned it in the beginning of his time_ while he kept close to God and kept up his communion with him; and perhaps he put this song_ with his father's psalms_ into the hands of the chief musician_ for the service of the temple_ not without a key to it_ for the right understanding of it. Some think that it was penned upon occasion of his marriage with Pharaoh's daughter_ but that is uncertain; the tower of Lebanon_ which is mentioned in this book (ch. vii. was not built_ as is supposed_ till long after the marriage. We may reasonably think that when in the height of his prosperity he loved the Lord (1 Kings iii. 3) he thus served him with joyfulness and gladness of heart in the abundance of all things. It may be rendered_ The song of songs_ which is concerning Solomon_ who as the son and successor of David_ on whom the covenant of royalty was entailed_ as the founder of the temple_ and as one that excelled in wisdom and wealth_ was a type of Christ_ in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge_ and yet is a greater than Solomon; this is therefore a song concerning him. It is here fitly placed after Ecclesiastes; for when by the book we are thoroughly convinced of the vanity of the creature_ and its insufficiency to satisfy us and make a happiness for us_ we shall be quickened to seek for happiness in the love of Christ_ and that true transcendent pleasure which is to be found only in communion with God through him. The voice in the wilderness_ that was to prepare Christ's way_ cried_ All flesh is grass.,20250223
The people are idle_ or they play_ as the scholars are apt to do when the master is absent; they do nothing to any good purpose_ but stand all the day idle_ and sporting in the market-place_ for want of instruction what to do and how to do it,20250223
The people will actually rejoice or mourn according as their rulers are righteous or wicked. Such a conviction are even the common people under of the excellency of virtue and religion that they will rejoice when they see them preferred and countenanced; and_ on the contrary_ let men have ever so much honour or power_ if they be wicked and vicious_ and use it ill_ they make themselves contemptible and base before all the people (as those priests_ Mal. ii. 9) and subjects will think themselves miserable under such a government.,20250223
The perfection of God's knowledge. It is one of the most glorious perfections of God that he is perfect in knowledge; he is omniscient.,20250223
The peril of a sinful way. There is not only a punishment at the end of it_ but a snare in it. One sin is a temptation to another_ and there are troubles which_ as a snare_ come suddenly upon evil men in the midst of their transgressions; nay_ their transgression itself often involves them in vexations; their sin is their punishment_ and they are holden in the cords of their own iniquity_ ch. v. 22,20250223
The permission God gave to Satan to afflict Job for the trial of his sincerity. Satan desired God to do it: Put forth thy hand now. God allowed him to do it (v. 12): __All that he has is in thy hand; make the trial as sharp as thou canst; do thy worst at him.__ Now,20250223
The place of it_ for that is undiscoverable. Where shall wisdom be found? v,20250223
The plaintiff having done his evidence_ it is fit that the defendant should be heard_ should have leave to confront the witnesses and cross-examine them_ and show the falsehood and fallacy of what has been alleged_ which perhaps may make the matter appear quite otherwise than it did. We must therefore remember that we have two ears_ to hear both sides before we give judgment.,20250223
The plea she uses for the enforcing of this request: __For why should I be as one that turns aside by (or after) the flocks of thy companions_ that pretend to be so_ but are really thy competitors_ and rivals with thee.__ Note_ Turning aside from Christ after other lovers is that which gracious souls dread_ and deprecate_ more than any thing else. __Thou wouldst not have me to turn aside_ no_ nor to be as one that turns aside; tell me then_ O tell me_ where I may be near thee_ and I will never leave thee.__ ,20250223
The pleasant words here commended must be those which the heart of the wise teaches_ and adds learning to (v. words of seasonable advice_ instruction_ and comfort_ words taken from God's word_ for that is it which Solomon had learned from his father to account sweeter than honey and the honey-comb_ Ps. xix,20250223
The pleasantness of the way of holiness. The snare that is in the transgression of evil men spoils all their mirth_ but righteous men are kept from those snares_ or delivered out of them; they walk at liberty_ walk in safety_ and therefore they sing and rejoice. Those that make God their chief joy have him for their exceeding joy_ and it is their own fault if they do not rejoice evermore. If there be any true joy on this side heaven_ doubtless those have it whose conversation is in heaven.,20250223
The pleasure and satisfaction which the righteous shall have in this. ,20250223
The pleasures of sense seem right to the carnal appetite_ and go down smoothly_ but they are often wrong_ and_ compared with the pleasure of communion with God_ they are harsh and rough. Nothing goes down so sweetly with a gracious soul as the wine of God's consolations. ,20250223
The policy of tyrants. When they aim to set up themselves they sometimes make use of religion as a cloak and cover for their ambition and by their hypocrisy come to the throne. ,20250223
The policy that is commonly used in giving and receiving bribes. It must be a gift in secret and a reward in the bosom_ for he that takes it would not be thought to covet it_ nor known to receive it_ nor would he willingly be beholden to him whom he has been offended with; but_ if it be done privately_ all is well. No man should be too open in giving any gift_ nor boast of the presents he sends; but_ if it be a bribe to pervert justice_ that is so scandalous that those who are fond of it are ashamed of it.,20250223
The power and force with which those admonitions come_ v,20250223
The power of sinners cannot secure them against God_ though they strengthen themselves with body hands. Though they may strengthen one another with their confederacies and combinations_ joining forces against God_ they shall not escape his righteous judgment. Woe unto him that strives with his Maker_ ch. xi. 21; Isa. xlv. 9.,20250223
The power that is commonly found to be in gifts. Nothing is more violent than anger. O the force of strong wrath! And yet a handsome present_ prudently managed_ will turn away some men's wrath when it seemed implacable_ and disarm the keenest and most passionate resentments. Covetousness is commonly a master-sin and has the command of other lusts. Pecuniæ obediunt omnia—Money commands all things. Thus Jacob pacified Esau and Abigail David,20250223
The praise of him that is conscientious: He who hears (that is_ obeys) the command of God_ which is to speak every man truth with his neighbour_ he who testifies nothing but what he has heard and knows to be true_ speaks constantly (that is_ consistently with himself); he is always in the same story; he speaks in finem—to the end; people will give credit to him and hear him out; he speaks unto victory; he carries the cause_ which the false witness shall lose; he shall speak to eternity. What is true is true eternally. The lip of truth is established for ever.,20250223
The prayer itself. The two things he requires are grace sufficient and food convenient. 1. Grace sufficient for his soul: __Remove from me vanity and lies; deliver me from sin_ from all corrupt principles_ practices_ and affections_ from error and mistake_ which are at the bottom of all sin_ from the love of the world and the things of it_ which are all vanity and a lie.__ Some understand it as a prayer for the pardon of sin_ for_ when God forgives sin_ he removes it_ he takes it away. Or_ rather_ it is a prayer of the same import with that_ Lead us not into temptation. Nothing is more mischievous to us than sin_ and therefore there is nothing which we should more earnestly pray against than that we may do no evil,20250223
The preacher here further shows the vanity and folly of heaping up worldly wealth and expecting happiness in it.,20250223
The preacher here_ for a further proof of the vanity of the world_ and to convince us that all our works are in the hand of God_ and not in our own hand_ shows the uncertainty and contingency of future events_ and how often they contradict the prospects we have of them. He had exhorted us,20250223
The preacher_ to enforce his admonition both to old and young_ urges_ as an effectual argument_ that which is the great argument of his discourse_ the vanity of all present things_ their uncertainty and insufficiency. 1. He reminds old people of this (v. 8): All that comes is vanity; yea_ though a man live many years and rejoice in them all_ All that has come already_ and all that is yet to come_ how much soever men promise themselves from the concluding scenes_ it is all vanity. What will be will do no more to make men happy than what has been. All that come into the world are vanity; they are altogether so_ at their best estate,20250223
The precept is plain: Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of the reproofs that are given us for that which is evil if we do not turn from it to that which is good; for for this end the reproof was given. Turn_ that is_ return to your right mind_ turn to God_ turn to your duty_ turn and live. ,20250223
The preference which the preacher gives to an untimely birth before him: An untimely birth_ a child that is carried from the womb to the grave_ is better than he. Better is the fruit that drops from the tree before it is ripe than that which is left to hang on till it is rotten. Job_ in his passion_ thinks the condition of an untimely birth better than his when he was in adversity (Job iii. 16); but Solomon here pronounces it better than the condition of a worldling in his greatest prosperity_ when the world smiles upon him. 1. He grants the condition of an untimely birth_ upon many accounts_ to be very sad (v. 4_ 5): He comes in with vanity (for_ as to this world_ he that is born and dies immediately was born in vain)_ and he departs in darkness; little or no notice is taken of him; being an abortive_ he has no name_ or_ if he had_ it would soon be forgotten and buried in oblivion; it would be covered with darkness_ as the body is with the earth. Nay (v. he has not seen the sun_ but from the darkness of the womb he is hurried immediately to that of the grave_ and_ which is worse than not being known to any_ he has not known any thing_ and therefore has come short of that which is the greatest pleasure and honour of man. Those that live in wilful ignorance_ and know nothing to purpose_ are no better than an untimely birth that has not seen the sun nor known any thing,20250223
The preferment such a man stands fair for: The king_ if he be wise and good_ and understand his own and his people's interest_ will be his friend_ will make him of his cabinet-council_ as there was one in David's court_ and another in Solomon's_ that was called the king's friend; or_ in any business that he has_ the king will befriend him. Some understand it of the King of kings. A man in whose spirit there is no guile_ and whose speech is always with grace_ God will be his friend_ Messiah_ the Prince_ will be his friend. This honour have all the saints.,20250223
The prejudice he sustains by his slothfulness. He himself is the loser by it_ for he starves himself: It grieves him to bring his hand to his mouth_ that is_ he cannot find in his heart to feed himself_ but dreads_ as if it were a mighty toil_ to lift his hand to his head. It is an elegant hyperbole_ aggravating his sin_ that he cannot endure to take the least pains_ no_ not for the greatest profit_ and showing how his sin is his punishment. Those that are slothful in the business of religion will not be at the pains to feed their own souls with the word of God_ the bread of life_ nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer_ though they might have them for the fetching.,20250223
The preparatives for that destruction represented under the similitude of a beast or bird caught in a snare_ or a malefactor arrested and taken into custody in order to his punishment_ v. 7-10. 1. Satan is preparing for his destruction. He is the robber that shall prevail against him (v.,20250223
The preserving of so much wisdom and piety among those that were strangers to the covenants of promise was a happy presage of God's grace to the Gentiles_ when the partition-wall should in the latter days be taken down. Esau was rejected; yet many that came from him inherited some of the best blessings.,20250223
The presumption and impudence of a wicked man: He hardens his face—brazens it_ that he may not blush—steels it_ that he may not tremble when he commits the greatest crimes; he bids defiance to the terrors of the law and the checks of his own conscience_ the reproofs of the word and the rebukes of Providence; he will have his way and nothing shall hinder him_ Isa. lvii.,20250223
The pride of hypocrites. They aim to reign; the praise of men_ and power in the world_ are their reward_ what they aim at. ,20250223
The pride of sinners sets God against them. He that_ being high in estate is proud in heart_ whose spirit is elevated with his condition_ so that he becomes insolent in his conduct towards God and man_ let him know that though he admires himself_ and others caress him_ yet he is an abomination to the Lord. The great God despises him; the holy God detest him,20250223
The principles by which Job was restrained from all uncharitableness and unmercifulness. He durst not abuse the poor; for though_ with his help in the gate_ he could overpower them_ yet he could not make his part good against that God who is the patron of oppressed poverty and will not let oppressors go unpunished (v. 23): __Destruction from God was a terror to me_ whenever I was tempted to this sin_ and by reason of his highness I could not endure the thought of making him my enemy.__ He stood in awe,20250223

The products of this garden. It is as the garden of Eden_ where the Lord God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food_ Gen. ii,20250223
The promises are very encouraging. Those that love simplicity find themselves under a moral impotency to change their own mind and way; they cannot turn by any power of their own. To this God answers_ __Behold_ I will pour out my Spirit unto you; set yourselves to do what you can_ and the grace of God shall set in with you_ and work in you both to will and to do that good which_ without that grace_ you could not do.__ Help thyself_ and God will help thee; stretch forth thy withered hand_ and Christ will strengthen and heal it. ,20250223
The proof Satan undertakes to give of the hypocrisy and mercenariness of Job's religion_ if he might but have leave to strip him of his wealth. __Let it be put to this issue___ says he (v. 11); __make him poor_ frown upon him_ turn thy hand against him_ and then see where his religion will be; touch what he has and it will appear what he is. If he curse thee not to thy face_ let me never be believed_ but posted for a liar and false accuser. Let me perish if he curse thee not;__ so some supply the imprecation_ which the devil himself modestly concealed_ but the profane swearers of our age impudently and daringly speak out. Observe,20250223
The proof and illustration of it by the induction of particulars_ twenty-eight in number_ according to the days of the moon's revolution_ which is always increasing or decreasing between its full and change. Some of these changes are purely the act of God_ others depend more upon the will of man_ but all are determined by the divine counsel. Every thing under heaven is thus changeable_ but in heaven there is an unchangeable state_ and an unchangeable counsel concerning these things. 1. There is a time to be born and a time to die. These are determined by the divine counsel; and_ as we were born_ so we must die_ at the time appointed_ Acts xvii,20250223

Guard thus against the temptations of youth_ and thus improve the advantages of it.__,20250223
The prosecutor is called_ the plaintiff summoned_ and ordered to bring in his information_ to say what he has to say against the prisoner_ for he stands upon his deliverance: __O that my adversary had written a book—that my friends_ who charge me with hypocrisy_ would draw up their charge in writing_ that it might be reduced to a certainty_ and that we might the better join issue upon it.__ Job would be very glad to see the libel_ to have a copy of his indictment. He would not hide it under his arm_ but take it upon his shoulder_ to be seen and read of all men_ nay_ he would bind it as a crown to him_ would be pleased with it_ and look upon it as his ornament; for_,20250223
The prosperity of the wicked shall quickly end_ but the happiness of the righteous shall never end_ v,20250223
The protestation which Eliphaz makes against the principles and practices of those wicked people: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me. Job had said so (ch. xxi. 16) and Eliphaz will not be behind him. If they cannot agree in their own principles concerning God_ yet they agree in renouncing the principles of those that live without God in the world. Note_ Those that differ from each other in some matters of religion_ and are engaged in disputes about them_ yet ought unanimously and vigorously to appear against atheism and irreligion_ and to take care that their disputes do not hinder either their vigour or unanimity in that common cause of God_ that righteous cause,20250223
The proverbs were Solomon's_ who was divinely inspired to deliver_ for the use of the church_ these wise and weighty sentences; we have had many_ but still there are more. Yet herein Christ is greater than Solomon_ for if we had all upon record that Christ said_ and did_ that was instructive_ the world could not contain the books that would be written_ John xxi. 25,20250223
The provision made for his instruction_ in order to a sanctified use of his affliction_ that_ when God in that way speaks to man_ he may be heard and understood_ and not speak in vain_ v.,20250223
The provocation which that pleasure gives to God is assigned as the reason of that prohibition: The Lord will see it_ though it be hidden in the heart only_ and it will displease him_ as it will displease a prudent father to see one child triumph in the correction of another_ which he ought to tremble at_ and take warning by_ not knowing how soon it may be his own case_ he having so often deserved it. Solomon adds an argument ad hominem—addressed to the individual: __Thou canst not do a greater kindness to thy enemy_ when he has fallen_ than to rejoice in it; for them_ to cross thee and vex thee_ God will turn his wrath from him; for_ as the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God_ so the righteousness of God was never intended to gratify the wrath of man_ and humour his foolish passions; rather than seem to do that he will adjourn the execution of his wrath: nay_ it is implied that when he turns his wrath from him he will turn it against thee and the cup of trembling shall be put into thy hand.__,20250223
The publishers were Hezekiah's servants_ who_ it is likely_ herein acted as his servants_ being appointed by him to do this good service to the church_ among other good offices that he did in the law and in the commandments_ 2 Chron. xxxi,20250223
The punishment of an epicure in this world: He shall be a poor man; for the lusts of sensuality are not maintained but at great expense_ and there are instances of those who want necessaries_ and live upon alms_ who once could not live without dainties and varieties.

The punishment of scorners will be a means of good to others. When men are so hardened in wickedness that they will not themselves be wrought upon by the severe methods that are used to reclaim and reform them_ yet such methods must be used for the sake of others_ that they may hear and fear_ Deut. xix,20250223
The qualification of an accomplished_ a complete gentleman_ that is fit to be employed in public business. He must be an honest man_ a man that loves pureness of heart and hates all impurity_ not only pure from all fleshly lusts_ but from all deceit and dissimulation_ from all selfishness and sinister designs_ that takes care to approve himself a man of sincerity_ is just and fair from principle_ and delights in nothing more than in keeping his own conscience clean and void of offence. He must also be able to speak with a good grace_ not to daub and flatter_ but to deliver his sentiments decently and ingeniously_ in language clean and smooth as his spirit,20250223
The qualifications necessary to this cheerfulness: __Rejoice and have a merry heart_ if God now accepts thy works. If thou art reconciled to God_ and recommended to him_ then thou has reason to be cheerful_ otherwise not.__ Rejoice not_ O Israel! for joy_ as other people_ for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God_ Hos. ix. 1. Our first care must be to make our peace with God_ and obtain his favour_ to do that which he will accept of_ and then_ Go thy way_ eat thy bread with joy. Note_ Those whose works God has accepted have reason to be cheerful and ought to be so. 'Now that thou eatest the bread of thy sacrifices with joy_ and partakest of the wine of thy drink-offerings with a merry heart_ now God accepts thy works. Thy religious services_ when performed with holy joy_ are pleasing to God; he loves to have his servants sing at their work_ it proclaims him a good Master.,20250223
The question which Job had asked (v. 12) he asks again here; for it is too worthy_ too weighty_ to be let fall_ until we speed in the enquiry. Concerning this we must seek till we find_ till we get some satisfactory account of it. By a diligent prosecution of this enquiry he brings it_ at length_ to this issue_ that there is a twofold wisdom_ one hidden in God_ which is secret and belongs not to us_ the other made known by him and revealed to man_ which belongs to us and to our children.,20250223

The rain is over and gone_ the winter-rain_ the cold stormy rain; it is over now_ and the dew is as the dew of herbs.

The reason he gives why this has more rest is because all go to one place to rest in_ and this is sooner at his rest_ v,20250223
The reason why hypocrites do not persevere in religion is because they have no pleasure in it. Those that do not delight in the Almighty will not always call upon him. The more comfort we find in our religion the more closely we shall cleave to it. Those who have no delight in God are easily inveigled by the pleasures of sense_ and so drawn away from their religion; and they are easily run down by the crosses of this life_ and so driven away from their religion_ and will not always call upon God.,20250223

The reason why some people seek wisdom_ and do not find it_ is because they do not seek it from a right principle and in a right manner. They are scorners_ and it is in scorn that they ask instruction_ that they may ridicule what is told them and may cavil at it. Many put questions to Christ_ tempting him_ and that they might have whereof to accuse him_ but they were never the wiser. No marvel if those who seek wisdom_ as Simon Magus sought the gifts of the Holy Ghost_ to serve their pride and covetousness_ do not find it_ for they seek amiss. Herod desired to see a miracle_ but he was a scorner_ and therefore it was denied him_ Luke xxiii,20250223

The reasons with which it is pressed upon us. Consider,20250223
The redeemer is the eternal Word and wisdom_ the Logos. He is the Wisdom that speaks to the children of men in the former part of the chapter. All divine revelation passes through his hand_ and centres in him; but of him as the personal Wisdom_ the second person in the Godhead_ in the judgment of many of the ancients_ Solomon here speaks_ ver. 22-31. He concludes with a repeated charge to the children of men diligently to attend to the voice of God in his word_ ver. 32-36.,20250223
The reference that this has to his slothfulness. It is the sluggard_ above all men_ that is thus self-conceited; for_ ,20250223
The reflections which he made upon it. He paused a little and considered it_ looked again upon it_ and received instruction. He did not break out into any passionate censures of the owner_ did not call him any ill names_ but he endeavoured himself to get good by the observation and to be quickened by it to diligence. Note_ Those that are to give instruction to others must receive instruction themselves_ and instruction may be received_ not only from what we read and hear_ but from what we see_ not only from what we see of the works of God_ but from what we see of the manners of man_ not only from men's good manners_ but from their evil manners. Plutarch relates a saying of Cato Major_ __That wise men profit more by fools than fools by wise men; for wise men will avoid the faults of fools_ but fools will not imitate the virtues of wise men.__ Solomon reckoned that he received instruction by this sight_ though it did not suggest to him any new notion or lesson_ but only put him in mind of an observation he himself had formerly made_ both of the ridiculous folly of the sluggard (who_ when he has needful work to do_ lies dozing in bed and cries_ Yet a little sleep_ a little slumber_ and still it will be a little more_ till he has slept his eyes out_ and_ instead of being fitted by sleep for business_ as wise men are_ he is dulled_ and stupefied_ and made good for nothing) and of certain misery that attends him: his poverty comes as one that travels; it is constantly coming nearer and nearer to him_ and will be upon him speedily_ and want seizes him as irresistibly as an armed man_ a highwayman that will strip him of all he has. Now this is applicable_ not only to our worldly business_ to show what a scandalous thing slothfulness in that is_ and how injurious to the family_ but to the affairs of our souls. Note_ ,20250223
The regard she has to him: Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thy eyes_ those doves' eyes_ clear and chaste (which were commended_ v. 1)_ with one glance of those eyes. Christ is wonderfully pleased with those that look unto him as their Saviour_ and through the eye of faith dart their affections to him_ above any rival whatsoever_ and whose eyes are ever towards him; he is soon aware of the first look of a soul towards him and meets it with his favours. ,20250223
The repetition denotes backwardness in her (we have need to be often called to come away with Jesus Christ; precept must be upon precept and line upon line)_ but it denotes earnestness in him; so much is his heart set upon the welfare of precious souls that he importunes them most pressingly to that which is for their own good.,20250223
The reproof of wise men will be a means of good to themselves. They need not be smitten; a word to the wise is enough. Do but reprove one that has understanding and he will so far understand himself and his own interest that he will understand knowledge by it_ and not miss it again through ignorance and inadvertency when once he has been told of it; so kindly does he take reproof and so wisely improve it.,20250223
The reproofs Job here gives to his friends_ whether they were just or no_ were very sharp_ and may serve for a rebuke to all that are proud and scornful_ and an exposure of their folly.,20250223
The reputation that is got with difficulty_ and by a great deal of wisdom_ may be easily lost_ and by a little folly_ because envy fastens upon eminency_ and makes the worst of the mistakes and miscarriages of those who are cried up for wisdom_ and improves them to their disadvantage; so that the folly which in another would not be taken notice of in them is severely censured. Those who make a great profession of religion have need to walk very circumspectly_ to abstain from all appearances of evil_ and approaches towards it_ because many eyes are upon them_ that watch for their halting; their character is soon sullied_ and they have a great deal of reputation to lose.,20250223
The respectful title they give to the spouse: O thou fairest among women! Our Lord Jesus makes his spouse truly amiable_ not only in his eyes_ but in the eyes of all the daughters of Jerusalem. The church is the most excellent society in the world_ the communion of saints the best communion_ and the beauty of the sanctuary a transcendent beauty. The saints are the most excellent people; holiness is the symmetry of the soul; it is its agreement with itself; it recommends itself to all that are competent judges of it. Even those that have little acquaintance with Christ_ as those daughters of Jerusalem here_ cannot but see an amiable beauty in those that bear his image_ which we should love wherever we see it_ though in different dresses,20250223
The respondent was Job. ,20250223
The rest of Bildad's discourse is entirely taken up in an elegant description of the miserable condition of a wicked man_ in which there is a great deal of certain truth_ and which will be of excellent use if duly considered—that a sinful condition is a sad condition_ and that iniquity will be men's ruin if they do not repent of it. But it is not true that all wicked people are visibly and openly made thus miserable in this world; nor is it true that all who are brought into great distress and trouble in this world are therefore to be deemed and adjudged wicked men_ when no other proof appears against them; and therefore_ though Bildad thought the application of it to Job was easy_ yet it was not safe nor just. In these verses we have_,20250223
The rich man in hell begged_ but was denied. ,20250223
The righteous Lord so loves righteousness that_ in comparison with him_ even Job himself_ though a perfect and upright man_ might be said to hate right; and shall he govern? Shall he pretend to direct God or correct what he does? Shall such unrighteous creatures as we are give law to the righteous God? or must he take his measures from us? When we consider the corruption of our nature_ and the contrariety there is in us to the eternal rule of equity_ we cannot but see it to be an impudent impious thing for us to prescribe to God,20250223
The righteous are clean_ have clean hands and pure hearts; the wicked are unclean_ under the dominion of unclean lusts_ pure perhaps in their own eyes_ but not cleansed from their filthiness_ God will certainly put a difference between the clean and the unclean_ the precious and the vile_ in the other world_ though he does not seem to do so in this. ,20250223
The righteous are good_ good in God's sight_ they do good in the world; the wicked are sinners_ violating the laws of God and man_ and provoking to both. ,20250223
The righteous extricating themselves out of trouble by their own wisdom_ when God in mercy comes in for their succour: The just shall come out of such troubles as the wicked throw themselves headlong into. It is intimated that the just may perhaps come into trouble; but_ though they fall_ they shall not be utterly cast down_ Ps. xxxiv. 19.,20250223
The righteous is the pillar of the world (so some read it); the world stands for their sakes; the holy seed is the substance thereof.,20250223
The righteous man_ whose ruin was expected_ recovers himself. He falls seven times into trouble_ but_ by the blessing of God upon his wisdom and integrity_ he rises again_ sees through his troubles and sees better times after them. The just man falls_ sometimes falls seven times perhaps_ into sin_ sins of infirmity_ through the surprise of temptation; but he rises again by repentance_ finds mercy with God_ and regains his peace. ,20250223
The righteous sacrifice_ that is_ they make conscience of worshipping God according to his will_ both with inward and outward worship; the wicked sacrifice not_ that is_ they live in the neglect of God's worship and grudge to part with any thing for his honour. What is the Almighty_ that they should serve him? ,20250223
The righteous_ it is true_ sometimes have their fears_ but their desire is towards the favour of God and a happiness in him_ and that desire shall be granted. According to their faith_ not according to their fear_ it shall be unto them_ Ps. xxxvii. 4.,20250223
The righteous_ on the contrary_ make no show; they lie hid_ like a foundation_ which is low and out of sight_ but they are fixed in their resolution to cleave to God_ established in virtue_ and they shall be an everlasting foundation_ immovably good. He that is holy shall be holy still and immovably happy; his hope is built on a rock_ and therefore not shocked by the storm_ Matt. vii,20250223
The rolling waves_ the impending rocks_ the hovering clouds_ and the ships under sail with top and top-gallant_ this mighty animal beholds with contempt_ for he does not think they either lessen him or threaten him. Those that are great are apt to be scornful. ,20250223
The royal preacher goes on further to show the vanity of worldly wealth_ when men place their happiness in it and are eager and inordinate in laying it up. Riches_ in the hands of a man that is wise and generous_ and good for something_ but in the hands of a sordid_ sneaking_ covetous miser_ they are good for nothing. 1.

The ruin of those sinners (v. 16): They were cut down out of time; that is_ they were cut off in the midst of their days_ when_ as man's time then went_ many of them might_ in the course of nature_ have lived some hundreds of years longer_ which made their immature extirpation the more grievous. They were cut down out of time_ to be hurried into eternity.

The rule of religion is the law of God revealed in the scriptures. Our fear towards God must be taught by his commandments (Isa. xxix. and those we must keep and carefully observe. Wherever the fear of God is uppermost in the heart_ there will be a respect to all his commandments and care to keep them. In vain do we pretend to fear God if we do not make conscience of our duty to him.,20250223
The safety of innocency. He that is cursed without cause_ whether by furious imprecations or solemn anathemas_ the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head_ than Goliath's curses did to David_ 1 Sam. xvii,20250223
The saints' security in God. It is a strong tower to those who know how to make use of it as such. The righteous_ by faith and prayer_ devotion towards God and dependence on him_ run into it_ as their city of refuge. Having made sure their interest in God's name_ they take the comfort and benefit of it; they go out of themselves_ retire from the world_ live above_ dwell in God and God in them_ and so they are safe_ they think themselves so_ and they shall find themselves so.,20250223
The saw him looking through the windows of the ceremonial institutions and smiling through those lattices; in their sacrifices and purifications Christ discovered himself to them_ and gave them intimations and earnests of his grace_ both to engage and to encourage their longings for his coming. Such is our present state in comparison with what it will be at Christ's second coming. We now see him through a glass darkly (the body is a wall between us and him_ through the windows of which we now and then get a sight of him)_ but not face to face_ as we hope to see him shortly. In the sacraments Christ is near us_ but it is behind the wall of external signs_ through those lattices he manifests himself to us; but we shall shortly see him as he is. Some understand this of the state of a believer when he is under a cloud; Christ is out of sight and yet not far off. See Job xxxiv. 14_ and compare Job xxiii. 8-10. She calls the wall that interposed between her and her beloved our wall_ because it is sin_ and nothing else_ that separates between us and God_ and that is a wall of our own erecting (Isa. lix. 1); behind that he stands_ as waiting to be gracious_ and ready to be reconciled_ upon our repentance. Then he looks in at the window_ observes the frame of our hearts and the working of our souls; he looks forth at the window_ and shows himself in giving them some comfort_ that they may continue hoping for his return.,20250223
The scope of Elihu's discourse to reconcile Job to his afflictions and to pacify his spirit under them. In order to this he had shown_ in the foregoing chapter_ that God meant him no hurt in afflicting him_ but intended it for his spiritual benefit. In this chapter he shows that he did him no wrong in afflicting him_ nor punished him more than he deserved. If the former could not prevail to satisfy him_ yet this ought to silence him. In these verses he directs his discourse to all the company: __Hearken to me_ you men of understanding (v. and show yourselves to be intelligent by assenting to this which I say.__ And this is that which he says_ That the righteous God never did_ nor ever will do_ any wrong to any of his creatures_ but his ways are equal_ ours are unequal. The truth here maintained respects the justice of equity of all God's proceedings. Now observe in these verses_,20250223
The scope of these verses is to keep subjects loyal and dutiful to the government. In Solomon's reign the people were very rich_ and lived in prosperity_ which perhaps made them proud and petulant_ and when the taxes were high_ though they had enough to pay them with_ it is probable that many conducted themselves insolently towards the government and threatened to rebel. To such Solomon here gives some necessary cautions.,20250223
The scope of these verses is to show,20250223
The scope of this chapter is much the same with that of ch. ii. To write the same things_ in other words_ ought not to be grievous_ for it is safe_ Phil. iii. 1. Here is_,20250223
The scope of this chapter is_ as of several before_ to warn young men against the lusts of the flesh. Solomon remembered of what ill consequence it was to his father_ perhaps found himself_ and perceived his son_ addicted to it_ or at least had observed how many hopeful young men among his subjects had been ruined by those lusts; and therefore he thought he could never say enough to dissuade men from them_ that __every one may possess his vessel in sanctification and honour_ and not in the lusts of uncleanness.__ In this chapter we have_,20250223
The season is elegantly described in a great variety of expressions. ,20250223
The sense of his calamities was continually preying upon his spirits without any intermission. He went mourning from day to day_ always sighing_ always weeping; and such cloud was constantly upon his mind that he went_ in effect_ without the sun_ v,20250223
The sense of the patriarchal age concerning good and evil and what was so long ago condemned as sinful_ that is_ both hateful and hurtful,20250223
The sentence is pronounced_ and it is certainly ruining. Those that will not submit to God's government will certainly perish under his wrath and curse_ and the gospel itself will not relieve them. They would not take the benefit of God's mercy when it was offered them_ and therefore justly fall as victims to his justice_ ch. xxix. 1. The threatenings here will have their full accomplishment in the judgment of the great day and the eternal misery of the impenitent_ of which yet there are some earnests in present judgments. ,20250223
The services of the best saints are no profit to him (v. 7): If thou be righteous_ what givest thou to him? He needs not our service; or_ if he did want to have the work done_ he has better hands than ours at command. Our religion brings no accession at all to his felicity. He is so far from being beholden to us that we are beholden to him for making us righteous and accepting our righteousness; and therefore we can demand nothing from him_ nor have any reason to complain if we have not what we expect_ but to be thankful that we have better than we deserve.,20250223
The severity of his rebukes and displeasure against them (v. 10): __If you do accept persons_ though but secretly and in heart_ he will surely reprove you; he will be so far from being pleased with your censures of me_ though under colour of vindicating him_ that he will resent them as a great provocation_ as any prince or great man would if a base action were done under the sanction of his name and under the colour of advancing his interest.__ Note_ What we do amiss we shall certainly be reproved for_ one way or other_ one time or other_ though it be done ever so secretly. ,20250223
The shame and ruin of the disobedient_ that will not be governed_ nor endure any yoke_ that will not be taught_ nor take any advice. They are fools_ for they act against themselves and their own interest; they are commonly prating fools_ fools of lips_ full of talk_ but full of nonsense_ boasting of themselves_ prating spitefully against those that admonish them (3 John and pretending to give counsel and law to others. Of all fools_ none more troublesome than the prating fools_ nor that more expose themselves; but they shall fall into sin_ into hell_ because they received not commandments. Those that are full of tongue seldom look well to their feet_ and therefore stumble and fall.,20250223
The shame and ruin of those that slight it: __If thou scornest Wisdom's proffer_ thou alone shalt bar it.__ ,20250223
The shame of a prodigal son. It is a shame to himself that he should be so brutish and unnatural. He makes himself odious to all mankind. It is a shame to his parents and family_ who are reflected upon_ though_ perhaps_ without just cause_ for teaching him no better_ or being in some way wanting to him.,20250223
The sight of them is vanity and vexation of spirit to the wise observer of them. The more we see of the world the more we see to make us uneasy_ and_ with Heraclitus_ to look upon all with weeping eyes. Solomon especially perceived that the knowledge of wisdom and folly was vexation of spirit_ v,20250223
The similitudes here seem to be elegantly transposed. 1. The well-spring of wisdom is as deep waters. An intelligent knowing man has in him a good treasure of useful things_ which furnishes him with something to say upon all occasions that is pertinent and profitable. This is as deep waters_ which make no noise_ but never run dry,20250223
The sin condemned is bearing false witness against our neighbour_ either in judgment or in common conversation_ contrary to the law of the ninth commandment,20250223
The sin of a prodigal son. Besides the wrong he does to himself_ he is injurious to his good parents_ and basely ungrateful to those that were instruments of his being and have taken so much care and pains about him_ which is a great aggravation of his sin and renders it exceedingly sinful in the eyes of God and man: He wastes is father_ wastes his estate which he should have to support him in his old age_ wastes his spirits_ and breaks his heart_ and brings his gray head with sorrow to the grave. He chases away his mother_ alienates her affections from him_ which cannot be done without a great deal of regret and uneasiness to her; he makes her weary of the house_ with his rudeness and insolence_ and glad to retire for a little quietness; and_ when he has spent all_ he turns her out of doors,20250223
The sin of those sinners_ which brought that ruin (v. 17): They said unto God_ Depart from us. Job had spoken of some who said so and yet prospered_ ch. xxi,20250223
The sin we are here warned against is luxury and sensuality_ and the indulgence of the appetite in eating and drinking_ a sin that most easily besets us. 1. We are here told when we enter into temptation_ and are in most danger of falling into this sin: __When thou sittest to eat with a ruler thou has great plenty before thee_ varieties and dainties_ such a table spread as thou has seldom seen; thou are ready to think_ as Haman did_ of nothing but the honour hereby done thee (Esth. v.,20250223
The singing of the birds may shame our silence in God's praises_ who are better fed (Matt. vi. and better taught (Job xxxv. and are of more value than many sparrows. They live without inordinate care (Matt. vi.,20250223
The sinner at his rest_ or rather his ruin: He shall remain (quiescet—he shall rest_ but not in pace—in peace) in the congregation of the giants_ the sinners of the old world_ that were swept away by the deluge; to that destruction the damnation of sinners is compared_ as sometimes to the destruction of Sodom_ when they are said to have their portion in fire and brimstone. Or in the congregation of the damned_ that are under the power of the second death. There is a vast congregation of damned sinners_ bound in bundles for the fire_ and in that those shall remain_ remain for ever_ who are shut out from the congregation of the righteous. He that forsakes the way to heaven_ if he return not to it_ will certainly sink into the depths of hell.,20250223
The sinner is here supposed_ ,20250223
The sinner may as soon overpower the divine omnipotence as flee from the divine omniscience_ Amos ix. 2_ 3. No marvel that the sinner is dispirited and distracted with fear_ for,20250223
The sinner upon his ramble: He wanders out of the way of understanding_ and when once he has left that good way he wanders endlessly. The way of religion is the way of understanding; those that are not truly pious are not truly intelligent; those that wander out of this way break the hedge which God has set_ and follow the conduct of the world and the flesh; and they go astray like lost sheep,20250223
The sins from which he here acquits himself are,20250223
The sins of the worst sinners are no damage to him (v. 6): __If thou sinnest wilfully_ and of malice prepense_ against him_ with a high hand_ nay_ if thy transgressions be multiplied_ and the acts of sin be ever so often repeated_ yet what doest thou against him?__ This is a challenge to the carnal mind_ and defies the most daring sinner to do his worst. It speaks much for the greatness and glory of God that it is not in the power of his worst enemies to do him any real prejudice. Sin is said to be against God because so the sinner intends it and so God takes it_ and it is an injury to his honour; yet it cannot do any thing against him. The malice of sinners is impotent malice: it cannot destroy his being or perfections_ cannot dethrone him from his power and dominion_ cannot disturb his peace and repose_ cannot defeat his counsels and designs_ nor can it derogate from his essential glory. Job therefore spoke amiss in saying What profit is it that I am cleansed from my sin? God was no gainer by his reformation; and who then would gain if he himself did not? ,20250223
The sins threatened—bearing false witness in judgment and speaking lies in common conversation. Men could not arrive at such a pitch of impiety as to bear false witness (where to the guilt of a lie is added that of perjury and injury) if they had not advanced to it by allowing themselves to speak untruths in jest and banter_ or under pretence of doing good. Thus men teach their tongues to speak lies_ Jer. ix,20250223
The sluggard has now_ with much ado_ got out of his bed_ but he might as well have lain there still for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work_ so awkwardly does he go about it. Observe_,20250223
The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those whom God troubles with his frowns; for if he_ in displeasure_ hide his face_ and withhold the comfort of his favour_ who then can behold him? that is_ Who can behold a displeased God_ so as to bear up under his wrath or turn it away? Who can make him show his face when he resolves to hide it_ or see through the clouds and darkness which are round about him? Or_ Who can behold a disquieted sinner_ so as to give him effectual relief? Who can stand a friend to him to whom God is an enemy? None can relieve the distresses of the outward condition without God. If the Lord do not help thee_ whence shall I? 2 Kings vi,20250223
The song concludes with an interchanging of parting requests. Christ charges his spouse that she should often let him hear from her (ver. and she begs of him that he would hasten his return to her_ ver. 14).,20250223
The sorrow of the world thus works darkness and death. He grieved so much that he had fretted all the flesh away and become a perfect skeleton_ nothing but skin and bones: __All my members are as a shadow. I have become so poor and thin that I am not to be called a man_ but the shadow of a man.__,20250223
The sorrows of life prevented and anticipated the supports of life; nay_ they took away his appetite for his necessary food. His griefs returned as duly as his meals_ and affliction was his daily bread. Nay_ so great was the extremity of his pain and anguish that he did not only sigh_ but roar_ and his roarings were poured out like the waters in a full and constant stream. Our Master was acquainted with grief_ and we must expect to be so too. ,20250223
The sorrows of the mind often contribute very much to the sickliness of the body: A broken spirit_ sunk by the burden of afflictions_ and especially a conscience wounded with the sense of guilt and fear of wrath_ dries the bones_ wastes the radical moisture_ exhausts the very marrow_ and makes the body a mere skeleton. We should therefore watch and pray against all melancholy dispositions_ for they lead us into trouble as well as into temptation.,20250223
The soul is the life_ the soul is the man_ and this is the gift of God: Thou hast granted me life_ breathed into me the breath of life_ without which the body would be but a worthless carcase. God is the Father of spirits: he made us living souls_ and endued us with the power of reason; he gave us life and favour_ and life is a favour—a great favour_ more than meat_ more than raiment—a distinguishing favour_ a favour that puts us into a capacity of receiving other favours. Now Job was in a better mind than he was when he quarrelled with life as a burden_ and asked_ Why died I not from the womb? Or by life and favour may be meant life and all the comforts of life_ referring to his former prosperity. Time was when he walked in the light of the divine favour_ and thought_ as David_ that through that favour his mountain stood strong.,20250223
The special care God takes to preserve knowledge_ that is_ to keep up religion in the world by keeping up among men the knowledge of himself and of good and evil_ notwithstanding the corruption of mankind_ and the artifices of Satan to blind men's minds and keep them in ignorance. It is a wonderful instance of the power and goodness of the eyes of the Lord_ that is_ his watchful providence. He preserves men of knowledge_ wise and good men (2 Chron. xvi. particularly faithful witnesses_ who speak what they know; God protects such_ and prospers their counsels. He does by his grace preserve knowledge in such_ secures his own work and interest in them. See Prov. ii. 7_ 8,20250223
The spider_ an insect_ but as great an instance of industry in our houses as the ants are in the field. Spiders are very ingenious in weaving their webs with a fineness and exactness such as no art can pretend to come near: They take hold with their hands_ and spin a fine thread out of their own bowels_ with a great deal of art; and they are not only in poor men's cottages_ but in kings' palaces_ notwithstanding all the care that is there taken to destroy them. Providence wonderfully keeps up those kinds of creatures_ not only which men provide not for_ but which every man's hand is against and seeks the destruction of. Those that will mind their business_ and take hold of it with their hands_ shall be in kings' palaces; sooner or later_ they will get preferment_ and may go on with it_ notwithstanding the difficulties and discouragements they meet with. If one well-spun web be swept away_ it is but making another.,20250223
The splendour of his chariot_ v. 9_ 10. As Christ and believers rest in safety under a sufficient guard_ so when they appear publicly_ as kings in their coaches of state_ they appear in great magnificence. This chariot was of Solomon's own contriving and making_ the materials very rich_ silver_ and gold_ and cedar_ and purple. He made it for himself_ and yet made it for the daughters of Jerusalem_ to oblige them. Some by this chariot_ or coach_ or chaise (the word is nowhere else used in scripture)_ understand the human nature of Christ_ in which the divine nature rode as in an open chariot. It was a divine workmanship (A body hast thou prepared me); the structure was very fine_ but that which was at the bottom of it was love_ pure love to the children of men. Others make it to represent the everlasting gospel_ in which_ as in an open chariot_ Christ shows himself_ and as in a chariot of war rides forth triumphantly_ conquering and to conquer. The pillars_ the seven pillars (Prov. ix. 1)_ are of silver_ for the words of the Lord are as silver tried (Ps. xii. nay_ they are better than thousands of gold and silver. It is hung with purple_ a princely colour; all the adornings of it are dyed in the precious blood of Christ_ and that gives them this colour. But that which completes the glory of it is love; it is paved with love_ it is lined with love_ not love of strangers_ as Solomon's was in the days of his defection_ but love of the daughters of Jerusalem_ a holy love. Silver is better than cedar_ gold than silver_ but love is better than gold_ better than all_ and it is put last_ for nothing can be better than that. The gospel is all love. Mr. Durham applies it to the covenant of redemption_ the way of our salvation_ as it is contrived in the eternal counsel of God_ and manifested to us in the scriptures. This is that work of Christ himself wherein the glory of his grace and love to sinners most eminently appears_ and which makes him amiable and admirable in the eyes of believers. In this covenant love is conveyed to them_ and they are carried in it to the perfection of love_ and_ as it were_ ride in triumph. It is admirably framed and contrived_ both for the glory of Christ and for the comfort of believers. It is well ordered in all things_ and sure (2 Sam. xxiii. 5); it has pillars that cannot be shaken_ it is made of the wood of Lebanon_ which can never rot; the basis of it is gold_ the most lasting metal; the blood of the covenant_ that rich purple_ is the cover of this chariot_ by which believers are sheltered from the wind and storms of divine wrath_ and the troubles of this world; but the midst of it_ and that which is all in all in it_ is love_ that love of Christ which surpasses knowledge and the dimensions of which are immeasurable.,20250223
The spoilers shall be spoiled (Isa. xxxiii. 1)_ and those that led captive shall go captive_ Rev. xiii,20250223
The spouse continues her importunity for a more intimate communion and fellowship with him_ ver. 1-3.,20250223
The spouse had described him_ and shown them his excellencies and perfections; and therefore_ though they have not seen him_ yet_ believing_ they love him. Those that undervalue Christ do so because they do not know him; when God_ by his word and Spirit_ discovers him to the soul_ with that ray of light the fire of love to him will be kindled,20250223
The spouse had expressed her own love to him_ her rest in that love_ and triumphed in it: This is my beloved; and that flame in her breast scattered sparks into theirs. As sinful lusts_ when they break out_ defile many_ so the pious zeal of some may provoke many_ 2 Cor. ix 3. The spouse had bespoken their help in seeking her beloved (ch. v. 8); but now they beg hers_ for they perceive that now the cloud she had been under began to scatter_ and the sky to clear up_ and_ while she was describing her beloved to them_ she herself retrieved her comfort in him. Drooping Christians would find benefit themselves by talking of Christ_ as well as do good to others. Now here_ ,20250223
The spouse is much admired by those about her. It comes in in a parenthesis_ but in it gospel-grace lies as plain_ and as much above ground_ as any where in this mystical song: Who is this that comes up from the wilderness_ leaning upon her beloved? Some make these the words of the bridegroom_ expressing himself well pleased with her reliance on him and resignation of herself to his guidance. They are rather the words of the daughters of Jerusalem_ to whom she spoke (v.,20250223
The spouse wishes for a constant intimacy and freedom with the Lord Jesus. She was already betrothed to him_ but_ the nuptials being yet not solemnized and published (the bride_ the Lamb's wife_ will not be completely ready till his second coming)_ she was obliged to be shy and to keep at some distance; she therefore wishes she may be taken for his sister_ he having called her so (ch. v. 1)_ and that she might have the same chaste and innocent familiarity with him that a sister has with a brother_ an own brother_ that sucked the breasts of the same mother with her_ who would therefore be exceedingly tender of her_ as Joseph was of his brother Benjamin. Some make this to be the prayer of the Old-Testament saints for the hastening of Christ's incarnation_ that the church might be the better acquainted with him_ when_ forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh and blood_ he should also himself likewise take part of the same_ and not be ashamed to call them brethren. It is rather the wish of all believers for a more intimate communion with him_ that they might receive the Spirit of sanctification_ and so Christ must be as their brother_ that is_ that they might be as his brethren_ which then they are when by grace they are made partakers of a divine nature_ and he that sanctifies_ and those that are sanctified_ are both of one_ Heb. ii. 11_ &c. It becomes brethren and sisters_ the children of the same parents_ that have been nursed at the same breast_ to be very loving to and tender of one another; such a love the spouse desires might be between her and her beloved_ that she might call him brother,20250223
The spouse_ in this dramatic poem_ is here first introduced addressing herself to the bridegroom and then to the daughters of Jerusalem.,20250223
The spouse_ the church_ expresses her great delight in him_ and the desire that she had of communion and fellowship with him_ ver. 10-13. Such mutual esteem and endearment are there between Christ and believers. And what is heaven but an everlasting interchanging of loves between the holy God and holy souls!,20250223
The stage is clear_ for Job and his three friends have sat down_ and neither he nor they have any thing more to say; it is therefore very seasonable for a moderator to interpose_ and Elihu is the man. In this chapter we have_,20250223
The still-born child's infelicity is only negative (ver. 4_ but that of the covetous worldling is positive; he lives a great while to see himself miserable_ ver. 6,20250223
The strain of this chapter is very unlike the rest of this book. Job forgets his sores_ and all his sorrows_ and talks like a philosopher or a virtuoso. Here is a great deal both of natural and moral philosophy in this discourse; but the question is_ How does it come in here? Doubtless it was not merely for an amusement_ or diversion from the controversy; though_ if it had been only so_ perhaps it would not have been much amiss. When disputes grow hot_ better lose the question than lose our temper. But this is pertinent and to the business in hand. Job and his friends had been discoursing about the dispensations of Providence towards the wicked and the righteous. Job had shown that some wicked men live and die in prosperity_ while others are presently and openly arrested by the judgments of God. But_ if any ask the reason why some are punished in this world and not others_ they must be told it is a question that cannot be answered. The knowledge of the reasons of state in God's government of the world is kept from us_ and we must neither pretend to it nor reach after it. Zophar had wished that God would show Job the __secrets of wisdom__ (ch. xi. 6). No_ says Job_ __secret things belong not to us_ but things revealed___ Deut. xxix,20250223
The streams of being_ power_ and perfection should lead us to the fountain. God is great_ infinitely so_—great in power_ for he is omnipotent and independent_—great in wealth_ for he is self-sufficient and all-sufficient_—great in himself_—great in all his works_—great_ and therefore greatly to be praised_—great_ and therefore we know him not. We know that he is_ but not what he is. We know what he is not_ but not what he is. We know in part_ but not in perfection. This comes in here as a reason why we must not arraign his proceedings_ nor find fault with what he does_ because it is speaking evil of the things that we understand not and answering a matter before we hear if. We know not the duration of his existence_ for it is infinite. The number of his years cannot possibly be searched out_ for he is eternal; there is no number of them. He is a Being without beginning_ succession_ or period_ whoever was_ and ever will be_ and ever the same_ the great I AM. This is a good reason why we should not prescribe to him_ nor quarrel with him_ because_ as he is_ such are his operations_ quite out of our reach.,20250223
The strictness of his scrutiny and enquiries concerning them (v. 9) __Is it good that he should search you out? Can you bear to have the principles looked into which you go upon in your censures_ and to have the bottom of the matter found out?__ Note_ It concerns us all seriously to consider whether it will be to our advantage or no that God searches the heart. It is good to an upright man who means honestly that God should search him; therefore he prays for it: Search me_ O God! and know my heart. God's omniscience is a witness of his sincerity. But it is bad to him who looks one way and rows another that God should search him out_ and lay him open to his confusion. ,20250223
The strong aversion he has to do good: His neighbour_ his friend_ his nearest relation_ finds no favour in his eyes_ cannot gain from him the least kindness_ though he be in the greatest need of it. And_ when he is in the pursuit of the evil his heart is so much upon_ he will spare no man that stands in his way; his next neighbour shall be used no better than a stranger_ than an enemy.,20250223
The sun also ariseth_ and the sun goeth down_ and hasteth to his place where he arose. 6 The wind goeth toward the south_ and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually_ and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. 7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come_ thither they return again. 8 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing_ nor the ear filled with hearing.,20250223
The sunbeams are darted forth_ and reach to cover even the bottom of the sea_ thence to exhale a fresh supply of vapours_ and so raise recruits for the clouds_ v,20250223
The temptation which the oppressed feel to discontent and impatience_ ver. 1-3.,20250223
The temptation which those that love their case feel to take their case and neglect business_ for fear of being envied_ ver. 4-6.,20250223
The temptations of their condition. Being thus hardly used_ they are tempted to hate and despise life_ and to envy those that are dead and in their graves_ and to wish they had never been born (v. 2_ 3); and Solomon is ready to agree with them_ for it serves to prove that all is vanity and vexation_ since life itself is often so; and if we disregard it_ in comparison with the favour and fruition of God (as St. Paul_ Acts xx. 24_ Phil. i. it is our praise_ but_ if (as here) only for the sake of the miseries that attend it_ it is our infirmity_ and we judge therein after the flesh_ as Job and Elijah did. 1. He here thinks those happy who have ended this miserable life_ have done their part and quitted the stage; __I praised the dead that are already dead_ slain outright_ or that had a speedy passage through the world_ made a short cut over the ocean of life_ dead already_ before they had well begun to live; I was pleased with their lot_ and_ had it been in their own choice_ should have praised their wisdom for but looking into the world and then retiring_ as not liking it. I concluded that it is better with them than with the living that are yet alive and that is all_ dragging the long and heavy chain of life_ and wearing out its tedious minutes.__ This may be compared not with Job,20250223
The terror of his majesty_ which if they would duly stand in awe of they would not do that which would make them obnoxious to his wrath (v. 11): __Shall not his excellency make you afraid? You that have great knowledge of God_ and profess religion and a fear of him_ how dare you talk at this rate and give yourselves so great a liberty of speech? Ought you not to walk and talk in the fear of God? Neh. v,20250223
The terrors of conscience: It is bitter as wormwood_,20250223
The testimony of our consciences will be for us_ or against us_ according as we have or have not governed our tongues well. According as the fruit of the mouth is good or bad_ unto iniquity or unto righteousness_ so the character of the man is_ and consequently the testimony of his conscience concerning him. __We ought to take as great care about the words we speak as we do about the fruit of our trees or the increase of the earth_ which we are to eat; for_ according as they are wholesome or unwholesome_ so will the pleasure or the pain be wherewith we shall be filled.__ So bishop Patrick.,20250223
The things of this world are things that are not. They have a real existence in nature and are the real gifts of Providence_ but in the kingdom of grace they are things that are not; they are not a happiness and portion for a soul_ are not what they promise to be nor what we expect them to be; they are a show_ a shadow_ a sham upon the soul that trusts to them. They are not_ for in a little while they will not be_ they will not be ours; they perish in the using; the fashion of them passes away. ,20250223
The things revealed are worthy to be known_ well worthy of all acceptation. We are concerned to hear; for,20250223
The thoughts and words of the pure_ being pure like themselves_ clean_ honest_ and sincere_ are pleasant words and pleasant thoughts_ well-pleasing to the holy God_ who delights in purity. It may be understood both of their devotions to God (the words of their mouth and the meditations of their heart_ in prayer and praise_ are acceptable to God_ Ps. xix. 14; lxix. 13) and of their discourses with men_ tending to edification. Both are pleasant when they come from a pure_ a purified_ heart.,20250223
The thoughts and words of the wicked_ which are_ like themselves_ wicked_ which aim at mischief_ and have some ill tendency or other_ are an abomination to the Lord; he is displeased at them and will reckon for them. The thoughts of wicked men_ for the most part_ are such as God hates_ and are an offence to him_ who not only knows the heart and all that passes and repasses there_ but requires the innermost and uppermost place in it,20250223
The threatening itself: They shall not go unpunished; they shall not escape. This intimates that that which emboldens them in the sin is the hope of impunity_ it being a sin which commonly escapes punishment from men_ though the law is strict_ Deut. xix. 18_ 19. But it shall not escape the righteous judgment of God_ who is jealous_ and will not suffer his name to be profaned; we know where all liars will have their everlasting portion.,20250223
The time of singing of birds has come. The little birds_ which all the winter lie hid in their retirements and scarcely live_ when the spring returns forget all the calamities of the winter_ and to the best of their capacity chant forth the praises of their Creator. Doubtless he who understands the birds that cry for want (Ps. cxlvii. 9) takes notice of those that sing for joy Ps. civ,20250223
The title of the book_ showing the general scope and design of it_ ver. 1-6.,20250223
The title which Jesus Christ here gives to the church is new: O prince's daughter! agreeing with Ps. xlv. 13_ where she is called the king's daughter. She is so in respect of her new birth_ born from above_ begotten of God_ and his workmanship_ bearing the image of the King of kings_ and guided by his Spirit. She is so by marriage; Christ_ by betrothing her to himself_ though he found her mean and despicable_ has made her a prince's daughter. She has a princely disposition_ something in her truly noble and generous; she is daughter and heir to the prince of the kings of the earth. If children_ then heirs. Now here we have_,20250223
The tongue also grows unruly and talks extravagantly; by it the heart utters perverse things_ things contrary to reason_ religion_ and common civility_ which they would be ashamed to speak if they were sober. What ridiculous incoherent nonsense men will talk when they are drunk who at another time will speak admirably well and to the purpose!,20250223
The tongue is death or life_ poison or medicine_ as it is used. 1. There are words that are cutting and killing_ that are like the piercings of a sword. Opprobrious words grieve the spirits of those to whom they are spoken_ and cut them to the heart. Slanders_ like a sword_ wound the reputation of those of whom they are uttered_ and perhaps incurably. Whisperings and evil surmises_ like a sword_ divide and cut asunder the bounds of love and friendship_ and separate those that have been dearest to each other,20250223
The tongue of the crafty speaks with design and deliberation; and therefore those that use it may be said to choose it_ as that which will serve their purpose better than the tongue of the upright: but it will be found_ at last_ that honesty is the best policy. Eliphaz_ in his first discourse_ had proceeded against Job upon mere surmise (ch. iv. 6_ but now he has got proof against him from his own discourses (v. 6): Thy own mouth condemns thee_ and not,20250223
The torments of hell. If some that have been guilty of this sin have repented and been saved_ yet the direct tendency of the sin is to destruction of body and soul; the feet of it go down to death_ nay_ they take hold on hell_ to pull it to the sinner_ as if the damnations slumbered too long_ v,20250223
The treasures of wicked people_ much more the treasure which they have made themselves masters of by any wicked people_ by oppression of fraud_ though it be ever so much_ as a treasure_ and laid up ever so safely_ though it be hidden treasure_ yet it profits nothing; when profit and loss come to be balanced the profit gained by the treasures will by no means countervail the loss sustained by the wickedness_ Matt. xvi,20250223
The tree is known by its fruits_ a man by his doings_ even a young tree by its first fruits_ a child by his childish things_ whether his work be clean only_ appearing good (the word is used ch. xvi.,20250223
The trial Solomon made of these_ ver. 12_ 13_ 16_ 17,20250223
The troops of Tema and Sheba_ the caravans of the merchants of those countries_ whose road lay through the deserts of Arabia_ looked and waited for supply of water from those brooks. __Hard by here___ says one_ __A little further___ says another_ __when I last travelled this way_ there was water enough; we shall have that to refresh us.__ Where we have met with relief or comfort we are apt to expect it again; and yet it does not follow; for_ ,20250223
The truth received a great deal of light from the dispute between Job and his friends concerning those points about which they differed; but now they are upon a subject in which they were all agreed_ the infinite glory and power of God. How does truth triumph_ and how brightly does it shine_ when there appears no other strife between the contenders than which shall speak most highly and honourably of God and be most copious in showing forth his praise! It were well if all disputes about matters of religion might end thus_ in glorifying God as Lord of all_ and our Lord_ with one mind and one mouth (Rom. xv. 6); for to that we have all attained_ in that we are all agreed.,20250223
The unbelief of man shall not make God's threatenings of no effect; those that devour iniquity swallow the hook with the bait. The civil magistrate has judgments prepared for scorners_ for otherwise he would bear the sword in vain; but if he be remiss_ and connive at sin_ yet God's judgments slumber not; they are prepared_ Matt. xxv. 41.,20250223
The uncertainty of worldly wealth (v. 24): Riches are not for ever. ,20250223
The understanding_ the intentions of a believer_ are clean and clear as these ponds. The eyes_ weeping for sin_ are as fountains (Jer. ix. 1)_ and comely with Christ,20250223
The unicorn—rhem_ a strong creature (Num. xxiii. a stately proud creature_ Ps. cxii.,20250223
The unspeakable worth of such a one_ and the value which he that has such a wife ought to put upon her_ showing it by his thankfulness to God and his kindness and respect to her_ whom he must never think he can do too much for. Her price is far above rubies_ and all the rich ornaments with which vain women adorn themselves. The more rare such good wives are the more they are to be valued.,20250223
The uprightness_ the reformation_ that should be_ in order to life and peace. When men are made to see the way of uprightness to be the only way_ and a sure way to salvation_ and to choose it_ and walk in it accordingly_ the work is done. I God's gracious acceptance of him_ upon his repentance_ v,20250223
The use Job makes of all this. 1. He pleads it with God_ who_ he thought_ was too strict and severe with him (ver. 16_ begging that_ in consideration of his frailty_ he would not contend with him (ver. but grant him some respite_ ver. 6,20250223
The use and application of all this. Will the prosperity of presumptuous sinners end thus miserably? Then (v. 31) let not him that is deceived trust in vanity. Let the mischiefs which befal others be our warnings_ and let not us rest on that broken reed which always failed those who leaned on it. ,20250223
The use that is to be made of this description. We have taken a view of this mountain of a beast_ this over-grown animal_ which is here set before us_ not merely as a show (as sometimes it is in our country) to satisfy our curiosity and to amuse us_ but as an argument with us to humble ourselves before the great God; for,20250223
The vanity of human life; so uncertain a good is it that it often proves men's greatest burden and nothing is so desirable as to get clear of it. Let grace make us willing to part with it whenever God calls; for it may so happen that even sense may make us desirous to part with it before he calls.,20250223
The vanity of worldly honour and power_ which are abused for the support of oppression and persecution if men be not governed by the fear of God in the use of them_ ver,20250223
The various arts of deceiving that men have_ all which evils the love of money is the root of. In paying and receiving money_ which was then commonly done by the scale_ they had divers weights_ an under-weight for what they paid and an over-weight for what they received; in delivering out and taking in goods they had divers measures_ a scanty measure to sell by and a large measure to buy by. This was done wrong with plot and contrivance_ and under colour of doing right. Under these is included all manner of fraud and deceit in commerce and trade,20250223
The vast importance of it: This is the whole of man; it is all his business and all his blessedness; our whole duty is summed up in this and our whole comfort is bound up in this. It is the concern of every man_ and ought to be his chief and continual care; it is the common concern of all men_ of their whole time. It is nothing to a man whether he be rich or poor_ high or low_ but it is the main matter_ it is all in all to a man_ to fear God and do as he bids him.,20250223
The view which Solomon took of the field and vineyard of the slothful man. He did not go on purpose to see it_ but_ as he passed by_ observing the fruitfulness of the ground_ as it is very proper for travellers to do_ and his subjects' management of their land_ as it is very proper for magistrates to do_ he cast his eye upon a field and a vineyard unlike all the rest; for_ though the soil was good_ yet there was nothing growing in them but thorns and nettles_ not here and there one_ but they were all overrun with weeds; and_ if there had been any fruit_ it would have been eaten up by the beasts_ for there was no fence: The stone-wall was broken down See the effects of that curse upon the ground (Gen. iii.,20250223
The virtues of a good king. Those are mercy and truth_ especially mercy_ for that is mentioned twice here. He must be strictly faithful to his word_ must be sincere_ and abhor all dissimulation_ must religiously discharge all the trusts reposed in him_ must support and countenance truth. He must likewise rule with clemency_ and by all acts of compassion gain the affections of his people. Mercy and truth are the glories of God's throne_ and kings are called gods.,20250223
The voice of the turtle is heard in our land_ which is one of the season-birds mentioned Jer. viii. 7_ that observe the time of their coming and the time of their singing_ and so shame us who know not the judgment of the Lord_ understand not the times_ nor do that which is beautiful in its season_ do not sing in singing time. ,20250223
The way of duty is safe and easy: He that keeps his soul_ that watches carefully over his own heart and ways_ is far from those thorns and snares_ for his way is both plain and pleasant.,20250223
The way of religion is here recommended to us,20250223
The way of righteousness is light (v. 18): The path of the just_ which they have chosen_ and in which they walk_ is as light; the light shines on their ways (Job xxii. 28) and makes them both safe and pleasant. Christ is their way and he is the light. They are guided by the word of God and that is a light to their feet; they themselves are light in the Lord and they walk in the light as he is in the light. ,20250223
The way of sin is as darkness_ v,20250223
The way of wisdom and holiness is here recommended to us,20250223
The way to be beloved is to be lovely.—Ovid.,20250223
The way to be poor. Those that are hasty_ that are rash and inconsiderate in their affairs_ and will not take time to think_ that are greedy of gain_ by right or wrong_ and make haste to be rich by unjust practices or unwise projects_ are in the ready road to poverty. Their thoughts and contrivances_ by which they hope to raise themselves_ will ruin them.,20250223
The way to be rich. If we would live plentifully and comfortably in the world_ we must be diligent in our business_ and not shrink from the toil and trouble of it_ but prosecute it closely_ improving all advantages and opportunities for it_ and doing what we do with all our might; yet we must not be hasty in it_ nor hurry ourselves and others with it_ but keep doing fair and softly_ which_ we say_ goes far in a day. With diligence there must be contrivance. The thoughts of the diligent are as necessary as the hand of the diligent. Forecast is as good as work. Seest thou a man thus prudent and diligent? He will have enough to live on,20250223
The way to have a good night is to keep a good conscience; and the sleep_ as of the labouring man_ so of the wise and godly man_ is sweet. ,20250223
The way to know the certainty of the words of truth is to make conscience of our duty; for_ if any man do his will_ he shall know for certain that the doctrine is of God_ John vii,20250223
The way to preserve peace among relations and neighbours is to make the best of every thing_ not to tell others what has been said or done against them when it is not at all necessary to their safety_ nor to take notice of what has been said or done against them when it is not at all necessary to their safety_ nor to take notice of what has been said or done against ourselves_ but to excuse both_ and put the best construction upon them. __It was an oversight; therefore overlook it. It was done through forgetfulness; therefore forget it. It perhaps made nothing of you; do you make nothing of it.__ 2. The ripping up of faults is the ripping out of love_ and nothing tends more to the separating of friends_ and setting them at variance_ than the repeating of matters that have been in variance; for they commonly lose nothing in the repetition_ but the things themselves are aggravated and the passions about them revived and exasperated. The best method of peace is by an amnesty or act of oblivion.,20250223
The ways of wickedness are dangerous and destructive: The wicked shall fail into misery and ruin by their own wickedness_ and be taken in their own naughtiness as in a snare. O Israel! thou hast destroyed thyself. Their sin will be their punishment; that very thing by which they contrived to shelter themselves will make against them.,20250223
The wealth that is hidden in the earth cannot be obtained but with a great deal of difficulty.,20250223
The whole matter summed up and concluded_ with a charge to all to be truly religious_ in consideration of the judgment to come_ ver. 13_ 14.,20250223
The wicked are oftentimes impoverished and brought low_ so that they are forced to beg_ their wickedness having reduced them to straits; while good men_ by the blessing of God_ are enriched_ and enabled to give_ and do give_ even to the evil; for where God grants life we must not deny a livelihood,20250223
The wicked entangling themselves in trouble by their folly_ when God in justice leaves them to themselves. They are often snared by the transgression of their lips and their throats are cut with their own tongues. By speaking evil of dignities they expose themselves to public justice; by giving ill language they become obnoxious to private resentments_ are sued for defamation_ and actions on the case for words are brought against them. Many a man has paid dearly in this world for the transgression of his lips_ and has felt the lash on his back for want of a bridle upon his tongue_ Ps. lxiv. 8,20250223
The wicked has a house_ a strong and stately dwelling perhaps_ but the curse of the Lord is upon it_ it is in it_ and_ though the affairs of the family may prosper_ yet the very blessings are curses_ Mal. ii,20250223
The wicked have fallen into the distresses which they thought themselves far from_ nay_ which they had been instrumental to bring the righteous into_ so that they seem to come in their stead_ as a ransom for the just. Mordecai is saved from the gallows_ Daniel from the lion's den_ and Peter from the prison; and their persecutors come in their stead. The Israelites are delivered out of the Red Sea and the Egyptians drowned in it. So precious are the saints in God's eye that he gives men for them_ Isa. xliii. 3_ 4.,20250223
The wicked make a great noise_ hurry themselves and others_ like a whirlwind_ which threatens to bear down all before it; but_ like a whirlwind_ they are presently gone_ and they pass irrecoverably; they are no more; all about them are quiet and glad when the storm is over_ Ps.,20250223
The wicked man pretends that_ though he does not talk of religion as the just do_ yet he has it within him_ and thanks God that his heart is good; but he that searches the heart here says the contrary: It is nothing worth,20250223
The wicked man swears_ has no veneration for the name of God_ but profanes it by swearing rashly and falsely; but the righteous man fears an oath_ swears not_ but is sworn_ and then with great reverence; he fears to take an oath_ because it is a solemn appeal to God as a witness and judge; he fears_ when he has taken a oath_ to break it_ because God is righteous who takes vengeance.,20250223
The wicked man's days are as a shadow_ not only uncertain and declining_ as all men's days are_ but altogether unprofitable. A good man's days have some substance in them; he lives to a good purpose. A wicked man's days are all as a shadow_ empty and worthless. ,20250223
The wicked man_ who expected to see his ruin and to help it forward_ is undone. He falls into mischief; his sins and his troubles are his utter destruction.,20250223
The wicked may have some light for a while_ some pleasure_ some joy_ some hope within_ as well as wealth_ and honour_ and power without. But his light is but a spark (v. a little thing and soon extinguished. It is but a candle (v. wasting_ and burning down_ and easily blown out. It is not the light of the Lord (that is sun-light)_ but the light of his own fire and sparks of his own kindling_ Isa. l. 11,20250223
The wicked one shall be consumed with the breath of his mouth_ 2 Thess. ii,20250223
The wicked would have wrath; they desire the woeful day_ that God's judgments may gratify their passion and revenge_ may remove those that stand in their way_ and that they may make an advantage to themselves by fishing in troubled waters; and wrath they shall have_ so shall their doom be. They expect and desire mischief to others_ but it shall return upon themselves; as they loved cursing_ they shall have enough of it.,20250223
The wickedness they thought to establish in their families shall be broken as a tree; all their wicked projects shall be blasted_ and all their wicked hopes dashed and buried with them,20250223
The widows that were sighing for grief_ and trembling for fear_ he made to sing for joy_ so carefully did he protect them and provide for them_ and so heartily did he espouse their interest. It is a pleasure to a good man_ and should be so to a great man_ to give those occasion to rejoice that are most acquainted with grief. ,20250223
The wild ass_ a creature we frequently read of in Scripture_ some say untameable. Man is said to be born as the wild ass's colt_ so hard to be governed. Two things Providence has allotted to the wild ass:—1. An unbounded liberty (v. 5): Who but God has sent out the wild ass free? He has given a disposition to it_ and therefore a dispensation for it. The tame ass is bound to labour; the wild ass has no bonds on him. Note_ Freedom from service_ and liberty to range at pleasure_ are but the privileges of a wild ass. It is a pity that any of the children of men should covet such a liberty_ or value themselves on it. It is better to labour and be good for something than ramble and be good for nothing. But if_ among men_ Providence sets some at liberty and suffers them to live at ease_ while others are doomed to servitude_ we must not marvel at the matter: it is so among the brute-creatures,20250223
The will of God revealed to us for our salvation is here largely represented to us as easy to be known and understood_ that none may have an excuse for their ignorance or error_ and as worthy to be embraced_ that none may have an excuse for their carelessness and unbelief.,20250223
The wings they fly away upon are of their own making. They have in themselves the principles of their own corruption_ their own moth and rust. They are wasting in their own nature_ and like a handful of dust_ which_ if it be grasped_ slips through the fingers. Snow will last awhile_ and look pretty_ if it be left to lie on the ground where it fell_ but_ if gathered up and laid in the bosom_ it is dissolved and gone immediately. ,20250223
The winter is past_ the dark_ cold_ and barren winter. Long winters and hard ones pass away at last; they do no endure always. And the spring would not be so pleasant as it is if it did not succeed the winter_ which is a foil to its beauty_ Eccl. vii,20250223
The wisdom of the Creator has placed these things,20250223
The wisdom of those that are willing_ not only to be taught_ but to be reproved: He that hears reproof_ and amends the faults he is reproved for_ gets understanding_ by which his soul is secured from bad ways and directed in good ways_ and thereby he both evidences the value he has for his own soul and puts true honour upon it.,20250223
The wise and foolish_ cowards and the brave_,20250223
The wise and penitent preacher is here closing his sermon; and he closes it_ not only lie a good orator_ but like a good preacher_ with that which was likely to make the best impressions and which he wished might be powerful and lasting upon his hearers. Here is_,20250223
The wise are something more; they are as trees of knowledge_ not forbidden_ but commanded knowledge. He that is wise_ by communicating his wisdom_ wins souls_ wins upon them to bring them in love with God and holiness_ and so wins them over into the interests of God's kingdom among men. The wise are said to turn many to righteousness_ and that is the same with winning souls here_ Dan. xii,20250223
The witness in our own bosoms for us will stand us in little stead if we have not a witness in heaven for us too; for God is greater than our hearts_ and we are not to he our own judges. This therefore is Job's triumph_ My witness is in heaven. Note_ It is an unspeakable comfort to a good man_ when he lies under the censure of his brethren_ that there is a God in heaven who knows his integrity and will clear it up sooner or later. See John v. 31_ 37. This one witness is instead of a thousand.,20250223
The wonderful complacency which the spouse takes in the honour which the king put upon her. Being brought into the chamber_ ,20250223
The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions_ if we would but enter into discourse with it_ would ask it what it has to say_ and give it the hearing. And it would contribute to our close and comfortable walking with God all day if we would begin with him in the morning and let his word be the subject of our first thoughts. When I awake I am still with thee; we are so if the word be still with us. ,20250223
The word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart_ and judges them. We mistake if we imagine that thoughts are free. No_ they are under the divine cognizance_ and therefore under the divine command,20250223
The word of God is intended_ and therefore so is the ministry of that word_ for reproof_ for correction_ and for instruction in righteousness.,20250223
The word of God is two-fold_ and_ in both senses_ is wisdom; for a word without wisdom is of little value_ and wisdom without a word is of little use. Now_,20250223
The words of Job justifying himself were ended_ ch. xxxi,20250223
The words of his mouth are all sweet to a believer_ sweet as milk to babes (to whom it is agreeable)_ as honey to those that are grown up (Ps. cxix. 103)_ to whom it is delicious. The kisses of his mouth_ all the tokens of his love_ have a transcendent sweetness in them_ and are most delightful to those who have their spiritual senses exercised. To you that believe he is precious.,20250223
The words of such a man's mouth are as a flowing brook. What he sees cause to speak flows naturally from him and with a great deal of ease_ and freedom_ and natural fluency; it is clean and fresh_ it is cleansing and refreshing; from his deep waters there flows what there is occasion for_ to water those about him_ as the brooks do the low grounds.,20250223
The work of angels is to praise God. The more we abound in holy_ humble_ thankful_ joyful praise_ the more we do the will of God as they do it; and_ whereas we are so barren and defective in praising God_ it is a comfort to think that they are doing it in a better manner. ,20250223
The workers of iniquity would hide themselves if they could from the eye of the world for shame (and that perhaps they may do)_ and from the eye of God for fear_ as Adam among the trees of the garden. The day is coming when mighty men_ and chief captains_ will call to the rocks and mountains to hide them. ,20250223
The works he had cautioned us not to have fellowship with are works of darkness. What true pleasure and satisfaction can those have who know no pleasure and satisfaction but what they have in doing mischief? What sure guide have those that cast God's word behind them? The way of the wicked is dark_ and therefore dangerous; for they stumble and yet know not at what they stumble. They fall into sin_ but are not aware which way the temptation came by which they were overthrown_ and therefore know not how to avoid it the next time. They fall into trouble_ but never enquire wherefore God contends with them; they consider not that they do evil_ nor what will be in the end of it_ Ps. lxxxii. 5; Job xviii. 5_ 6. This is the way we are directed to shun.,20250223
The works of nature are mysterious; the most curious searches come far short of full discoveries and the wisest philosophers have owned themselves at a loss. The designs of Providence ar much more deep and unaccountable_ Rom. xi,20250223
The works themselves which we see done are vanity and vexation to those that are employed in them. There is so much care in the contrivance of our worldly business_ so much toil in the prosecution of it_ and so much trouble in the disappointments we meet with in it_ that we may well say_ It is vexation of spirit. ,20250223
The world can only be an annuity for life_ not a portion for ever. ,20250223
The worst reproach is that which follows wickedness and an opposition to that which is good: He that is of a perverse heart_ that turns aside to crooked ways_ and goes on frowardly in them_ shall be despised. Providence will bring him to poverty and contempt_ and all that have a true sense of honour will despise him as unworthy to be dealt with and unfit to be trusted_ as a blemish and scandal to mankind.,20250223
The worth and weight of the things themselves which Solomon in this book gives us the knowledge of. They are not trivial things_ for amusements and diversion_ not jocular proverbs_ to be repeated in sport and in order to pass away time. No; they are excellent things_ which concern the glory of God_ the holiness and happiness of our souls_ the welfare of mankind and all communities; they are princely things (so the word is)_ fit for kings to speak and senates to hear; they are things that concern counsels and knowledge_ that is_ wise counsels_ relating to the most important concerns; things which will not only make us knowing ourselves_ but enable us to advise others.,20250223
The wrath and curse of God light and lie_ not only upon his head and heart_ but upon his house too_ to consume it with the timber and stones thereof_ Zech. v,20250223
The wrath of God_ scattered among the proud_ will humble them_ and break them_ and bring them down. If he casts abroad the rage of his wrath_ as he will do at the great day and sometimes does in this life_ the stoutest heart cannot hold out against him. Who knows the power of his anger? ,20250223
The wrath of a king may sometimes be like the roaring of a lion_ but can never pretend to imitate God's thunder.,20250223
The young were not fit for labour_ they were so lazy_ and went about their work so awkwardly: Whereto might the strength of their hands profit me? The old were not to be advised with in the smallest matters_ for in them was old age indeed_ but their old age was perished_ they were twice children,20250223
Their bodies from being buried in the dust; I saw them laid in the grave; and their pomp_ though it attended them thither_ could not descend after them_ Ps. xlix. 17.,20250223
Their building was therefore weak and tottering: __You comfort me in vain. All you have said gives me no relief; you tell me that I shall prosper again if I turn to God_ but you go upon this presumption_ that piety shall certainly be crowned with prosperity_ which is false; and therefore how can your inference from it yield me any comfort?__ Note_ Where there is not truth there is little comfort to be expected.,20250223
Their cattle increase_ and they meet with no disappointment in them; not so much as a cow casts her calf_ and then their much must needs grow more. This is promised_ Exod. xxiii. 26; Deut. vii,20250223
Their channel leave to roll in clouds above;,20250223
Their children do not pray_ or say their catechism_ but dance_ and sing_ and rejoice at the sound of the organ. Sensual pleasures are all the delights of carnal people_ and as men are themselves so they breed their children.,20250223
Their comforts were sapless and insipid; so some understand v. 6_ 7. He complains he had nothing now offered to him for his relief that was proper for him_ no cordial_ nothing to revive and cheer his spirits; what they had afforded was in itself as tasteless as the white of an egg_ and_ when applied to him_ as loathsome and burdensome as the most sorrowful meat. I am sorry he should say thus of what Eliphaz had excellently well said_ ch. v. 8_ &c. But peevish spirits are too apt thus to abuse their comforters.,20250223
Their end is really fearful_ and the more so for their mistake: It is the ways of death_ eternal death; their iniquity will certainly be their ruin_ and they will perish with a lie in their right hand. Self-deceivers will prove in the end self-destroyers.,20250223
Their enquiry concerning her beloved: __What is thy beloved more than another beloved? If thou wilt have us to find him for thee_ give us his marks_ that we may know him when we see him.__ ,20250223
Their extent. The claps of thunder roll under the whole heaven_ and are heard far and near; so are the lightnings darted to the ends of the earth; they come out of the one part under heaven and shine to the other_ Luke xvii.,20250223
Their families shall be taken under the special protection of the divine Providence_ and shall prosper as far as is for their good. ,20250223
Their foundation is rotten_ and they went upon a wrong hypothesis: __In your answers there remains falsehood; what you have said stands not only unproved but disproved_ and lies under such an imputation of falsehood as you cannot clear it from.__ ,20250223
Their graces and joys shall be all consummate. Therefore it is our wisdom to keep close to the path of the just.,20250223
Their heads are giddy_ and when they lie down to sleep they are as if they were tossed by the rolling waves of the sea_ or upon the top of a mast; hence they complain that their heads swim; their sleep is commonly unquiet and not refreshing_ and their dreams are tumultuous. ,20250223
Their hope shall be as a puff of breath (margin)_ vanished and gone past recall. Or their hope will perish and expire as a man does when he gives up the ghost; it will fail them when they have most need of it and when they expected the accomplishment of it; it will die away_ and leave them in utter confusion,20250223
Their judgments are clouded_ and they have no more steadiness and consistency than he that sleeps upon the top of a mast: they drink and forget the law (ch. xxxi. 5): they err through wine (Isa. xxviii. and think as extravagantly as they talk. ,20250223
Their life is short_ and in a little time they are cut off. It lasts perhaps but from morning to evening. It is but a day (so some understand it); their birth and death are but the sun-rise and sun-set of the same day. ,20250223
Their not entering upon the following solemn discourses till the seventh day may perhaps intimate that it was the sabbath day_ which doubtless was observed in the patriarchal age_ and to that day they adjourned the intended conference_ because probably then company resorted_ as usual_ to Job's house_ to join with him in his devotions_ who might be edified by the discourse. Or_ rather_ by their silence so long they would intimate that what they afterwards said was well considered and digested and the result of many thoughts. The heart of the wise studies to answer. We should think twice before we speak once_ especially in such a case as this_ think long_ and we shall be the better able to speak short and to the purpose.,20250223
Their order. The lightning is first directed_ and after it a voice roars_ v,20250223
Their original_ not their second causes_ but the first. God directs the thunder_ and the lightning is his_ v,20250223
Their portion in the world may be wealth and preferment_ but their portion with God is ruin and misery. They are above the control of any earthly power_ it may be_ but the Almighty can deal with them.,20250223
Their pretensions are fitly compared to the great show which the brooks make when they are swollen with the waters of a land flood_ by the melting of the ice and snow_ which make them blackish or muddy_ v,20250223
Their pride shall be brought down and laid in the dust (v. 24); and_ in mercy to the world_ they shall be taken out of the way_ and all their power and prosperity shall be cut off. You may seek them_ and they shall not be found. Job owns that wicked people will be miserable at last_ miserable on the other side death_ but utterly denies what his friends asserted_ that ordinarily they are miserable in this life.,20250223
Their production and motion are not from chance_ but from the counsel of God and under the direction and dominion of his providence_ though to us they seem accidental and ungovernable. ,20250223
Their purple channels and defraud the heart_,20250223
Their riches do them hurt_ make them proud_ secure_ and in love with the world_ draw away their hearts from God and duty_ and make it very difficult for them to enter into the kingdom of heaven_ nay_ help to shut them out of it. ,20250223
Their ruin will be inevitable_ and there will be no possibility of escaping it (v. 24): He shall flee from the iron weapon. Flight argues guilt. He will not humble himself under the judgments of God_ nor seek means to make his peace with him. All his care is to escape the vengeance that pursues him_ but in vain: if he escape the sword_ yet the bow of steel shall strike him through. God has weapons of all sorts; he has both whet his sword and bent his bow (Ps. vii. 12_ 13); he can deal with his enemies cominus vel eminus—at hand or afar off. He has a sword for those that think to fight it out with him by their strength_ and a bow for those that think to avoid him by their craft. See Isa. xxiv. 17_ 18; Jer. xlviii. 43_ 44. He that is marked for ruin_ though he may escape one judgment_ will find another ready for him.,20250223
Their trade is to steal_ and to make a prey of all about them. They have chosen it as their trade; it is their work_ because there is more to be got by it_ and it is got more easily_ than by an honest calling. They follow it as their trade; they follow it closely; they go forth to it as their work_ as man goes forth to his labour_ Ps. civ,20250223
Their violence. He will not stay them_ that is_ he does not need to check them_ or hold them back_ lest they should grow unruly and out of his power to restrain them_ but lets them take their course_ says to them_ Go_ and they go—Come_ and they come—Do this_ and they do it. He will not stay the rains and showers that usually follow upon the thunder (which he had spoken of_ ch. xxxvi. 27_ so some_ but will pour them out upon the earth when his voice is heard. Thunder-showers are sweeping rains_ and for them he makes the lightnings_ Ps. cxxxv,20250223
Their waters may exhale and upward move_,20250223
Their wisdom cannot save them from death: They die without wisdom_ die for want of wisdom_ by their own foolish management of themselves_ digging their graves with their own teeth. ,20250223
Then he openeth the ears of men_ and sealeth their instruction_ 17 That he may withdraw man from his purpose_ and hide pride from man. 18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit_ and his life from perishing by the sword.,20250223
Then he showeth them their work_ and their transgressions that they have exceeded. 10 He openeth also their ear to discipline_ and commandeth that they return from iniquity. 11 If they obey and serve him_ they shall spend their days in prosperity_ and their years in pleasures. 12 But if they obey not_ they shall perish by the sword_ and they shall die without knowledge. 13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. 14 They die in youth_ and their life is among the unclean.,20250223
Then he will cry to God_ will pray_ and pray earnestly. Those who in prosperity slighted God_ either prayed not at all or were cold and careless in prayer_ when trouble comes will make their application to him and cry as men in earnest. But_ ,20250223
Then let me sow_ and let another eat; yea_ let my offspring be rooted out.,20250223
Then let my wife grind unto another_ and let others bow down upon her. 11 For this is a heinous crime; yea_ it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. 12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction_ and would root out all mine increase. 13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant_ when they contended with me,20250223
Then shall the silver cord_ by which soul and body were wonderfully fastened together_ be loosed_ that sacred knot untied_ and those old friends be forced to part; then shall the golden bowl_ which held the waters of life for us_ be broken; then shall the pitcher with which we used to fetch up water_ for the constant support of life and the repair of its decays_ be broken_ even at the fountain_ so that it can fetch up no more; and the wheel (all those organs that serve for the collecting and distributing of nourishment) shall be broken_ and disabled to do their office any more. The body shall become like a watch when the spring is broken_ the motion of all the wheels is stopped and they all stand still; the machine is taken to pieces; the heart beats no more_ nor does the blood circulate. Some apply this to the ornaments and utensils of life; rich people must_ at death_ leave behind them their clothing and furniture of silver and gold_ and poor people their earthen pitchers_ and the drawers of water will have their wheel broken. ,20250223
Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord_ and find the knowledge of God. 6 For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. 7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. 8 He keepeth the paths of judgment_ and preserveth the way of his saints. 9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness_ and judgment_ and equity; yea_ every good path.,20250223
Then she lifts up her wings on high (the strength of which then stands her in better stead than their beauty)_ and_ with the help of them_ runs so fast that a horseman at full speed cannot overtake her: She scorneth the horse and his rider. Those that are least under the law of natural affection often contend most for the law of self-preservation. Let not the rider be proud of the swiftness of his horse when such an animal as the ostrich shall out-run him.,20250223
Then the waters that had covered the deep_ and stood above the mountains_ retired with precipitation. At God's rebuke they fled_ Ps. civ. 6_ 7,20250223
Then thou scarest me with dreams_ and terrifiest me through visions: 15 So that my soul chooseth strangling_ and death rather than my life. 16 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.,20250223
Then we must look upon ourselves as upon our probation in it. There is indeed no profit in that wherein we labour; the thing itself_ when we have it_ will do us little good; but_ if we make a right use of the disposals of Providence about it_ there will be profit in that (v. 10): I have seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men_ not to make up a happiness by it_ but to be exercised in it_ to have various graces exercised by the variety of events_ to have their dependence upon God tried by every change_ and to be trained up to it_ and taught both how to want and how to abound_ Phil. iv,20250223
Then we must not expect our portion in it_ for the good things of it are of no certainty_ no continuance (v. 9): What profit has he that works? What can a man promise himself from planting and building_ when that which he thinks is brought to perfection may so soon_ and will so surely_ be plucked up and broken down? All our pains and care will not alter either the mutable nature of the things themselves or the immutable counsel of God concerning them,20250223
Thence he infers how unable he was to contend with the Almighty. None is so fierce_ none so fool-hardy_ that he dares to stir up the leviathan (v. it being known that he will certainly be too hard for them; and who then is able to stand before God_ either to impeach and arraign his proceedings or to out-face the power of his wrath? If the inferior creatures that are put under the feet of man_ and over whom he has dominion_ keep us in awe thus_ how terrible must the majesty of our great Lord be_ who has a sovereign dominion over us and against whom man has been so long in rebellion! Who can stand before him when once he is angry?,20250223
Thence man's maintenance is fetched_ to remind him of his own original; he is of the earth_ and is hastening to the earth. Under it is turned up as it were fire_ precious stones_ that sparkle as fire—brimstone_ that is apt to take fire—coal_ that is proper to feed fire. As we have our food_ so we have our fuel_ out of the earth. There the sapphires and other gems are_ and thence gold-dust is digged up;_ v,20250223
There are creatures so little_ so weak_ as to be easily restrained thus_ and triumphed over; but the leviathan is not one of these: he is made to be the terror_ not the sport and diversion_ of mankind,20250223
There are creatures that are willing to serve man_ that seem to take a pleasure in serving him_ and to have a love for their masters; but there are such as will never be brought to serve him_ which is the effect of sin. Man has revolted from his subjection to his Maker_ and is therefore justly punished with the revolt of the inferior creatures from their subjection to him; and yet_ as an instance of God's good-will to man_ there are some that are still serviceable to him. Though the wild bull (which some think is meant here by the unicorn) will not serve him_ nor submit to his hand in the furrows_ yet there are tame bullocks that will_ and other animals that are not feræ naturæ—of a wild nature_ in whom man may have a property_ for whom he provides_ and to whose service he is entitled. Lord_ what is man_ that thou art thus mindful of him? 2. __Thou darest not trust him; though his strength is great_ yet thou wilt not leave thy labour to him_ as thou dost with thy asses or oxen_ which a little child may lead or drive_ leaving to them all the pains. Thou wilt never depend upon the wild bull_ as likely to come to thy harvest-work_ much less to go through it_ to bring home thy seed and gather it into thy barn___ v. 11_ 12. And_ because he will not serve about the corn_ he is not so well fed as the tame ox_ whose mouth was not to be muzzled in treading out the corn; but therefore he will not draw the plough_ because he that made him never designed him for it. A disposition to labour is as much the gift of God as an ability for it; and it is a great mercy if_ where God gives strength for service_ he gives a heart; it is what we should pray for_ and reason ourselves into_ which the brutes cannot do; for_ as among beasts_ so among men_ those may justly be reckoned wild and abandoned to the deserts who have no mind either to take pains or to do good.,20250223
There are days of darkness coming_ the days of our lying in the grave; there the body will lie in the dark; there the eyes see not_ the sun shines not. The darkness of death is opposed to the light of life; the grave is a land of darkness_ Job x,20250223
There are good reasons for what he does_ though we cannot assign them (v. 23): God understands the way thereof. Men sometimes do they know not what_ but God never does. Men do what they did not design to do; new occurrences put them upon new counsels_ and oblige them to take new measures. But God does all according to the purpose which he purposed in himself_ and which he never alters. Men sometimes do that which they cannot give a good reason for_ but in every will of God there is a counsel: he knows both what he does and why he does it_ the whole series of events and the order and place of every occurrence. This knowledge he has in perfection_ but keeps to himself. Two reasons are here given why God must needs understand his own way_ and he only:—,20250223
There are many that do not know when they are well off_ but are uneasy with their present condition_ and given to change. God_ in his providence_ has appointed them a place fit for them and has made it comfortable to them; but they affect unsettledness; they love to wander; they are glad of a pretence to go abroad_ and do not care for staying long at a place; they needlessly absent themselves from their own work and care_ and meddle with that which belongs not to them.,20250223
There are many timorous trembling Christians_ that are spiritually rich_ and full of grace_ and yet think themselves poor_ and will not be persuaded that they are rich_ or_ at least_ will not own it; by their doubts and fears_ their complaints and griefs_ they make themselves poor. The former mistake is destroying at last; this is disquieting in the mean time.,20250223
There are secrets in the divine wisdom_ arcana imperii—state-secrets. God's way is in the sea. Clouds and darkness are round about him. He has reasons of state which we cannot fathom and must not pry into. ,20250223
There are some sinners whom God sometimes out of the common road of Providence to meet with; such are these. The destruction of Sodom is a strange punishment. Is there not alienation (so some read it) to the workers of iniquity? This is the sinfulness of the sin that it alienates the mind from God (Eph. iv. 18_ and this is the punishment of the sinners that they shall be eternally set at a distance from him_ Rev. xxii,20250223
There are some that will make a jest of every thing_ though it be ever so prudently and pertinently spoken_ that will not only despise a wise man's words_ but despise even the wisdom of them_ that in them which is most improvable for their own edification; they will particularly reproach that_ as if it had an ill design upon them_ which they must guard against.,20250223
There are some truths so plain_ and so universally known and believed_ that one may venture to appeal to any of the saints concerning them. However there are some things about which they unhappily differ_ there are many more_ and more considerable_ in which they are agreed; as the evil of sin_ the vanity of the world_ the worth of the soul_ the necessity of a holy life_ and the like. Though they do not all live up_ as they should_ to their belief of these truths_ yet they are all ready to bear their testimony to them.,20250223
There are those that are not only vicious themselves_ but spiteful and mischievous to others_ and they are the worst of men; two sorts of such are here described:—1. Such as envy a man the honour of his good name_ and do all they can to blast that by calumnies and misrepresentations: They dig up evil; they take a great deal of pains to find out something or other on which to ground a slander_ or which may give some colour to it. If none appear above ground_ rather than want it they will dig for it_ by diving into what is secret_ or looking a great way back_ or by evil suspicions and surmises_ and forced innuendos. In the lips of a slanderer and backbiter there is as a fire_ not only to brand his neighbour's reputation_ to smoke and sully it_ but as a burning fire to consume it. And how great a matter does a little of this fire kindle_ and how hardly is it extinguished! James iii. 5_ 6,20250223
There are those that pretend to bid their friends welcome that are not hearty and sincere in it. They have a fair tongue_ and know what they should say: Eat and drink_ saith he_ because it is expected that the master of the feast should so compliment his guests; but they have an evil eye_ and grudge their guests every bit they eat_ especially if the eat freely. They would seem to be liberal in making the entertainment_ and would have the credit of it_ but they have so great a love to their money_ and so little to their friends_ that they cannot have the comfort of it_ nor any enjoyment of themselves or their friends. The miser's feast is his penance. If a man be so very selfish_ and sordid_ and mean that he cannot find in his heart to bid his friends welcome to what he has_ he ought not to add to that the guilt of dissimulation by inviting them_ but let him own himself to be what he is_ that the vile person may not be called liberal nor the churl bountiful_ Isa. xxxii,20250223
There are those that through grace have an interest in this Redeemer_ and can_ upon good grounds_ call him theirs. When Job had lost all his wealth and all his friends_ yet he was not separated from Christ_ nor cut off from his relation to him: __Still he is my Redeemer.__ That next kinsman adhered to him when all his other kindred forsook him_ and he had the comfort of it. ,20250223
There are those who_ by inuring themselves to cruelty_ come at last to be so exceedingly boisterous that they are the terror of the mighty in the land of the living (v. 22): __He draws the mighty into a snare with his power; even the greatest are not able to stand before him when he is in his mad fits: he rises up in his passion_ and lays about him with so much fury that no man is sure of his life; nor can he at the same time be sure of his own_ for his hand is against every man and every man's hand against him___ Gen. xvi,20250223
There are two sorts of lies equally detestable:—1. A slandering lie_ which avowedly hates those it is spoken of: A lying tongue hates those that are afflicted by it; it afflicts them by calumnies and reproaches because it hates them_ and can thus smite them secretly where they are without defence; and it hates them because it has afflicted them and made them its enemies. The mischief of this is open and obvious; it afflicts_ it hates_ and owns it_ and every body sees it,20250223
There are words that are curing and healing: The tongue of the wise is health_ closing up those wounds which the backbiting tongue had given_ making all whole again_ restoring peace_ and accommodating matters in variance and persuading to reconciliation. Wisdom will find out proper remedies against the mischiefs that are made by detraction and evil-speaking.,20250223
There have been many_ but such a one as this cannot be paralleled. Who can find her equal? She excels them all. Note_ Those that are good should aim and covet to excel in virtue. Many daughters_ in their father's house_ and in the single state_ have done virtuously_ but a good wife_ if she be virtuous_ excels them all_ and does more good in her place than they can do in theirs. Or_ as some explain it_ A man cannot have his house so well kept by good daughters_ as by a good wife. ,20250223
There is a clear shining after rain_ 2 Sam. xxiii,20250223
There is a day coming when the upright shall have the dominion (Ps. xlix. when the foolish virgins shall come begging to the wise for oil_ and shall knock in vain at that gate of the Lord at which the righteous entered.,20250223
There is a great deal of toil and trouble to be seen among the children of men. Labour and sorrow fill the world. ,20250223
There is a great variety of these pleasant fruits_ with which our souls should be well stocked; we must have all sorts of them_ grace for all occasions_ new and old_ as the good householder has in his treasury_ not only the products of this year_ but remainders of the last_ Matt.,20250223
There is a judgment to come_ in which every man's eternal state will be finally determined,20250223
There is a judgment to come. ,20250223
There is a selfish fear of God springing from dreadful thoughts of him_ which may be a good step towards religion_ Acts ix,20250223
There is a time when it is the wisdom of rulers to use severe methods_ but there is a time when it is as much their wisdom to take a more gentle course_ and to apply themselves to lenitives_ not corrosives,20250223
There is a way which is peculiarly the way of good men_ the way in which good men_ as such_ and as far as they have really been such_ have always walked,20250223
There is a wonderful harmony in the divine Providence and all its disposals_ so that the events of it_ when they come to be considered in their relations and tendencies_ together with the seasons of them_ will appear very beautiful_ to the glory of God and the comfort of those that trust in him. Though we see not the complete beauty of Providence_ yet we shall see it_ and a glorious sight it will be_ when the mystery of God shall be finished. Then every thing shall appear to have been done in the most proper time and it will be the wonder of eternity_ Deut. xxxii. 4; Ezek. i. 18.,20250223
There is always some good to be gotten by a wise and good man: His understanding is a well-spring of life to him_ which always flows and can never be drawn dry; he has something to say upon all occasions that is instructive_ and of use to those that will make use of it_ things new and old to bring out of his treasure; at least_ his understanding is a spring of life to himself_ yielding him abundant satisfaction; within his own thoughts he entertains and edifies himself_ if not others.,20250223
There is an end of all our acquaintance with this world and the things of it: The dead know not any thing of that which_ while they lived_ they were intimately conversant with. It does not appear that they know any thing of what is done by those they leave behind. Abraham is ignorant of us; they are removed into darkness_ Job x,20250223
There is an end of all our enjoyments in this world: They have no more a reward for their toils about the world_ but all they got must be left to others; they have a reward for their holy actions_ but not for their worldly ones. The meats and the belly will be destroyed together_ John vi. 27,20250223
There is an end of their affections_ their friendships and enmities: Their love_ and their hatred_ and their envy have now perished; the good things they loved_ the evil things they hated_ the prosperity of others_ which they envied_ are now all at an end with them. Death parts those that loved one another_ and puts an end to their friendship_ and those that hated one another too_ and puts an end to their quarrels. Actio moritur cum personâ—The person and his actions die together. There we shall be never the better for our friends (their love can do us no kindness)_ nor ever the worse for our enemies—their hatred and envy can do us no damage. There the wicked cease from troubling. Those things which now so affect us and fill us_ which we are so concerned about and so jealous of_ will there be at an end.,20250223
There is an end of their name. There are but few whose names survive them long; the grave is a land of forgetfulness_ for the memory of those that are laid there is soon forgotten; their place knows them no more_ nor the lands they called by their own names. ,20250223
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun_ as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: 6 Folly is set in great dignity_ and the rich sit in low place. 7 I have seen servants upon horses_ and princes walking as servants upon the earth. 8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh a hedge_ a serpent shall bite him. 9 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. 10 If the iron be blunt_ and he do not whet the edge_ then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. 11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.,20250223
There is another probable sense of these words_ that he does hereby_ as it were_ lay his death upon his friends_ who broke his heart with their harsh censures_ and charges the guilt of his blood upon them_ begging of God to avenge it and that the cry of his blood might have no place in which to lie hid_ but might come up to heaven and be heard by him that makes inquisition for blood.,20250223
There is cause to complain_ not only of the want of sincerity in men's profession of friendship_ and that they do not love so well as they pretend nor will serve their friends so much as they promise_ but_ which is much worse_ of wicked designs in the profession of friendship_ and the making of it subservient to the most malicious intentions. This is here spoken of as a common thing (v. 24): He that hates his neighbour_ and is contriving to do him a mischief_ yet dissembles with his lips_ professes to have a respect for him and to be ready to serve him_ talks kindly with him_ as Cain with Abel_ asks_ Art thou in health_ my brother? as Joab to Amasa_ that his malice may not be suspected and guarded against_ and so he may have the fairer opportunity to execute the purposes of it_ this man lays up deceit within him_ that is_ he keeps in his mind the mischief he intends to do his neighbour till he catches him at an advantage. This is malice which has no less of the subtlety than it has of the venom of the old serpent in it. Now_ as to this matter_ we are here cautioned,20250223
There is good reason why we should work the works of him that sent us while it is day_ because the night comes_ wherein no man can work_ John ix,20250223
There is in God a dreadful excellency. He is the most excellent Being_ has all excellencies in himself and in each infinitely excels any creature. His excellencies in themselves are amiable and lovely. He is the most beautiful Being; but considering man's distance from God by nature_ and his defection and degeneracy by sin_ his excellencies are dreadful. His power_ holiness_ justice_ yea_ and his goodness too_ are dreadful excellencies. They shall fear the Lord and his goodness. ,20250223
There is leanness in the soul_ when the body is fed to the full_ Ps. cvi,20250223
There is little hope of those that will not so much as hear rebuke with any patience_ but scorn to submit to government and scoff at those that deal faithfully with them. How can those mend a fault who will not be told of it_ but count those their enemies who do them that kindness?,20250223
There is many a one ruined by an ungoverned tongue: He that opens widely his lips_ to let our quod in buccam venerit—whatever comes uppermost_ that loves to bawl_ and bluster_ and make a noise_ and affects such a liberty of speech as bids defiance both to God and man_ he shall have destruction. it will be the destruction of his reputation_ his interest_ his comfort_ and his soul for ever_ Jam. iii. 6.,20250223
There is more hope of a publican than of a proud Pharisee_ Matt. xxi,20250223
There is no continuance in it; their candle shines brightly_ but it shall presently be put out_ and a final period put to all their comforts_ Job xxi. 14; Ps. xxxvii. 1_ 2.,20250223
There is no error in God's judgment_ and therefore there lies no exception against it_ nor appeal from it. ,20250223
There is no escaping by absconding (v. 20): __Desire not the night_ which often favours the retreat of a conquered army and covers it; think not that thou canst so escape the righteous judgment of God_ for the darkness hideth not from him___ Ps. cxxxix. 11_ 12. See ch. xxxiv,20250223
There is no escaping by money_ no purchasing a pardon with silver_ or gold_ and such corruptible things: __Even a great ransom cannot deliver thee when God enters into judgment with thee. His justice cannot be bribed_ nor any of the ministers of his justice. Will he esteem thy riches_ and take from them a commutation of the punishment? No_ not gold_ v,20250223
There is no escaping by rescue: __If all the forces of strength were at thy command_ if thou couldst muster ever so many servants and vassals to appear for thee to force thee out of the hands of divine vengeance_ it were all in vain; God would not regard it. There is none that can deliver out of his hand.__ ,20250223
There is no releasing those whom God has condemned to a perpetual imprisonment; if he shut up a man by sickness_ reduce him to straits_ and embarrass him in his affairs_ there can be no opening. He shuts up in the grave_ and none can break open those sealed doors—shuts up in hell_ in chains of darkness_ and none can pass that great gulf fixed.,20250223
There is no thought of his that he can be hindered from the execution of. Whatever the Lord pleased_ that did he. Job had said this passionately_ complaining of it (ch. xxiii.,20250223
There is no thought of ours that he can be hindered from the knowledge of. Not a fretful_ discontented_ unbelieving thought is in our minds at any time but God is a witness to it. It is in vain to contest with him; for we cannot hide our counsels and projects from him_ and_ if he discover them_ he can defeat them.,20250223
There is no true happiness in it: Thee shall be no reward to the evil man; his prosperity only serves for his present subsistence; these are all the good things he must ever expect: there is none intended him in the world of retribution. He has his reward_ Matt. vi,20250223
There is not only life at the end_ but there is life in the way; all true comfort and satisfaction. The favour of God_ which is better than life; the Spirit_ who is life. ,20250223
There is not only life in it_ but so as that in it there is no death_ none of that sorrow of the world which works death and is an allay to our present joy and life. There is no end of that life that is in the way of righteousness. Here there is life_ but there is death too. In the way of righteousness there is life_ and no death_ life and immortality.,20250223
There is not only something to be had_ but something to be done_ in this life_ and the chief good we are to enquire after is the good we should do_ Eccl. ii,20250223
There is nothing in this world we are born to_ and can truly call our own_ but sin and trouble; both are as the sparks that fly upwards. Actual transgressions are the sparks that fly out of the furnace of original corruption; and_ being called transgressors from the womb_ no wonder that we deal very treacherously_ Isa. xlviii,20250223
There is sadness under it. Sometimes when sinners are under convictions_ or some great trouble_ they dissemble their grief by a forced mirth_ and put a good face on it_ because they will not seem to yield: they cry not when he binds them. Nay_ when men really are merry_ yet at the same time there is some alloy or other to their mirth_ something that casts a damp upon it_ which all their gaiety cannot keep from their heart. Their consciences tell them they have no reason to be merry (Hos. ix. 1); they cannot but see the vanity of it. Spiritual joy is seated in the soul; the joy of the hypocrite is but from the teeth outward. See John xvi. 22,20250223
There is that which seems designed for instruction_ but really tends to the destruction of young men. The factors for vice will undertake to teach them free thoughts and a fashionable conversation_ how to palliate the sins they have a mind to and stop the mouth of their own consciences_ how to get clear of the restraints of their education and to set up for wits and beaux. This is the instruction which causes to err from the forms of sound words_ which should be held fast in faith and love,20250223
There is the north wind of convictions_ and the south wind of comforts; but all_ like the wind_ brought out of God's treasuries and fulfilling his word. ,20250223
There is worse after it: The end of that mirth is heaviness. It is soon over_ like the crackling of thorns under a pot; and_ if the conscience be awake_ all sinful and profane mirth will be reflected upon with bitterness; if not_ the heaviness will be so much the greater when for all these things God shall bring the sinner into judgment. The sorrows of the saints will end in everlasting joys (Ps. cxxvi. but the laughter of fools will end in endless weeping and wailing.,20250223
There must be a great deal of pains taken to get it_ and a great deal of care not to forget it; the more we know the more we see there is to be known_ and consequently we perceive with greater clearness that our work is without end_ and the more we see of our former mistakes and blunders_ which occasions much grief. The more we see of men's different sentiments and opinions (and it is that which a great deal of our learning is conversant about) the more at a loss we are_ it may be_ which is in the right. Those that increase knowledge have so much the more quick and sensible perception of the calamities of this world_ and for one discovery they make that is pleasing_ perhaps_ they make ten that are displeasing_ and so they increase sorrow. Let us not therefore be driven off from the pursuit of any useful knowledge_ but put on patience to break through the sorrow of it; but let us despair of finding true happiness in this knowledge_ and expect it only in the knowledge of God and the careful discharge of our duty to him. He that increases in heavenly wisdom_ and in an experimental acquaintance with the principles_ powers_ and pleasures of the spiritual and divine life_ increases joy_ such as will shortly be consummated in everlasting joy.,20250223
There was that in his case which was very surprising and astonishing_ and therefore both needed and deserved their most serious consideration. It was not a common case_ but a very extraordinary one. ,20250223
There were children of God scattered abroad (John xi. 52) besides the incorporated children of the kingdom_ Matt. viii. 11_ 12. ,20250223
There will be a latter day_ a last day_ a day when time shall be no more_ Rev. x,20250223
There will be an end of the prosperity of the wicked_ therefore do not envy them (Ps. lxxiii. 17); there will be an end of thy afflictions_ therefore be not weary of them_ an end of thy services_ thy work and warfare will be accomplished_ perfect love will shortly cast out fear_ and thy expectation of the reward not only will be not cut off_ or disappointed_ but it will be infinitely outdone. The consideration of the end will help to reconcile us to all the difficulties and discouragements of the way.,20250223
There_ in the court of heaven_ when the final sentence is to be given_ the righteous might dispute with him and come off in his righteousness. Now_ even the upright are often chastened of the Lord_ and they cannot dispute against it; integrity itself is no fence either against calamity or calumny; but in that day they shall not be condemned with the world_ though God may afflict by prerogative. Then you shall discern between the righteous and the wicked (Mal. iii. so vast will be the difference between them in their everlasting state; whereas now we can scarcely distinguish them_ so little is the difference between them as to their outward condition_ for all things come alike to all. Then_ when the final doom is given_ __I shall be delivered for ever from my Judge___ that is_ __I shall be saved from the unjust censures of my friends and from that divine sentence which is now so much a terror to me.__ Those that are delivered up to God as their owner and ruler shall be for ever delivered from him as their judge and avenger; and there is no flying from his justice but by flying to his mercy.,20250223
Thereby it deprives them of the most necessary supports: Those that will not plough in seed-time cannot expect to reap in harvest; and therefore they must beg their bread with astonishment when the diligent are bringing home their sheaves with joy. He that will not submit to the labour of ploughing must submit to the shame of begging. They shall beg in harvest_ and yet have nothing; no_ not then when there is great plenty. Though it may be charity to relieve sluggards_ yet a man may_ in justice_ not relieve them; they deserve to be left to starve. Those that would not provide oil in their vessels begged when the bridegroom came_ and were denied.,20250223
Therefore Wisdom leads in the paths of righteousness_ not only that she may keep her friends in the way of duty and obedience_ but that she may cause them to inherit substance and may fill their treasures_ which cannot be done with the things of this world_ nor with any thing less than God and heaven. The happiness of those that love God_ and devote themselves to his service_ is substantial and satisfactory. ,20250223
Therefore it is that they are evil men; their wickedness is the effect of their ignorance and error_ Eph. iv. 18,20250223
Therefore let us not fear the pride of others_ but greatly fear pride in ourselves.,20250223
Therefore the prayer of the upright is his delight_ because he is a friend of God_ and he loves him who_ though he have not yet attained_ is following after righteousness_ aiming at it and pressing towards it_ as St. Paul_ Phil. iii. 13.,20250223
Therefore they understand not judgment_ because they are evil men; their corruptions blind their eyes_ and fill them with prejudices_ and because they do evil they hate the light. It is just with God also to give them up to strong delusions.,20250223
These are called witnesses against him_ witnesses of God's displeasure against him_ and such witnesses as his friends produced against him to prove him a wicked man. Or_ __They are witnesses for me_ that my complaint is not causeless___ or __witnesses to me_ that I am a dying man_ and must be gone shortly.__,20250223
These are still the words of Christ to his church_ expressing his great esteem of her and affection to her_ the opinion he had of her beauty and excellency_ the desire he had of_ and the delight he had in_ her converse and society. And so ought men to love their wives as Christ loves the church_ and takes pleasure in it as if it were spotless and had no fault_ when yet it is compassed with infirmity. Now_ observe here_,20250223
These are the best of the kind. Does the colour of the bed_ and the furniture belonging to it_ help to set it off? Our bed is green_ a colour which_ in a pastoral_ is preferred before any other_ because it is the colour of the fields and groves where the shepherd's business and delight are. It is a refreshing colour_ good for the eyes; and it denotes fruitfulness. I am like a green olive-tree_ Ps. lii,20250223
These are the words of the daughters of Jerusalem_ to whom the charge was given_ v,20250223
These are the words of the spouse_ the church_ the believing soul_ in answer to the kind expressions of Christ's love in the foregoing verses.,20250223
These bloody men would do this as greedily as the hungry lion devours the lamb. If it be objected_ __The remains of the murdered will betray the murderers;__ they answer_ __No danger of that; we will swallow them whole as those that are buried.__ Who could imagine that human nature should degenerate so far that it should ever be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! 2. Their covetousness. They hope to get a good booty by it (v. 13): __We shall find all precious substance by following this trade. What though we venture our necks by it? we shall fill our houses with spoil.__ See here_ ,20250223
These creatures are serviceable to wicked men_ and so they declare their prosperity. Ask the herds and the flocks to whom they belong_ and they will tell you that such a robber_ such an oppressor_ is their owner: the fishes and fowls will tell you that they are served up to the tables_ and feed the luxury_ of proud sinners. The earth brings forth her fruits to them (ch. ix. and the whole creation groans under the burden of their tyranny_ Rom. viii. 20_ 22. Note_ All the creatures which wicked men abuse_ by making them the food and fuel of their lusts_ will witness against them another day_ Jam. v. 3_ 4.,20250223
These days shall not be prolonged to what he promised himself; he shall not live out half his days_ Ps. lv,20250223
These fields and vineyards are often in a very bad state_ not only no fruit brought forth_ but all overgrown with thorns and nettles (scratching_ stinging_ inordinate lusts and passions_ pride_ covetousness_ sensuality_ malice_ those are the thorns and nettles_ the wild grapes_ which the unsanctified heart produces)_ no guard kept against the enemy_ but the stone-wall broken down_ and all lies in common_ all exposed. ,20250223
These five books of scripture which are contained in this third volume and which I have here endeavoured_ according to the measure of the gift given to me_ to explain and improve_ for the use of those who desire to read them_ not only with understanding_ but to their edification—though they have the same divine origin_ design_ and authority_ as those that went before_ yet_ upon some accounts_ are of a very different nature from them_ and from the rest of the sacred writings_ such variety of methods has Infinite Wisdom seen fit to take in conveying the light of divine revelation to the children of men_ that this heavenly food might have (as the Jews say of the manna) something in it agreeable to every palate and suited to every constitution. If every eye be not thus opened_ every mouth will be stopped_ and such as perish in their ignorance will be left without excuse. We have piped unto you_ and you have not danced_ we have mourned unto you_ and you have not lamented_ Matt. xi. 17.,20250223
These must be carefully laid up for him_ devoted to his service and honour_ must be always ready to us when we have occasion for them_ as that which is laid up at our gates_ that_ by our bringing forth much fruit_ he may be glorified_ John xv,20250223
These seem to be the words of the spouse_ the church_ in answer to the commendations which Christ_ the bridegroom_ had given of her as a pleasant fruitful garden. Is she a garden?,20250223
These terrors put him either ,20250223
These two verses are a comment upon v. 4_ and show,20250223
These two verses are to the same purport with those next before_ intimating the happiness of the godly and the misery of the wicked; it is necessary that this be inculcated upon us_ so loth are we to believe and consider it. 1. Strength and stability are entailed upon integrity: The way of the Lord (the providence of God_ the way in which he walks towards us) is strength to the upright_ confirms him in his uprightness. All God's dealings with him_ merciful and afflictive_ serve to quicken him to his duty and animate him against his discouragements. Or the way of the Lord (the way of godliness_ in which he appoints us to walk) is strength to the upright; the closer we keep to that way_ the more our hearts are enlarged to proceed in it_ the better fitted we are both for services and sufferings. A good conscience_ kept pure from sin_ gives a man boldness in a dangerous time_ and constant diligence in duty makes a man's work easy in a busy time. The more we do for God the more we may do_ Job xvii,20250223
These two verses are_ in effect_ the same_ and both to the same purport with v,20250223
These two verses show the intolerable mischief,20250223
These two verses show the power of kings_ which is every where great_ but was especially so in those eastern countries_ where they were absolute and arbitrary. Whom they would they slew and whom they would they kept alive. Their will was a law. We have reason to bless God for the happy constitution of the government we live under_ which maintains the prerogative of the prince without any injury to the liberty of the subject. But here it is intimated,20250223
These two verses speak to the same purport_ and the latter may be the reason of the former. 1. That wealth which men get unjustly will do them no good_ because God will blast it: Treasures of wickedness profit nothing_ v,20250223
These verses are an introduction to his warning against fleshly lusts_ much the same with that_ ch. vi. 20_ &c._ and ending (v. 5) as that did (v.,20250223
These verses describe another sort of sinners who therefore go unpunished_ because they go undiscovered. They rebel against the light_ v,20250223
These wearisome nights were appointed to him. God_ who determines the times before appointed_ had allotted him such nights as these. Whatever is at any time grievous to us_ it is good to see it appointed for us_ that we may acquiesce in the event_ not only as unavoidable because appointed_ but as therefore designed for some holy end. When we have comfortable nights we must see them also appointed to us and be thankful for them; many better than we have wearisome nights.,20250223
These words are Christ's answer to the church's prayer in the close of the foregoing chapter_ Let my beloved come into his garden; here he has come_ and lets her know it. See how ready God is to hear prayer_ how ready Christ is to accept the invitations that his people give him_ though we are backward to hear his calls and accept his invitations. He is free in condescending to us_ while we are shy of ascending to him. Observe how the return answered the request_ and outdid it. 1. She called him her beloved (and really he was so)_ and invited him because she loved him; in return to this_ he called her his sister and spouse_ as several times before_ ch. iv. Those that make Christ their best beloved shall be owned by him in the nearest and dearest relations,20250223
These words recommend family-love and peace_ as conducing very much to the comfort of human life. 1. Those that live in unity and quietness_ not only free from jealousies and animosities_ but vying in mutual endearments_ and obliging to one another_ live very comfortably_ though they are low in the world_ work hard and fare hard_ though they have but each of them a morsel_ and that a dry morsel. There may be peace and quietness where there are not three meals a day_ provided there by a joint satisfaction in God's providence and a mutual satisfaction in each other's prudence. Holy love may be found in a cottage,20250223
These words_ to those that know how to relish them,20250223
They abused him too with their fair promises_ for in them they did but banter him. He reckons them (v. 5) among those that speak flattery to their friends. They all came to mourn with him. Eliphaz began with a commendation of him_ ch. iv,20250223
They abused him with their foul censures_ condemning him as a bad man_ justly reduced thus and exposed to contempt_ v,20250223
They accused him falsely_ and misrepresented his former conversation_ which is here called marring his path. They reflected upon him as a tyrant and an oppressor because he had done justice upon them; and perhaps Job's friends grounded their uncharitable censures of him (ch. xxii. 6_ &c.) upon the unjust and unreasonable clamours of these sorry people; and it was an instance of their great weakness and inconsideration_ for who can be innocent if the accusations of such persons may be heeded? ,20250223
They all come upon him at once; while one messenger of evil tidings was speaking another came_ and_ before he had told his story_ a third_ and a fourth_ followed immediately. Thus Satan_ by the divine permission_ ordered it,20250223
They all did it_ even those who afterwards fell and left their first estate. Even those who have praised God may_ by the deceitful power of sin_ be brought to blaspheme him_ and yet God will be eternally praised.,20250223
They all died together_ and not one of them was left alive. David_ though a wise and good man_ was very much discomposed by the death of one son. How hard then did it bear upon poor Job who lost them all_ and_ in one moment_ was written childless! ,20250223
They and their families were the unprofitable burdens of the earth_ and good for nothing. Job himself_ with all his prudence and patience_ could make nothing of them_ v,20250223
They appear_ but they will soon disappear again_ and man in herein like the flower of the field_ Job xiv,20250223
They are all plain_ and not hard to be understood. If the book is sealed_ it is to those who are willingly ignorant. If our gospel is hidden_ it is hidden to those who are lost; but to those who depart from evil_ which is understanding_ who have that good understanding which those have who do the commandments_ to them they are all plain and there is nothing difficult in them. The way of religion is a highway_ and the way-faring men_ though fools_ shall not err therein_ Isa. xxxv.,20250223
They are all right_ and not hard to be submitted to. Those who discern things that differ_ who know good and evil_ readily subscribe to the rectitude of all Wisdom's dictates_ and therefore_ with out murmuring or disputing_ govern themselves by them.,20250223
They are diligent and take pains at it: They rise betimes for a prey. If a traveller be out early_ they will be out as soon to rob him. They live by it as a man lives by his trade: The wilderness (not the grounds there but the roads there) yieldeth food for them and for their children; they maintain themselves and their families by robbing on the high-way_ and bless themselves in it without any remorse of compassion or conscience_ and with as much security as if it were honestly got; as Ephraim_ Hos. xii. 7_ 8,20250223
They are directed to the children of men. We attend to that discourse in which we hear ourselves named_ though otherwise we should have neglected it; therefore Wisdom speaks to us: __Unto you_ O men! I call (v. not to angels (they need not these instructions)_ not to devils (they are past them)_ not to the brute-creatures (they are not capable of them)_ but to you_ O men! who are taught more than the beasts of the earth and made wiser than the fowls of heaven. To you is this law given_ to you is the word of this invitation_ this exhortation sent. My voice is to the sons of men_ who are concerned to receive instruction_ and to whom_ one would think_ it should be very welcome. It is not_ to you_ O Jews! only_ that Wisdom cries_ nor to you_ O gentlemen! not to you_ O scholars! but to you_ O men! O sons of men! even the meanest.__ 6. They are designed to make them wise (v. 5); they are calculated not only for men that are capable of wisdom_ but for sinful men_ fallen men_ foolish men_ that need it_ and are undone without it: __O you simple ones! understand wisdom. Though you are ever so simple_ Wisdom will take you for her scholars_ and not only so_ but_ if you will be ruled by her_ will undertake to give you an understanding heart.__ When sinners leave their sins_ and become truly religious_ then the simple understand wisdom.,20250223
They are disquieting_ ver. 12.,20250223
They are dying daily_ and continually wasting: Destroyed from morning to evening. Death is still working in us_ like a mole digging our grave at each remove_ and we so continually lie exposed that we are killed all the day long. ,20250223
They are easy and quiet_,20250223
They are easy there_ and make no complaints; there believers sleep in Jesus. ,20250223
They are far above us_ and God is far above them; how much then is he set out of the reach either of our sins or of our services! Look unto the heavens_ and behold the clouds. God made man erect_ coelumque tueri jussit—and bade him look up to heaven. Idolaters looked up_ and worshipped the hosts of heaven_ the sun_ moon_ and stars; but we must look up to heaven_ and worship the Lord of those hosts. They are higher than we_ but God is infinitely above them. His glory is above the heavens (Ps. viii. 1) and the knowledge of him higher than heaven_ ch. xi. 8,20250223
They are greedy_ and glad of that which gives them an opportunity to sin: The mouth of the wicked eagerly devours iniquity_ drinks it in like water_ Job,20250223
They are heedless and fearless of danger_ and senseless of the rebukes they are under either from God or man. They are in imminent danger of death_ of damnation_ lie as much exposed as if they slept upon the top of a mast_ and yet are secure and sleep on. They fear no peril when the terrors of the Lord are laid before them; nay_ they feel no pain when the judgments of God are actually upon them; they cry not when he binds them. Set a drunkard in the stocks_ and he is not sensible of the punishment. __They have stricken me_ and I was not sick; I felt it not: it made no impression at all upon me.__ Drunkenness turns me into stocks and stones; they are scarcely to be reckoned animals; they are dead while they live.,20250223
They are here consulting about a vineyard they had in the country_ the church of Christ on earth considered under the notion of a vineyard (v. 11_ 12): Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon_ had a kingdom in the possession of a multitude_ a numerous people. As he was a type of Christ_ so his vineyard was a type of the church of Christ. Our Saviour has given us a key to these verses in the parable of the vineyard let out to the unthankful husbandmen_ Matt. xxi,20250223
They are his institutions and their privileges; in them Christ and believers meet. She does not call them mine_ for a believer will own nothing as his but what Christ shall have an interest in_ nor thine_ for Christ has said_ All that I have is thine_ Luke xv,20250223
They are left to ruin themselves_ and Wisdom will not hinder them_ because they have set at nought all her counsel. 1. Their crime is very great; they sin against Wisdom_ rebel against its light and laws_ thwart its designs_ and by their folly offend it. They sin against Christ; they act in contempt of his authority_ and in contradiction to all the purposes of his life and death. This is construed into hating Wisdom_ hating Christ; they are his enemies_ who will not have him to reign over them. What can appear worse than hating him who is the centre of all beauty and fountain of all goodness_ love itself? 2. Their punishment will be very just_ for they wilfully bring it upon themselves. ,20250223
They are light and worthless_ and of no account either with God or with wise and good men. They are fitted to destruction_ and continually lie exposed to it_ and in the height of their pomp and power there is but a step between them and ruin,20250223
They are like the silly bird_ that sees the net spread to take her_ and yet it is in vain; she is decoyed into it by the bait_ and will not take the warning which her own eyes gave her_ v.,20250223
They are marvellous_ and such as never can be sufficiently admired; eternity itself will be short enough to be spent in the admiration of them. Now_ by the consideration of this_ Eliphaz intends_ ,20250223
They are merry and live a jovial life (v. 11_ 12): They send forth their little ones abroad among their neighbours_ like a flock_ in great numbers_ to sport themselves. They have their balls and music-meetings_ at which their children dance; and dancing is fittest for children_ who know not better how to spend their time and whose innocency guards them against the mischiefs that commonly attend it. Though the parents are not so very youthful and frolicsome as to dance themselves_ yet they take the timbrel and harp; they pipe_ and their children dance after their pipe_ and they know no grief to put their instruments out of tune or to withhold their hearts from any joy. Some observe that this is an instance of their vanity_ as well as of their prosperity. Here is none of that care taken of their children which Abraham took of his_ to teach them the way of the Lord_ Gen. xviii,20250223
They are mighty in power_ are preferred to places of authority and trust_ and not only make a great figure_ but bear a great sway. Vivit imo_ et in senatum venit—He not only lives_ but appears in the senate. Now wherefore is it so? Note_ It is worth while to enquire into the reasons of the outward prosperity of wicked people. It is not because God has forsaken the earth_ because he does not see_ or does not hate_ or cannot punish their wickedness; but it is because the measure of their iniquities is not full. This is the day of God's patience_ and_ in some way or other_ he makes use of them and their prosperity to serve his own counsels_ while it ripens them for ruin; but the chief reason is because he will make it to appear there is another world which is the world of retribution_ and not this.,20250223
They are more enriching to us and more adorning. They make us rich towards God_ rich in good works_ 1 Tim. ii. 9_ 10. Most people are fond of gold_ and a ruby or two will not serve_ they must have a multitude of them_ a cabinet of jewels; but he that has the lips of knowledge despises these_ because he knows and possesses better things.,20250223
They are more rare in themselves_ more scarce and hard to be got. There is gold in many a man's pocket that has no grace in his heart. In Solomon's time there was plenty of gold (1 Kings x. 21) and abundance of rubies; every body wore them; they were to be bought in every town. But wisdom is a rare thing_ a precious jewel; few have it so as to do good with it_ nor is it to be purchased of the merchants. 2.,20250223
They are more thankful for their enjoyments: The hungry will bless God for bread and water_ while those that are full think the greatest dainties and varieties scarcely worth giving thanks for. The virgin Mary seems to refer to this when she says (Luke i.,20250223
They are multiplied_ and their family is built up_ and they have the satisfaction of seeing it (v. 8): Their seed is established in their sight. This is put first_ as that which gives both a pleasant enjoyment and a pleasing prospect. ,20250223
They are not fit to deliver wise sayings_ nor should they undertake to handle any matter of weight_ though they should be instructed concerning it_ and be able to say something to it. Wise sayings_ as a foolish man delivers them and applies them (in such a manner that one may know he does not rightly understand them)_ lose their excellency and usefulness: A parable in the mouth of fools ceases to be a parable_ and becomes a jest. If a man who lives a wicked life_ yet speaks religiously and takes God's covenant into his mouth_ ,20250223
They are not fit to have any honour put upon them. He had said (v. 1)_ Honour is not seemly for a fool; here he shows that it is lost and thrown away upon him_ as if a man should throw a precious stone_ or a stone fit to be used in weighing_ into a heap of common stones_ where it would be buried and of no use; it is as absurd as if a man should dress up a stone in purple (so others); nay_ it is dangerous_ it is like a stone bound in a sling_ with which a man will be likely to do hurt. To give honour to a fool is to put a sword in a madman's hand_ with which we know not what mischief he may do_ even to those that put it into his hand,20250223
They are now madmen_ and all the delights they seem to be blessed with are but like the pleasant dreams and fancies of a distracted man. They are mad upon their idols (Jer. l. are mad against God's people_ Acts xxvi,20250223
They are of incontestable equity_ and carry along with them the evidence of their own goodness. They are right things (v. all in righteousness (v. and nothing froward or perverse in them. All the dictates and directions of revealed religion are consonant to_ and perfective of_ the light and law of nature_ and there is nothing in them that puts any hardship upon us_ that lays us under any undue restraints_ unbecoming the dignity and liberty of the human nature_ nothing that we have reason to complain of. All God's precepts concerning all things are right,20250223
They are of inestimable value. They are excellent things (v. princely things_ so the word is. Though they are level to the capacity of the meanest_ yet there is that in them which will be entertainment for the greatest. They are divine and heavenly things_ so excellent that_ in comparison with them_ all other learning is but children's play. Things which relate to an eternal God_ an immortal soul_ and an everlasting state_ must needs be excellent things,20250223
They are of unquestionable truth. Wisdom's doctrines_ upon which her laws are founded_ are such as we may venture our immortal souls upon: My mouth shall speak truth (v. the whole truth_ and nothing but the truth_ for it is a testimony to the world. Every word of God is true; there are not so much as pious frauds in it_ nor are we imposed upon in that which is told us for our good. Christ is a faithful witness_ is the truth itself; wickedness (that is_ lying) is an abomination to his lips. Note_ Lying is wickedness_ and we should not only refrain from it_ but it should be an abomination to us_ and as far from what we say as from what God says to us. His word to us is yea_ and amen; never then let ours be yea and nay,20250223
They are perishing_ ver. 14,20250223
They are permanent_ and will be preserved to good purpose_ when flowers are withered and good for nothing. Grace_ ripened into glory_ will last for ever.,20250223
They are planted_ and do not grow of themselves; the trees of righteousness are the planting of the Lord (Isa. lxi. 3); grace springs from an incorruptible seed. ,20250223
They are pleasant to the palate_ but perhaps rise in the stomach_ turn sour there_ upbraid a man_ and make him sick. They do not yield men the satisfaction they promised themselves from them; for those that are given to appetite_ when they have that which is very dainty_ are not pleased; they are soon weary of it; they must have something else more dainty. The more a luxurious appetite is humoured and indulged the more humour some and troublesome it grows_ and the more hard to please; dainties will surfeit_ but never satisfy. But especially they are upon this account deceitful meat_ that_ while they please the body_ they prejudice the soul_ they overcharge the heart_ and unfit it for the service of God_ nay_ they take away the heart_ and alienate the mind from spiritual delights_ and spoil its relish of them. Why then should we covet that which will certainly cheat us?,20250223
They are pleasant_ and of a sweet savour to God and man_ and_ as strong aromatics_ diffuse their fragrancy. ,20250223
They are precious and of high value; hence we read of the precious sons of Zion and their precious faith; they are plants of renown. ,20250223
They are proclaimed aloud (v. 1): Does not Wisdom cry? Yes_ she cries aloud_ and does not spare (Isa. lviii. 1); she puts forth her voice_ as one in earnest and desirous to be heard. Jesus stood and cried_ John vii,20250223
They are proclaimed from on high (v. 2): She stands in the top of high places; it was from the top of Mount Sinai that the law was given_ and Christ expounded it in a sermon upon the mount. Nay_ if we slight divine revelation_ we turn away from him that speaks from heaven_ a high place indeed_ Heb. xii,20250223
They are proclaimed in the places of concourse_ where multitudes are gathered together_ the more the better. Jesus spoke in the synagogues and in the temple_ whither the Jews always resorted_ John xviii,20250223
They are proclaimed where they are most needed. They are intended for the guide of our way_ and therefore are published in the places of the paths_ where many ways meet_ that travellers may be shown_ if they will but ask_ which is the right way_ just then when they are at a loss; thou shalt then hear the word behind thee_ saying_ This is the way_ Isa. xxx,20250223
They are profitable and of great use. Saints are the blessings of this earth_ and their graces are their riches_ with which they trade as the merchants of the east with their spices. ,20250223
They are ready to welcome the manifestation of Christ's love to their souls by his Spirit_ and to return them in the humble professions of love to him and complacency in him_ above all. The fruit of his lips is peace_ Isa. lvii,20250223
They are resolute in sin (v. 15): Their ways are crooked_ a great many windings and turnings to escape the pursuit of their convictions and break the force of them; some sly excuse_ some subtle evasion or other_ their deceitful hearts furnish them with_ for the strengthening of their hands in their wickedness; and in the crooked mazes of that labyrinth they secure themselves from the arrests of God's word and their own consciences; for they are froward in their paths_ that is_ they are resolved to go on in them_ whatever is said against it. Every wise man will shun the company of such as these.,20250223
They are rich and thrive in their estates. Of this he gives only one instance_ v,20250223
They are said to distil the water in small drops_ not in spouts_ as when the windows of heaven were opened_ Gen. vii,20250223
They are scattered as sheep having no shepherd_ for want of the masters of assemblies to call them and keep them together_ Mark vi,20250223
They are scattered from God and their duty by apostasies_ from one another by divisions; God is provoked to scatter them by his judgments_ 2 Chron. xv. 3_,20250223
They are secure_ and not only feel no hurt_ but fear none_ are under no apprehensions of danger either from threatening providences or an awakened conscience. But those that provoke God are never the more safe for their being secure. ,20250223
They are so_ that is_ they should be so_ and_ if they conduct themselves worthily_ they are so.,20250223
They are the innocent_ not perfectly so_ but innocence is what they aim at and press towards. Sincerity is evangelical innocency_ and those that are upright are said to be innocent from the great transgression_ Ps. xix,20250223
They are the righteous_ who walk in the way of righteousness. ,20250223
They are themselves apostates from that which is good_ and such are commonly the most malicious and dangerous enemies religion has_ witness Julian (v. 13): They leave the paths of uprightness_ which they were trained up in and had set out in_ shake off the influences of their education_ and break off the thread of their hopeful beginnings_ to walk in the ways of darkness_ in those wicked ways which hate the light_ in which men are led blindfold by ignorance and error_ and which lead men into utter darkness. The ways of sin are ways of darkness_ uncomfortable and unsafe; what fools are those that leave the plain_ pleasant_ lightsome paths of uprightness_ to walk in those ways! Ps. lxxxii. 5,20250223
They are to be considered as really dangerous. These hills indeed are pleasant enough_ but there are in them lions' dens; they are mountains of the leopards_ mountains of prey_ though they seem glorious and excellent_ Ps. lxxvi.,20250223
They are unprofitable_ ver. 11,20250223
They are unsatisfying_ ver. 10,20250223
They are upright men_ honest and sincere_ and that act from a steady principle_ with a single eye. This was Job's own character (ch. i. 1)_ and probably he speaks of such upright men especially as had been his intimates and associates. ,20250223
They are very oppressive to the labourers they employ in their service. They not only give them no wages_ though the labourer is worthy of his hire (and this is a crying sin_ Jam. v. but they will not so much as give them meat and drink: Those that carry their sheaves are hungry; so some read it (v. and it agrees with v. 11_ that those who make oil within their walls_ and with a great deal of toil labour at the wine-presses_ yet suffer thirst_ which was worse than muzzling the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. Those masters forget that they have a Master in heaven who will not allow the necessary supports of life to their servants and labourers_ not caring whether they can live by their labour or no,20250223
They are wholesome. Many things are pleasant that are not profitable_ but these pleasant words are health to the bones_ to the inward man_ as well as sweet to the soul. They make the bones_ which sin has broken and put out of joint_ to rejoice. The bones are the strength of the body; and the good word of God is a means of spiritual strength_ curing the diseases that weaken us.,20250223
They are wonderfully acceptable and agreeable to those who take them aright_ who understand themselves aright_ who have not their judgments blinded and biassed by the world and the flesh_ are not under the power of prejudice_ are taught of God_ and whose understanding he has opened_ who impartially seek knowledge_ take pains for it_ and have found it in the enquiries they have hitherto made. To them_ ,20250223
They are worse than the birds_ and have not the sense which we sometimes perceive them to have; for the fowler knows it is in vain to lay his snare in the sight of the bird_ and therefore he has arts to conceal it. But the sinner sees ruin at the end of his way; the murderer_ the thief_ see the jail and the gallows before them_ nay_ they may see hell before them; their watchmen tell them they shall surely die_ but it is to no purpose; they rush into sin_ and rush on in it_ like the horse into the battle. For really the stone they roll will turn upon themselves_ v. 18_ 19. They lay wait_ and lurk privily_ for the blood and lives of others_ but it will prove_ contrary to their intention_ to be for their own blood_ their own lives; they will come_ at length_ to a shameful end; and_ if they escape the sword of the magistrate_ yet there is a divine Nemesis that pursues them. Vengeance suffers them not to live. Their greediness of gain hurries them upon those practices which will not suffer them to live out half their days_ but will cut off the number of their months in the midst. They have little reason to be proud of their property in that which takes away the life of the owners and then passes to other masters; and what is a man profited_ though he gain the world_ if he lose his life? For then he can enjoy the world no longer; much less if he lose his soul_ and that be drowned in destruction and perdition_ as multitudes are by the love of money.,20250223
They basely deceived him_ and that was unkind. They undertook his cure_ and pretended to be his physicians; but they were all physicians of no value_ __idol-physicians_ who can do me no more good than an idol can.__ They were worthless physicians_ who neither understood his case nor knew how to prescribe to him—mere empirics_ who pretended to great things_ but in conference added nothing to him: he was never the wiser for all they said. Thus to broken hearts and wounded consciences all creatures_ without Christ_ are physicians of no value_ on which one may spend all and be never the better_ but rather grow worse_ Mark v. 26.,20250223
They become old; they have the honour_ satisfaction_ and advantage of living long_ long enough to raise their families and estates. We read of a sinner a hundred years old_ Isa. lxv,20250223
They came to comfort him. __No___ says he_ __let this be your consolations (v. 2); if you have no other comforts to administer to me_ yet deny me not this; be so kind_ so just_ as to give me a patient hearing_ and that shall pass for your consolations of me.__ Nay_ they could not know how to comfort him if they would not give him leave to open his case and tell his own story. Or_ __It will be a consolation to yourselves_ in reflection_ to have dealt tenderly with your afflicted friend_ and not harshly.__ ,20250223
They came to give an account of their negotiations on earth and to receive new instructions. Satan was one of them originally; but how hast thou fallen_ O Lucifer! He shall no more stand in that congregation_ yet he is here represented_ as coming among them_ either summoned to appear as a criminal or connived at_ for the present_ though an intruder.,20250223
They came upon him with open mouth to devour him_ as if they would swallow him alive_ so terrible were their threats and so scornful was their conduct to him. They offered him all the indignities they could invent_ and even smote him on the cheek; and herein many were confederate. They gathered themselves together against him_ even the abjects_ Ps. xxxv,20250223
They cannot be fully seen_ but as the stars through the thin clouds. Some make it to intimate the bashfulness of her looks; she suffers not her eyes to wander_ but limits them with her locks.,20250223
They cannot fully see. As long as we are here in this world we know but in part_ for a hair hangs in our eyes; we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness; death will shortly cut those locks_ and then we shall see all things clearly. ,20250223
They choose that service which is perfect drudgery rather than that which is perfect liberty,20250223
They continued still to abuse him_ and seemed resolved to persist in it: __How long will you do it?__ v. 2_,20250223
They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty_ but it is a complaining cry_ a wailing cry_ not a penitent praying cry_ the cry of nature and passion_ not of grace. See Hos. vii. 14__ They have not cried unto me with their heart when they howled upon their beds. How then can we expect that they should be answered and relieved?,20250223
They dealt very hardly with her: They made me the keeper of the vineyards_ that is_ First_ __They seduced me to sin_ drew me into false worships_ to serve their gods_ which was like dressing the vineyards_ keeping the vine of Sodom; and they would not let me keep my own vineyard_ serve my own God_ and observe those pure worships which he gave me in charge_ and which I do and ever will own for mine.__ These are grievances which good people complain most of in a time of persecution_ that their consciences are forced_ and that those who rule them with rigour say to their souls_ Bow down_ that we may go over_ Isa. li,20250223
They desire their favour (Esth. vii.,20250223
They did what they could to provoke him and then condemned him for his resentment of it; but he thinks himself excusable when his eye continued thus in their provocation: it never ceased_ and he never could look off it. Note_ The unkindness of those that trample upon their friends in affliction_ that banter and abuse them then_ is enough to try_ if not to tire_ the patience even of Job himself.,20250223
They died by a wind of the devil's raising_ who is the prince of the power of the air (Eph. ii. but it was looked upon to be an immediate hand of God_ and a token of his wrath. So Bildad construed it (ch. viii. 4): Thy children have sinned against him_ and he has cast them away in their transgression. ,20250223
They died suddenly. Had they been taken away by some lingering disease_ he would have had notice to expect their death_ and prepare for the breach; but this came upon him without giving him any warning. ,20250223
They died when they were feasting and making merry. Had they died suddenly when they were praying_ he might the better have borne it. He would have hoped that death had found them in a good frame if their blood had been mingled with their feast_ where he himself used to be jealous of them that they had sinned_ and cursed God in their hearts—to have that day come upon them unawares_ like a thief in the night_ when perhaps their heads were overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness—this could not but add much to his grief_ considering what a tender concern he always had for his children's souls_ and that they were now out of the reach of the sacrifices he used to offer according to the number of them all. See how all things come alike to all. Job's children were constantly prayed for by their father_ and lived in love one with another_ and yet came to this untimely end. ,20250223
They dispossess them of their personal estates_ under colour of justice. They violently take away flocks_ pretending they are forfeited_ and feed thereof; as the rich man took the poor man's ewe lamb_ 2 Sam. xii,20250223
They do hurt with their riches_ which not only put them into a capacity of gratifying their own lusts and living luxuriously_ but give them an opportunity of oppressing others and dealing hardly with them. ,20250223
They do not profit the soul; they will not purchase any true comfort or happiness. They will stand a man in no stead at death_ or in the judgment of the great day; and the reason is because God casts away the substance of the wicked,20250223
They dread the knowledge of God_ and of his will_ and of their duty to him: We desire not the knowledge of thy ways. Those that are resolved not to walk in God's ways desire not to know them_ because their knowledge will be a continual reproach to their disobedience_ John iii. 19.,20250223
They dread the presence of God; they say unto him_ __Depart from us; let us never be troubled with the apprehension of our being under God's eye nor be restrained by the fear of him.__ Or they bid him depart as one they do not need_ nor have any occasion to make use of. The world is the portion they have chosen_ and take up with_ and think themselves happy in; while they have that they can live without God. Justly will God say Depart (Matt. xxv. 41) to those who have bidden him depart; and justly does he now take them at their word. ,20250223
They enquire concerning him_ __Wither has thy beloved gone? which may must we steer our course in pursuit of him?__ Note_ Those that are made acquainted with the excellencies of Christ_ and the comfort of an interest in him_ cannot but be inquisitive after him and desirous to know where they may meet with him. ,20250223
They expose themselves to correction: The fool's mouth does_ in effect_ call for strokes; he has said that which deserves to be punished with strokes_ and is still saying that which needs to be checked_ and restrained with strokes_ as Ananias unjustly commanded that Paul should be smitten on the mouth,20250223
They expose themselves to the wrath of God_ for he is angry at the voice of those that thus lie unto him with their mouth and flatter him with their tongue_ and is displeased at their dissimulation_ and destroys the works of their hands_ that is_ blasts their enterprises_ and defeats those purposes which_ when they made these vows_ they were seeking to God for the success of. If we treacherously cancel the words of our mouths_ and revoke our vows_ God will justly overthrow our projects_ and walk contrary_ and at all adventures_ with those that thus walk contrary_ and at all adventures with him. It is a snare to a man_ after vows_ to make enquiry.,20250223
They feasted in their own houses_ not in public houses_ where they would be more exposed to temptations_ and which were not so creditable. We do not find that Job himself feasted with them. Doubtless they invited him_ and he would have been the most welcome guest at any of their tables; nor was it from any sourness or moroseness of temper_ or for want of natural affection_ that he kept away_ but he was old and dead to these things_ like Barzillai (2 Sam. xix. and considered that the young people would be more free and pleasant if there were none but themselves. Yet he would not restrain his children from that diversion which he denied himself. Young people may be allowed a youthful liberty_ provided they flee youthful lusts.,20250223
They fill their heads with projects more than they understand_ so that their life is a constant toss of care and fear; but do not thou thus vex thyself: Cease from thy own wisdom; go on quietly in the way of thy business_ not contriving new ways and setting thy wits to work to find out new inventions. Acquiesce in God's wisdom_ and cease from thy own_ ch. iii. 5_ 6.,20250223
They give him the glory of his undertaking; to him is glory in the church_ Eph. iii,20250223
They go irresistibly and irrecoverably_ as an eagle toward heaven_ that flies strongly (there is no stopping her)_ and flies out of sight and out of call (there is no bringing her back); thus do riches leave men_ and leave them in grief and vexation if they set their hearts upon them.,20250223
They go on in their way with a holy security and serenity of mind_ as those that walk in the light. It is as the morning-light_ which shines out of obscurity (Isa. lviii. 8_ 10) and puts an end to the works of darkness. ,20250223
They had all promised him that he would be happy if he would take their advice. Now all this he looked upon as flattery_ and as designed to vex him so much the more. All this he calls their provocation_ v,20250223
They had been estranged from him_ and this was not the least of the grievances of his afflicted state; he bitterly complained of their unkindness_ ch. xix. 13_ &c. But now they visited him with all possible expressions of affection and respect. 1. They put honour upon him_ in coming to dine with him as formerly_ but (we may suppose) privately bringing their entertainment along with them_ so that he had the reputation of feasting them without the expense,20250223
They had looked shily upon the bride because she was black (ch. i. 6); but now they admire her_ and speak of her with great respect: Who is this? How beautiful she looks! Who would have expected such a comely and magnificent person to come out of the wilderness? As_ when Christ rode in triumph into Jerusalem_ they said_ Who is this? And of the accession of strangers to the church she herself says_ with wonder (Isa. xlix.,20250223
They had nothing at all in them to recommend them to any man's esteem. They were a vile kind; yea_ a kind without fame_ people that nobody could give a good word to nor had a good wish for; they were banished from the earth as being viler than the earth. One would not think it possible that ever the human nature should sink so low_ and degenerate so far_ as it did in these people. When we thank God that we are men we have reason to thank him that we are not such men. But such as these were abusive to Job_ ,20250223
They had reason to be ashamed of their hard-heartedness_ so ill becoming men_ of their uncharitableness_ so ill becoming good men_ and of their deceitfulness_ so ill becoming friends: but were they ashamed? No_ though they were told of it again and again_ yet they could not blush.,20250223
They hasten to utter ruin: They even hate their own souls_ for they wilfully do that which will be the inevitable destruction of them. See the absurdities sinners are guilty of; they love death_ than which nothing is more dreadful_ and hate their own souls_ than which nothing is more dear.,20250223
They hated to be told that which they could not bear to know. Secondly_ Religion could not rule them_ for they did not choose the fear of the Lord_ but chose to walk in the way of their heart and in the sight of their eyes. They were pressed to set God always before them_ but they chose rather to cast him and his fear behind their backs. Note_ Those who do not choose the fear of the Lord show that they have no knowledge.,20250223
They have a better relish of their enjoyments than the rich have. Hunger is the best sauce. Coarse fare_ with a good appetite to it has a sensible pleasantness in it_ which those are strangers to whose hearts are overcharged with surfeiting. Those that fare sumptuously every day nauseate even delicate food_ as the Israelites did the quails; whereas those that have no more than their necessary food_ though it be such as the full soul would call bitter_ to them it is sweet; they eat it with pleasure_ digest it_ and are refreshed by it,20250223
They have a spirit of contradiction to that which is good: They speak froward things; they say all they can against religion_ both to show their own enmity to it and to dissuade others from it. They are advocates for Satan; they plead for Baal_ and pervert the right ways of the Lord. How peevishly will profane wits argue for sin_ and with what frowardness will they carp at the word of God! Wisdom will keep us either from conversing with such men or at least from being ensnared by them. ,20250223
They have arts and engines to dry up the waters_ and carry them off_ when they break in upon them in their mines and threaten to drown the work_ v,20250223
They have clean hands_ kept clean from the gross pollutions of sin_ and_ when spotted with infirmities_ washed with innocency_ Ps. xxvi. 6.,20250223
They have no assurance of the continuance of it_ and yet take no thought to provide against the loss of it: Poverty shall come upon them_ and the riches which they made wings for_ that they might fly to them_ will make themselves wings to fly from them; but they are secure and improvident_ and do not consider this_ that while they are making haste to be rich they are really making haste to be poor_ else they would not trust to uncertain riches.,20250223
They have no breasts_ none yet fashioned (Ezek. xvi. no affection to Christ_ no principle of grace. The day will come when they shall be spoken for_ when the chosen shall be called_ shall be courted for Christ_ by the ministers_ the friends of the bridegroom. A blessed day it will be_ a day of visitation. What shall we do_ in that day_ to promote the match_ to conquer their coyness_ and persuade them to consent to Christ and present themselves chaste virgins to him? Note_ Those that through grace are brought to Christ themselves should contrive what they may do to help others to him_ to carry on the great design of his gospel_ which is to espouse souls to Christ and convert sinners to him from whom they have departed.,20250223
They have no excellency but that which death takes away_ and they die_ they die the second death_ for want of wisdom to lay hold on eternal life. Shall such a mean_ weak_ foolish_ sinful_ dying creature as this pretend to be more just than God and more pure than his Maker? No_ instead of quarrelling with his afflictions_ let him wonder that he is out of hell.,20250223
They have pumps_ and pipes_ and canals_ to clear their way_ and_ obstacles being removed_ they tread the path which no fowl knoweth (v. 7_ unseen by the vulture's eye_ which is piercing and quick-sighted_ and untrodden by the lion's whelps_ which traverse all the paths of the wilderness,20250223
They involve themselves in ruin: A fool's mouth_ which has been_ or would have been_ the destruction of others_ proves at length his own destruction_ perhaps from men. Shimei's mouth was his own destruction_ and Adonijah's_ who spoke against his own head. And when a fool_ by his foolish speaking_ has run himself into a premunire_ and thinks to bring himself off by justifying or excusing what he has said_ his defence proves his offence_ and his lips are still the snare of his soul_ entangling him yet more and more. However_ when men by their evil words shall be condemned at God's bar their mouths will be their destruction_ and it will be such an aggravation of their ruin as will not admit one drop of water_ one drop of comfort_ to cool their tongue_ which is their snare and will be their tormentor.,20250223
They kept a circular feast at some certain times (v. 4); they went and feasted in their houses. It was a comfort to this good man,20250223
They live_ and are not suddenly cut off by the strokes of divine vengeance. Those yet speak who have set their mouths against the heavens. Those yet act who have stretched out their hands against God. Not only they live (that is_ they are reprieved)_ but they live in prosperity_ 1 Sam. xxv,20250223
They looked unto him_ as well as I_ and were lightened. There thy mother brought thee forth_ the universal church_ or believing souls_ in whom Christ was formed_ Gal. iv,20250223
They made a collection among them for the repair of his losses and the setting of him up again. They did not think it enough to say_ Be warmed_ Be filled_ but gave him such things as would be of use to him_ Jam. ii,20250223
They made themselves strange to him_ were shy of him now that he was in his troubles_ and seemed as if they did not know him (ch. ii. were not free with him as they used to be when he was in his prosperity. Those are governed by the spirit of the world_ and not by any principles of true honour or love_ who make themselves strange to their friends_ or God's friends_ when they are in trouble. A friend loves at all times,20250223
They may be helped; they shall neither be despised nor despaired of. Our Saviour came_ not to call the righteous_ but sinners_ not the wise in their own eyes_ who say they see (John ix. but the simple_ those who are sensible of their simplicity and ashamed of it_ and him that is willing to become a fool_ that he may be wise_ 1 Cor.,20250223
They may expect to smart for it in this world: It brings the punishments of the sword. Wrath leads to such crimes as expose men to the sword of the magistrate. God himself often takes vengeance for it_ and those that showed no mercy shall find no mercy. ,20250223
They must always give judgment according to equity (v. 26); they must give a right answer_ that is_ give their opinion and pass sentence according to law and them true merits of the cause; and every one shall kiss his lips that does so_ that is_ shall love and honour him_ and be subject to his orders_ for there is a kiss of allegiance as well as of affection. He that in common conversation likewise speaks pertinently and with sincerity recommends himself to his company and is beloved and respected by all.,20250223
They must awake and arise from the dead; they must live_ not in pleasure (for those that do so are dead while they live)_ but in the service of God; for those only that do so live indeed_ live to some purpose. __Live not a mere animal-life_ as brutes_ but now_ at length_ live the life of men. Live and you shall live; live spiritually_ and you shall live eternally___ Eph. v,20250223
They must be left behind when we die_ ver. 15_ 16,20250223
They must break off from all bad company: __Forsake the foolish_ converse not with them_ conform not to their ways_ have no fellowship with the works of darkness_ or with those that deal in such works.__ The first step towards virtue is to shun vice_ and therefore to shun the vicious. Depart from me_ you evil-doers. ,20250223
They must choose the paths of Wisdom_ and keep to them: __Go in the way of understanding; govern thyself henceforward by the rules of religion and right reason.__ It is not enough to forsake the foolish_ but we must join ourselves with those that walk in wisdom_ and walk in the same spirit and steps.,20250223
They must discountenance and give check to all fraud_ violence_ injustice_ and immorality; and_ though thereby they may disoblige a particular person_ yet they will recommend themselves to the favour of God and man. Let magistrates and ministers_ and private persons too that are capable of doing it_ rebuke the wicked_ that they may bring them to repentance or put them to shame_ and they shall have the comfort of it in their own bosoms: To them shall be delight_ when their consciences witness for them that they have been witnesses for God; and a good blessing shall come upon them_ the blessing of God and good men; they shall be deemed religion's patrons and their country's patriots. See ch. xxviii. 23,20250223
They must grapple with subterraneous waters,20250223
They must never connive at or encourage wicked people in their wicked practices. Magistrates in their places_ and ministers in theirs_ are to deal faithfully and the wicked man_ though he be a great man or a particular friend_ to convict him of his wickedness_ to show him what will be in the end thereof_ to discover him to others_ that they may avoid him. But if those whose office it is thus to show people their transgressions palliate them and connive at them_ if they excuse the wicked man_ much more if they prefer him and associate with him (which is_ in effect_ to say_ Thou art righteous)_ they shall justly be looked upon as enemies to the public peace and welfare_ which they ought to advance_ and the people shall curse them and cry out shame on them; and even those of other nations shall abhor them_ as base betrayers of their trust,20250223
They not only do righteousness themselves_ but take care to employ those under them that do righteousness too_ which is of great consequence to the people_ who must be subject not only to the king as supreme_ but to the governors sent by him_ 1 Pet. ii,20250223
They not only estranged themselves from him_ but magnified themselves against him (v. not only looked shy of him_ but looked big upon him_ and insulted over him_ magnifying themselves to depress him. It is a mean thing_ it is a base thing_ thus to trample upon those that are down,20250223
They not only left off speaking themselves_ but they stood still_ to hear if any of the company would speak their minds_ so that (as we say) he had room and fair play given him. They seemed not fully satisfied themselves with what they had said_ else they would have adjourned the court_ and not have stood still_ expecting what might further be offered. And therefore I said (v.,20250223
They not only triumphed in his calamity_ but set it forward_ and did all they could to add to his miseries and make them more grievous to him. It is a great sin to forward the calamity of any_ especially of good people. In this they have no helper_ nobody to set them on or to countenance them in it_ nobody to bear them out or to protect them_ but they do it of their own accord; they are fools in other things_ but wise enough to do mischief_ and need no help in inventing that. Some read it thus_ They hold my heaviness a profit_ though they be never the better. Wicked people_ though they get nothing by the calamities of others_ yet rejoice in them.,20250223
They not only will not relieve the poor_ but they oppress them_ rob the spital_ extort from their poor tenants and neighbours_ invade the rights of those who have not wherewithal to defend themselves_ and then give bribes to the rich_ to protect and countenance them in it. But it is all in vain; they shall come to want. Those that rob God_ and so make him the enemy_ cannot secure themselves by giving to the rich_ to make them their friends.,20250223
They offer their service to the spouse to accompany her in quest of him: We will seek him with thee. Those that would find Christ must seek him_ seek him early_ seek him diligently; and it is best seeking Christ in concert_ to join with those that are seeking him. We must seek for communion with Christ in communion with saints. We know whither our beloved has gone; he has gone to heaven_ to his Father_ and our Father. He took care to send us notice of it_ that we might know how to direct to him_ John xx,20250223
They perish for ever because they regard not God and their duty; they consider not their latter end_ Lam. i,20250223
They perish; they are destroyed for lack of knowledge_ Hos. iv,20250223
They pleaded against him his reproach_ that is_ they made use of his affliction as an argument against him to prove him a wicked man. They should have pleaded for him his integrity_ and helped him to take the comfort of that under his affliction_ and so have pleaded that against his reproach (as St. Paul_ 2 Cor. i. 12); but_ instead of that_ they pleaded his reproach against his integrity_ which was not only unkind_ but very unjust; for where shall we find an honest man if reproach may be admitted for a plea against him?,20250223
They reproached him_ (v. gave him a bad character and laid to his charge things that he knew not. To an ingenuous mind reproach is a cutting thing,20250223
They rise with the light_ as soon as ever the day breaks_ to kill the poor travellers that are up early and abroad about their business_ going to market with a little money or goods; and though it is so little that they are really to be called poor and needy_ who with much ado get a sorry livelihood by their marketings_ yet_ to get it_ the murderer will both take his neighbour's life and venture his own_ will rather play at such small game than not play at all; nay_ he kills for killing sake_ thirsting more for blood than for booty. See what care and pains wicked men take to compass their wicked designs_ and let the sight shame us out of our negligence and slothfulness in doing good.,20250223
They seek death.,20250223
They seem to be under the special protection of the divine Providence; and one would wonder how they escape with life through so many dangers as they run themselves into,20250223
They shall be (that is_ they shall be to me) as clusters of the vine_ which make glad the heart. __Now that I come up to the palm-tree thy graces shall be exerted and excited.__ Christ's presence with his people kindles the holy heavenly fire in their souls_ and then their breasts shall be as clusters of the vine_ a cordial to themselves and acceptable to him. And since God_ at first_ breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life_ and breathes the breath of the new life still_ the smell of their nostrils is like the smell of apples_ or oranges_ which is pleasing and reviving. The Lord smelt a sweet savour from Noah's sacrifice_ Gen. viii,20250223
They shall be assured of peace_ and of the continuance and entail of it. __Thou shalt know_ to thy unspeakable satisfaction_ that peace is sure to thee and thine_ having the word of God for it.__ Providence may change_ but the promise cannot. ,20250223
They shall be safe now. Integrity and uprightness will preserve men_ will give them a holy security in the worst of times; for it will preserve their comfort_ their reputation_ and all their interests. They may be injured_ but they cannot be hurt,20250223
They shall be welcome. ,20250223
They shall die a sudden death_ die in youth_ when death is most a surprise_ and death (that is_ the consequence of it) is always such to hypocrites; as those that die in youth die when they hoped to live_ so hypocrites_ at death_ go to hell_ when they hoped to go to heaven. When a wicked man dies his expectations shall perish.,20250223
They shall die in the beginning of their days and never come to maturity. Many a man's family is ruined by his iniquity. Fourthly_ He is in care to enjoy it a great while himself; but in that also he is crossed. 1. He may perhaps be taken from it (v. 30): By the breath of God's mouth shall he go away_ and leave his wealth to others; that is_ by God's wrath_ which_ like a stream of brimstone_ kindles the fire that devours him (Isa. xxx. or by his word; he speaks_ and it is done immediately. This night thy soul shall be required of thee; and so the wicked is driven away in his wickedness_ the worldling in his worldliness,20250223
They shall die the second death. Their life_ after death (for so it comes in here)_ is among the unclean_ among the fornicators (so some)_ among the worst and vilest of sinners_ notwithstanding their specious and plausible profession. It is among the Sodomites (so the margin)_ those filthy wretches_ who going after strange flesh_ are set forth for an example_ suffering the vengeance of eternal fire_ Jude 7. The souls of the wicked live after death_ but they live among the unclean_ the unclean spirits_ the devil and his angels_ forever separated from the new Jerusalem_ into which no unclean thing shall enter.,20250223
They shall do good with it. The innocent shall not hoard the silver_ as he did that gathered it_ but shall divide it to the poor_ shall give a portion to seven and also to eight_ which is laying up the best securities. Money is like manure_ good for nothing if it be not spread. When God enriches good men they must remember they are but stewards and must give an account. What bad men bring a curse upon their families with the ill-getting of good men bring a blessing upon their families with the well-using of. He that by unjust gain increaseth his substance shall gather it for him that will pity the poor_ Prov. xxviii.,20250223
They shall have as much riches and honour as Infinite Wisdom sees good for them (v. 18); they are with Christ_ that is_ he has them to give_ and whether he will see fit to give them to us must be referred to him. Religion sometimes helps to make people rich and great in this world_ gains them a reputation_ and so increases their estates; and the riches which Wisdom gives to her favourites have these two advantages:— ,20250223
They shall have grace to manage the concerns of their families after a godly sort_ and not to sin in the management of them. They shall call their servants to account without passion_ pride_ covetousness_ worldliness_ or the like; they shall look into their affairs without discontent at what is or distrust of what shall be. Family piety crowns family peace and prosperity. The greatest blessing_ both in our employments and in our enjoyments_ is to be kept from sin in them. When we are abroad it is comfortable to hear that our tabernacle is in peace; and when we return home it is comfortable to visit our habitation with satisfaction in our success_ that we have not failed in our business_ and with a good conscience_ that we have not offended God.,20250223
They shall have it_ and divide it among themselves. In some way or other Providence shall so order it that good men shall come honestly by that wealth which the wicked man came dishonestly by. The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just_ Prov. xiii,20250223
They shall have that which is infinitely better_ if they have not riches and honour in this world (v. 19): __My fruit is better than gold_ and will turn to a better account_ will be of more value in less compass_ and my revenue better than the choicest silver_ will serve a better trade.__ We may assure ourselves that not only Wisdom's products at last_ but her income in the mean time_ not only her fruit_ but her revenue_ is more valuable than the best either of the possessions or of the reversions of this world.,20250223
They shall have wisdom to govern their families aright_ to order their affairs with discretion_ and to look well to the ways of their household_ which is here called visiting their habitation. Masters of families must not be strangers at home_ but must have a watchful eye over what they have and what their servants do.,20250223
They shall not avoid the evil which sometimes they frighten themselves with the apprehensions of. They shall not escape the execution of the sentence passed upon them_ can neither out-brave it nor outrun it. Those that will not fly to God will find it in vain to think of flying from him.,20250223
They shall see it_ that is_ observe it_ and take notice of it (Hos. xiv. 9); and they shall be glad_ not to see their fellow-creatures miserable_ or any secular turn of their own served_ or point gained_ but to see God glorified_ the word of God fulfilled_ the power of oppressors broken_ and thereby the oppressed relieved—to see sin shamed_ atheists and infidels confounded_ and fair warning given to all others to shun such wicked courses. Nay_ they shall laugh them to scorn_ that is_ they justly might do it_ they shall do it_ as God does it_ in a holy manner_ Ps. ii. 4; Prov. i,20250223
They shall take occasion thence to expose the folly of sinners and show how ridiculous their principles are_ though they call themselves wits. Lo_ this is the man that made not God his strength; and see what comes of it_ Ps. lii,20250223
They shame themselves; for they are forced to say before the angel_ It was an error_ that either they did not mean or did not consider what they said; and_ take it which way you will_ it is bad enough. __When thou hast made a vow_ do not seek to evade it_ nor find excuses to get clear of the obligation of it; say not before the priest_ who is called the angel or messenger of the Lord of hosts_ that_ upon second thoughts_ thou hast changed thy mind_ and desirest to be absolved from the obligation of thy vow; but stick to it_ and do not seek a hole to creep out at.__ Some by the angel understand the guardian angel which they suppose to attend every man and to inspect what he does. Others understand it of Christ_ the Angel of the covenant_ who is present with his people in their assemblies_ who searches the heart_ and cannot be imposed upon; provoke him not_ for God's name is in him_ and he is represented as strict and jealous_ Exod. xxiii. 20_ 21. ,20250223
They spoke not a word to him_ whatever they said one to another_ by way of instruction_ for the improvement of the present providence. They said nothing to that purport to which afterwards they said much—nothing to grieve him (ch. iv. because they saw his grief was very great already_ and they were loth at first to add affliction to the afflicted. There is a time to keep silence_ when either the wicked is before us_ and by speaking we may harden them (Ps. xxxix. 1)_ or when by speaking we may offend the generation of God's children_ Ps. lxxiii,20250223
They sympathized with him_ and showed a tender concern for him_ such as becomes brethren. They bemoaned him when they talked over all the calamities of his afflicted state_ and comforted him when they took notice of God's gracious returns to him. They wept for his griefs_ and rejoiced in his joys_ and proved not such miserable comforters as his three friends_ that_ at first_ were so forward and officious to attend him. These were not such great men nor such learned and eloquent men as those_ but they proved much more skilful and kind in comforting Job. God sometimes chooses the foolish and weak things of the world_ as for conviction_ so for comfort,20250223
They take a pleasure in sin_ both in committing it themselves and in seeing others commit it (v. 14): They rejoice in an opportunity to do evil_ and in the accomplishment and success of any wicked project. It is sport to fools to do mischief; nor is any sight more grateful to them than to see the frowardness of the wicked_ to see those that are hopeful drawn into the ways of sin_ and then to see them hardened and confirmed in those ways. They are pleased if they can discern that the devil's kingdom gets ground (see Rom. i. such a height of impiety have they arrived at. ,20250223
They take all occasions to offer personal abuses to them_ v,20250223
They take that advantage against and are oppressive to them. As the fatherless_ so the childless_ are in some degree helpless. For the same reason it is a cruel thing to hurt the widow_ to whom we ought to do good; and not doing good_ when it is in our power_ is doing hurt,20250223
They taught us_ not only that we might learn ourselves_ but that we might teach our children_ the good knowledge of God_ Ps. lxxviii,20250223
They thought themselves safe in their eldest brother's house_ but were far from safety_ for they were crushed in the gate. Perhaps the door or gate of the house was highest built_ and fell heaviest upon them_ and there was none to deliver them from perishing in the ruins. This is commonly understood of the destruction of the families of wicked men_ by the execution of justice upon them_ to oblige them to restore what they have ill-gotten. They leave it to their children; but the descent shall not bar the entry of the rightful owners_ who will crush their children_ and cast them by due course of law (and there shall be none to help them)_ or perhaps by oppression_ Ps. cix. 9_ &c. ,20250223
They took from him all that he had_ and made a full end of his enjoyments. The detail of his losses answers to the foregoing inventory of his possessions.,20250223
They took her for a lewd woman (because she went about the streets at that time of night_ when they were walking their rounds)_ and beat her accordingly. Disconsolate saints are taken for sinners_ and are censured and reproached as such. Thus Hannah_ when she was praying in the bitterness of her soul_ was wounded and smitten by Eli_ one of the prime watchmen_ when he said to her_ How long wilt thou be drunken? so counting her a daughter of Belial_ 1 Sam.,20250223
They took no more care about him than if he had been a stranger whom they never knew. His kinsfolk_ who claimed relation to him when he was in prosperity_ now failed him; they came short of their former professions of friendship to him and his present expectations of kindness from them. Even his familiar friends_ whom he was mindful of_ had now forgotten him_ had forgotten both his former friendliness to them and his present miseries: they had heard of his troubles_ and designed him a visit; but truly they forgot it_ so little affected were they with it. Nay_ his inward friends_ the men of his secret_ whom he was most intimate with and laid in his bosom_ not only forgot him_ but abhorred him_ kept as far off from him as they could_ because he was poor and could not entertain them as he used to do_ and because he was sore and a loathsome spectacle. Those whom he loved_ and who therefore were worse than publicans if they did not love him now that he was in distress_ not only turned from him_ but were turned against him_ and did all they could to make him odious_ so to justify themselves in being so strange to him_ v,20250223
They were driven forth from among men_ (they cried after them as after a thief;) 6 To dwell in the clifts of the valleys_ in caves of the earth_ and in the rocks. 7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together. 8 They were children of fools_ yea_ children of base men: they were viler than the earth. 9 And now am I their song_ yea_ I am their byword. 10 They abhor me_ they flee far from me_ and spare not to spit in my face. 11 Because he hath loosed my cord_ and afflicted me_ they have also let loose the bridle before me. 12 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet_ and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. 13 They mar my path_ they set forward my calamity_ they have no helper. 14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.,20250223
They were exhorted to submit to the government of right reason and religion_ but they rebelled against both. First_ Reason should not rule them_ for they hated knowledge (v. hated the light of divine truth because it discovered to them the evil of their deeds_ John iii,20250223
They were extremely poor_ v,20250223
They were good men_ and_ as soon as they understood what the mind of the Lord was_ they did as he commanded them_ and that speedily and without gainsaying_ though it was against the grain to flesh and blood to court him thus whom they had condemned. Note_ Those who would be reconciled to God must carefully use the prescribed means and methods of reconciliation. Peace with God is to be had only in his own way and upon his own terms_ and they will never seem hard to those who know how to value the privilege_ but they will be glad of it upon any terms_ though ever so humbling. Job's friends had all joined in accusing Job_ and now they join in begging his pardon. Those that have sinned together should repent together. Those that appeal to God_ as both Job and his friends had often done_ must resolve to stand by his award_ whether pleasing or unpleasing to their own mind. And those that conscientiously observe God's commands need not doubt of his favour: The Lord also accepted Job_ and his friends in answer to his prayer. It is not said_ He accepted them (though that is implied)_ but_ He accepted Job for them; so he has made us accepted in the beloved_ Eph. i. 6; Matt. iii,20250223
They were in love with their folly_ and would not be made wise. They were obstinate to all the methods that were taken to reclaim them. God stretched out his hand in mercies bestowed upon them_ and_ when those would not work upon them_ in corrections_ but all were in vain; they regarded the operations of his hand no more than the declarations of his mouth. ,20250223
They were in pain for the comfort of an interest in thee_ and travailed in pain with great sorrow (so the word here signifies); but they brought thee forth; the pangs did not continue always; those that had travailed in convictions at last brought forth in consolations_ and the pain was forgotten for joy of the Saviour's birth. By this very similitude our Saviour illustrates the joy which his disciples would have in his return to them_ after a mournful separation for a time_ John xvi. 21_ 22. After the bitter pangs of repentance many a one has had the blessed birth of comfort; why then may not I?,20250223
They were not ashamed of what they did_ v,20250223
They were not his judges (v. 4): __Is my complaint to man? No_ if it were I see it would be to little purpose to complain. But my complaint is to God_ and to him do I appeal. Let him be Judge between you and me. Before him we stand upon even terms_ and therefore I have the privilege of being heard as well as you. If my complaint were to men_ my spirit would be troubled_ for they would not regard me_ nor rightly understand me; but my complaint is to God_ who will suffer me to speak_ though you will not.__ It would be sad if God should deal as unkindly with us as our friends sometimes do. ,20250223
They were of a mean extraction. Their fathers were so very despicable that such a man as Job would have disdained to take them into the lowest service about his house_ as that of tending the sheep and attending the shepherds with the dogs of his flock_ v. 1. They were so shabby that they were not fit to be seen among his servants_ so silly that they were not fit to be employed_ and so false that they were not fit to be trusted in the meanest post. Job here speaks of what he might have done_ not of what he did: he was not of such a spirit as to set any of the children of men with the dogs of his flock; he knew the dignity of human nature better than to do so,20250223
They were ready to starve_ for they would not dig_ and to beg they were ashamed. Had they been brought to necessity by the providence of God_ their neighbours would have sought them out as proper objects of charity and would have relieved them; but_ being brought into straits by their own slothfulness and wastefulness_ nobody was forward to relieve them. Hence they were forced to flee into the deserts both for shelter and sustenance_ and were put to sorry shifts indeed_ when they cut up mallows by the bushes_ and were glad to eat them_ for want of food that was fit for them_ v,20250223
They were rebels to God: They turned back from him_ cast off the fear of him_ and abandoned the very thoughts of him; for they would not consider any of his ways_ took no heed either to his precepts or to his providences_ but lived without God in the world. This is at the bottom of all the wickedness of the wicked_ they turn back from God; and it is because they do not consider_ not because they cannot_ but because they will not. From inconsideration comes impiety_ and thence all immorality. ,20250223
They were such lying_ thieving_ lurking_ mischievous people_ that the best service the magistrates could do was to rid the country of them_ while the very mob cried after them as after a thief. Away with such fellows from the earth; it is not fit they should live. They were lazy and would not work_ and therefore they were exclaimed against as thieves_ and justly; for those that do not earn their own bread by honest labour do_ in effect_ steal the bread out of other people's mouths. An idle fellow is a public nuisance; but it is better to drive such into a workhouse than_ as here_ into a wilderness_ which will punish them indeed_ but never reform them. They were forced to dwell in caves of the earth_ and they brayed like asses among the bushes_ v. 6_ 7. See what is the lot of those that have the cry of the country_ the cry of their own conscience_ against them; they cannot but be in a continual terror and confusion. They groan among the trees (so Broughton) and smart among the nettles; they are stung and scratched there_ where they hoped to be sheltered and protected. See what miseries wicked people bring themselves to in this world; yet this is nothing to what is in reserve for them in the other world,20250223
They were taken away when he had most need of them to comfort him under all his other losses. Such miserable comforters are all creatures. In God only we have a present help at all times.,20250223
They were tyrants to all mankind_,20250223
They were unanimous in singing God's praises; they sang together with one accord_ and there was no jar in their harmony. The sweetest concerts are in praising God. ,20250223
They were under those mountains_ I say— whence vain repetitions are called Battologies_ Matt. vi. 7.,20250223
They were very scandalous wicked people_ not only the burdens_ but the plagues_ of the places where they lived_ arrant scoundrels_ the scum of the country: They were driven forth from among men_ v,20250223
They will be constant preservatives from the temptations of Satan. Those that follow the dictates of this law will keep at a distance from the snares of sin_ and so escape the snares of death which those run into that forsake the law of the wise.,20250223
They will be constant springs of comfort and satisfaction_ as a fountain of life_ sending forth streams of living water; the closer we keep to those rules the more effectually we secure our own peace,20250223
They will meet with destruction they do not expect. While they are seeking wealth by such unlawful practices they are really seeking death; they lay themselves open to the envy and ill-will of men by the treasures they get_ and to the wrath and curse of God_ by the lying tongue wherewith they get them_ which he will make to fall upon themselves and sink them to hell.,20250223
They will mislead them if they can when they meet them on the high-way_ so that the poor and needy are forced to hide themselves from them_ having no other way to secure themselves from them. They love in their hearts to banter people_ and to make fools of them_ and do them a mischief if they can_ especially to triumph over poor people_ whom they turn out of the way of getting relief_ threaten to punish them as vagabonds_ and so force them to abscond_ and laugh at them when they have done. Some understand those barbarous actions,20250223
They will not believe it is their duty to be religious: What is the Almighty_ that we should serve him? Like Pharaoh (Exod. v.,20250223
They will not believe it is their interest to be religious: What profit shall we have if we pray unto him? All the world are for what they can get_ and therefore wisdom's merchandise is neglected_ because they think there is nothing to be got by it. It is vain to serve God_ Mal. iii. 13_ 14. Praying will not pay debts nor portion children; nay_ perhaps serious godliness may hinder a man's preferment and expose him to losses; and what then? Is nothing to be called gain but the wealth and honour of this world? If we obtain the favour of God_ and spiritual and eternal blessings_ we have no reason to complain of losing by our religion. But_ if we have not profit by prayer_ it is our own fault (Isa.,20250223
They will not call upon God for themselves; but they cause the cry of the poor to come to him_ and that cry is against them. They are injurious and oppressive to the poor_ wrong them_ crush them_ impoverish them yet more_ and add affliction to the afflicted_ who cry unto God_ make their complaint to him_ and he hears them and pleads their cause. Their case is bad who have the prayers and tears of the poor against them; for the cry of the oppressed will_ sooner or later_ draw down vengeance on the heads of the oppressors_ and no one can say that this is more than right_ Exod.,20250223
They will not meet with the satisfaction they expect. It is a vanity tossed to and fro; it will be disappointment and vexation of spirit to them; they will not have the comfort of it_ nor can they put any confidence in it_ but will be perpetually uneasy. It will be tossed to and fro by their own consciences_ and by the censures of men; let them expect to be in a constant hurry,20250223
They will shortly be dead men. They make a mighty noise and bustle while they live_ but after awhile_ they go to the dead_ and there is an end of all their pomp and power; they will then be reckoned with for all their madness and outrage in sin. Though_ on this side death_ the righteous and the wicked seem alike_ on the other side death there will be a vast difference between them.,20250223
They will teach thee_ and inform thee (v. that all along_ in their time_ the judgments of God followed wicked men. This they will utter out of their hearts_ that is_ as that which they firmly believe themselves_ which they are greatly affected with and desirous to acquaint and affect others with.__ Note_ ,20250223
They would gladly be hid even by the shadow of death_ be hid in the grave_ and lie for ever there_ rather than appear before the judgment-seat of Christ. ,20250223
They would hereby be animated_ ,20250223
They would meet with others_ who are wise_ and good_ and just; thanks be to God_ all are not scorners. We meet with some who are so wise for themselves_ to just to themselves_ as to be willing and glad to be taught; and when we meet with such_ ,20250223
They would meet with some scorners and wicked men who would mock the messengers of the Lord_ and misuse them_ would laugh those to scorn that invite them to the feast of the Lord_ as they did_ 2 Chron. xxx. 10_ would treat them spitefully_ Matt. xxii,20250223
Thine head upon thee is like Carmel_ and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries. 6 How fair and how pleasant art thou_ O love_ for delights! 7 This thy stature is like to a palm tree_ and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. 8 I said_ I will go up to the palm tree_ I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine_ and the smell of thy nose like apples,20250223
Third Address of Eliphaz. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
This Elihu gathers as Job's opinion_ by an innuendo from what he said (ch. ix.,20250223
This Job must do_ and_ for the doing of it_ must prepare his heart. Job had prayed_ but Zophar would have him to pray in a better manner_ not as an appellant_ but as a petitioner and humble suppliant,20250223
This agrees with 1 Cor. ii. 11_ What man knows the things of a man_ and the changes of his temper_ save the spirit of a man? 1. Every man feels most from his own burden_ especially that which is a burden upon the spirits_ for that is commonly concealed and the sufferer keeps it to himself. We must not censure the griefs of others_ for we know not what they feel; their stroke perhaps is heavier than their groaning,20250223
This agrees with that ancient law_ Whoso sheddeth man's blood_ by man shall his blood be shed (Gen. ix. and proclaims,20250223
This agrees with what Christ said more than once,20250223
This also we had before_ ch. xx,20250223
This and the following chapter are an appendix to Solomon's proverbs; but they are both expressly called prophecies in the first verses of both_ by which it appears that the penmen of them_ whoever they were_ were divinely inspired. This chapter was penned by one that bears the name of __Agur Ben Jakeh.__ What tribe he was of_ or when he lived_ we are not told; what he wrote_ being indited by the Holy Ghost_ is here kept upon record. We have here_,20250223
This babe being made unruly and dangerous by the sin of man_ which was the original of all unquietness and danger in this lower world_ there is also a prison provided for it; bars and doors are set_ v,20250223
This bespeaks his stability and stedfastness; where he sets his foot he will fix it; he is able to bear all the weight of the government that is upon his shoulders_ and his legs will never fail under him. This sets forth the stateliness and magnificence of the goings of our God_ our King_ in his sanctuary (Ps. lxviii. and the steadiness and evenness of all his dispensations towards his people. The ways of the Lord are equal; they are all mercy and truth; these are the pillars of marble_ more lasting than the pillars of heaven. ,20250223
This bespeaks man's meanness and inferiority. How much below the inhabitants of yonder elevated and refined regions is he situated! It also bespeaks God's mercy to him. He is yet upon the earth_ not under it; on earth_ not in hell. Our time on earth is limited and short_ according to the narrow bounds of this earth; but heaven cannot be measured_ nor the days of heaven numbered,20250223
This bird is here taken notice of for her flight_ which is swift and strong_ and especially for the course she steers towards the south_ whither she follows the sun in winter_ out of the colder countries in the north_ especially when she is to cast her plumes and renew them. This is her wisdom_ and it was God that gave her this wisdom_ not man. Perhaps the extraordinary wisdom of the hawk's flight after her prey was not used then for men's diversion and recreation_ as it has been since. It is a pity that the reclaimed hawk_ which is taught to fly at man's command and to make him sport_ should at any time be abused to the dishonour of God_ since it is from God that she receives that wisdom which makes her flight entertaining and serviceable,20250223
This book of Job stands by itself_ is not connected with any other_ and is therefore to be considered alone. Many copies of the Hebrew Bible place it after the book of Psalms_ and some after the Proverbs_ which perhaps has given occasion to some learned men to imagine it to have been written by Isaiah or some of the later prophets. But_ as the subject appears to have been much more ancient_ so we have no reason to think but that the composition of the book was_ and that therefore it is most fitly placed first in this collection of divine morals: also_ being doctrinal_ it is proper to precede and introduce the book of Psalms_ which is devotional_ and the book of Proverbs_ which is practical; for how shall we worship or obey a God whom we know not? As to this book_,20250223
This caution is introduced with a solemn preface: __Hear me now therefore_ O you children! whoever you are that read or hear these lines_ take notice of what I say_ and mix faith with it_ treasure it up_ and depart not from the words of my mouth_ as those will do that hearken to the words of the strange woman. Do not only receive what I say_ for the present merely_ but cleave to it_ and let it be ready to thee_ and of force with thee_ when thou art most violently assaulted by the temptation.__,20250223
This caution is the same with that which is so much insisted on_ Ps. xxxvii. __Envy not the oppressor; though he be rich and great_ though he live in ease and pleasure_ and make all about him to stand in awe of him_ yet do not think him a happy man_ nor wish thyself in his condition. Choose none of his ways; do not imitate him_ nor take the courses he takes to enrich himself. Never think of doing as he does_ though thou wert sure to get by it all that he has_ for it would be dearly bought.__ Now_ to show what little reason saints have to envy sinners_ Solomon here_ in the last four verses of the chapter_ compares the condition of sinners and saints together (as his father David had done_ Ps. xxxvii.)_ sets the one over against the other_ that we may see how happy the saints are_ though they be oppressed_ and how miserable the wicked are_ though they be oppressors. Men are to be judged of as they stand with God_ and as he judges of them_ not as they stand in the world's books. Those are in the right who are of God's mind; and_ if we be of his mind_ we shall see_ whatever pretence one sinner may have to envy another_ that saints are so happy themselves that they have no reason at all to envy any sinner_ though his condition be ever so prosperous. For,20250223
This chapter begins Job's reply to Eliphaz. In this reply he takes no notice of his friends_ either because he saw it was to no purpose or because he liked the good counsel Eliphaz gave him in the close of his discourse so well that he would make no answer to the peevish reflections he began with; but he appeals to God_ begs to have his cause heard_ and doubts not but to make it good_ having the testimony of his own conscience concerning his integrity. Here seems to be a struggle between flesh and spirit_ fear and faith_ throughout this chapter.,20250223
This chapter begins Job's reply to that discourse of Eliphaz which we had in the foregoing chapter; it is but the second part of the same song of lamentation with which he had before bemoaned himself_ and is set to the same melancholy tune.,20250223
This chapter is Job's answer to Bildad's discourse in the foregoing chapter. Though his spirit was grieved and much heated_ and Bildad was very peevish_ yet he gave him leave to say all he designed to say_ and did not break in upon him in the midst of his argument; but_ when he had done_ he gave him a fair answer_ in which_,20250223
This chapter is added to Solomon's proverbs_ some think because it is of the same author_ supposing king Lemuel to be king Solomon; others only because it is of the same nature_ though left in writing by another author_ called Lemuel; however it be_ it is a prophecy_ and therefore given by inspiration and direction of God_ which Lemuel was under in the writing of it_ and putting it into this form_ as his mother was in dictating to him the matter of it. Here is_,20250223
This chapter is one of the most excellent in all this book_ both for argument to persuade us to be religious and for directions therein.,20250223
This chapter is proper for funeral solemnities; and serious meditations on it will help us both to get good by the death of others and to get ready for our own.,20250223
This chapter seems to be like Solomon's proverbs_ a collection of wise sayings and observations_ rather than a part of his sermon; but the preacher studied to be sententious_ and __set in order many proverbs___ to be brought in in his preaching. Yet the general scope of all the observations in this chapter is to recommend wisdom to us_ and its precepts and rules_ as of great use for the right ordering of our conversation and to caution us against folly.,20250223
This comforted the prophet_ Jer. xii,20250223
This confirms what was said (v. 3) concerning God's omnipresence_ in order to his judging of evil and good. 1. God knows all things_ even those things that are hidden from the eyes of all living: Hell and destruction are before the Lord_ not only the centre of the earth_ and its subterraneous caverns_ but the grave_ and all the dead bodies which are there buried out of our sight; they are all before the Lord_ all under his eye_ so that none of them can be lost or be to seek when they are to be raised again. He knows where every man lies buried_ even Moses_ even those that are buried in the greatest obscurity; nor needs he any monument with a Hic jacet—Here he lies_ to direct him. The place of the damned in particular_ and all their torments_ which are inexpressible_ the state of separate souls in general_ and all their circumstances_ are under God's eye. The word here used for destruction is Abaddon_ which is one of the devil's names_ Rev. ix,20250223
This covetous worldling_ that is so bent upon raising an estate_ all his days eats in darkness and much sorrow_ and it is his sickness and wrath; he has not only no pleasure of his estate_ nor any enjoyment of it himself_ for he eats the bread of sorrow (Ps. cxxvii.,20250223
This description of the virtuous woman is designed to show what wives the women should make and what wives the men should choose; it consists of twenty-two verses_ each beginning with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet in order_ as some of the Psalms_ which makes some think it was no part of the lesson which Lemuel's mother taught him_ but a poem by itself_ written by some other hand_ and perhaps had been commonly repeated among the pious Jews_ for the ease of which it was made alphabetical. We have the abridgment of it in the New Testament (1 Tim. ii. 9_ 10,20250223
This does not condemn all long prayers; were they not good_ the Pharisees would not have used them for a pretence; Christ prayed all night; and we are directed to continue in prayer. But it condemns careless heartless praying_ vain repetitions (Matt. vi. repeating Pater-nosters by tale. Let us speak to God_ and of him_ in his own words_ words which the scripture teaches; and let our words_ words of our own invention_ be few_ lest_ not speaking by rule_ we speak amiss. ,20250223
This does not so much commend our services as God's gracious condescension in making the best of them_ and the efficacy of the much incense which is offered with the prayers of saints_ Rev. viii,20250223
This expresses not only the innate contrariety that there is between virtue and vice_ as between light and darkness_ fire and water_ but the old enmity that has always been between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent_ Gen. iii,20250223
This expresses that very emphatically which many wise and good men feel very sensibly_ what a grievous vexatious thing it is to have a foolish wicked child. See here,20250223
This gives us a touchstone by which we may try ourselves. Silver and gold are tried by putting them into the furnace and fining-pot; so is man tried by praising him. Let him be extolled and preferred_ and then he will show himself what he is. 1. If a man be made_ by the applause that is given him_ proud_ conceited_ and scornful_—if he take the glory to himself which he should transmit to God_ as Herod did_—if_ the more he is praised_ the more careless he is of what he says and does_—if he lie in bed till noon because his name is up_ thereby it will appear that he is a vain foolish man_ and a man who_ though he be praised_ has nothing in him truly praise-worthy,20250223
This he begs in the most moving melting language that could be_ enough (one would think) to break a heart of stone: __Have pity upon me_ have pity upon me_ O you my friends! if you will do nothing else for me_ be sorry for me_ and show some concern for me; have pity upon me_ for the hand of God hath touched me. My case is sad indeed_ for I have fallen into the hands of the living God_ my spirit is touched with the sense of his wrath_ a calamity of all other the most piteous.__ Note_ It becomes friends to pity one another when they are in trouble_ and not to shut up the bowels of compassion,20250223
This he illustrates by comparing the corruption of his own heart and life with the corruption of the world_ where he scarcely found one good man among a thousand; nay_ among all the thousand wives and concubines which he had_ he did not find one good woman. __Even so___ says he_ __When I come to recollect and review my own thoughts_ words_ and actions_ and all the passages of my life past_ perhaps among those that were manly I might find one good among a thousand_ and that was all; the rest even of those had some corruption or other in them.__ He found (v. 20) that he had sinned even in doing good. But for those that were effeminate_ that passed in the indulgence of his pleasures_ they were all naught; in that part of his life there did not appear so much as one of a thousand good. In our hearts and lives there appears little good_ at the best_ but sometimes none at all. Doubtless this is not intended as a censure of the female sex in general; it is probable that there have been and are more good women than good men (Acts xvii. 4_ 12); he merely alludes to his own sad experience. And perhaps there may be this further in it: he does_ in his proverbs_ warn us against the snares both of the evil man and of the strange woman (Prov. ii. 12_ 16; iv. 14; v. 3); now he had observed the ways of the evil women to be more deceitful and dangerous than those of the evil men_ that it was more difficult to discover their frauds and elude their snares_ and therefore he compares sin to an adulteress (Prov. ix. and perceives he can no more find out the deceitfulness of his own heart than he can that of a strange woman_ whose ways are movable_ that thou canst not know them. ,20250223
This he repeated and echoed as the arrow that stuck fast in him: __I am the fool that has darkened counsel.__ There was some colour to have turned it upon Elihu_ as if God meant him_ for he spoke last_ and was speaking when the whirlwind began; but Job applied it to himself_ as it becomes us to do when faithful reproofs are given_ and not (as most do) to billet them upon other people. ,20250223
This includes also his edifying others and communicating grace to them_ which adds much to a Christian's beauty.,20250223
This intimates,20250223
This intimates a work of the Spirit upon her soul_ by which she was unwilling made willing_ Ps. cx,20250223
This intimates both the pleasure and the advantage of conversation. One man is nobody; nor will poring upon a book in a corner accomplish a man as the reading and studying of men will. Wise and profitable discourse sharpens men's wits; and those that have ever so much knowledge may by conference have something added to them. It sharpens men's looks_ and_ by cheering the spirits_ puts a briskness and liveliness into the countenance_ and gives a man such an air as shows he is pleased himself and makes him pleasing to those about him. Good men's graces are sharpened by converse with those that are good_ and bad men's lusts and passions are sharpened by converse with those that are bad_ as iron is sharpened by its like_ especially by the file. Men are filed_ made smooth_ and bright_ and fit for business (who were rough_ and dull_ and inactive)_ by conversation. This is designed,20250223
This intimates that_as long as we are here in this world_ we must expect a succession of troubles_ that the clouds will return after the rain. After six troubles may come a seventh; after many_ look for more; but out of them all will God deliver those that are his_ 2 Tim. iii. 11; Ps. xxxiv.,20250223
This intimates the strength of those bonds by which we are bound to each other and which we ought to be sensible of. 1. Friends must be constant to each other at all times. That is not true friendship which is not constant; it will be so if it be sincere_ and actuated by a good principle. Those that are fanciful or selfish in their friendship will love no longer than their humour is pleased and their interest served_ and therefore their affections turn with the wind and change with the weather. Swallow-friends_ that fly to you in summer_ but are gone in winter; such friends there is no loss of. But if the friendship be prudent_ generous_ and cordial_ if I love my friend because he is wise_ and virtuous_ and good_ as long as he continues so_ though he fall into poverty and disgrace_ still I shall love him. Christ is a friend that loves at all times (John xiii. 1) and we must so love him_ Rom. viii. 35,20250223
This is Job's reply to Zophar's discourse_ in which he complains less of his own miseries than he had done in his former discourses (finding that his friends were not moved by his complaints to pity him in the least)_ and comes closer to the general question that was in dispute between him and them_ Whether outward prosperity_ and the continuance of it_ were a mark of the true church and the true members of it_ so that the ruin of a man's prosperity is sufficient to prove him a hypocrite_ though no other evidence appear against him: this they asserted_ but Job denied.,20250223
This is Job's short reply to Bildad's short discourse_ in which he is so far from contradicting him that he confirms what he had said_ and out-does him in magnifying God and setting forth his power_ to show what reason he had still to say_ as he did (ch. xiii.,20250223
This is a challenge to all the powers of hell and earth to disquiet those to whom God speaks peace_ and for whom he creates it. If God give outward peace to a nation_ he can secure what he gives_ and disable the enemies of it to give it any disturbance. If God give inward peace to a man only_ the quietness and everlasting assurance which are the effect of righteousness_ neither the accusations of Satan nor the afflictions of this present time_ no_ nor the arrests of death itself_ can give trouble. What can make those uneasy whose souls dwell at ease in God? See Phil.,20250223
This is a good caution to those that have had a good education to take heed of hearkening to those who_ under pretence of instructing them_ draw them off from those good principles under the influence of which they were trained up. Observe,20250223
This is a great comfort to God's children_ under their afflictions_ ,20250223
This is a noble discourse of Job's concerning the wisdom_ power_ and sovereignty of God_ in ordering and disposing of all the affairs of the children of men_ according to the counsel of his own will_ which none dares gainsay or can resist. Take both him and them out of the controversy in which they were so warmly engaged_ and they all spoke admirably well; but_ in that_ we sometimes scarcely know what to make of them. It were well if wise and good men_ that differ in their apprehensions about minor things_ would see it to be for their honour and comfort_ and the edification of others_ to dwell most upon those great things in which they are agreed. On this subject Job speaks like himself. Here are no passionate complaints_ no peevish reflections_ but every thing masculine and great.,20250223
This is a paradox which the children of this world cannot understand and will not subscribe to_ that it is better to be poor and humble than to be rich and proud. 1. Those that divide the spoil are commonly proud; they value themselves and despise others_ and their mind rises with their condition; those therefore that are rich in this world have need to be charged that they be not high-minded_ 1 Tim. vi,20250223
This is a reason of what was said in the foregoing verse. 1. The sacrifices of the wicked are an abomination to God_ not for want of some nice points of ceremony_ but because their way_ the whole course and tenour of their conversation_ is wicked_ and consequently an abomination to him. Sacrifices for sin were not accepted of those that resolved to go on in sin_ and were to the highest degree abominable if intended to obtain a connivance at sin and a permission to go on in it,20250223
This is a remarkable instance of the extent of the divine providence to things that seem minute_ as this of the exact number of a man's cattle_ as also of the harmony of providence_ and the reference of one event to another; for known unto God are all his works_ from the beginning to the end. Job's other possessions_ no doubt_ were increased in proportion to his cattle_ lands_ money_ servants_ &c. So that if_ before_ he was the greatest of all the men of the east_ what was he now?,20250223
This is a rule of prudence in the management of household affairs; for all good men should be good husbands_ and manage with discretion_ which would prevent a great deal of sin_ and trouble_ and disgrace to their profession. 1. We must prefer necessaries before conveniences_ and not lay that out for show which should be expended for the support of the family. We must be contented with a mean cottage for a habitation_ rather than want_ or go in debt for_ food convenient,20250223
This is adding drunkenness to thirst_ and following strong drink; those that do so may read their doom Deut. xxix. 19_ 20_ their woe Isa. v. 11_ and_ if this be the end of the sin_ with good reason were we directed to stop at the beginning of it: Look not upon the wine when it is red.,20250223
This is an evidence that our strength is small_ and is a means of weakening it more. __It is a sign that thou art not a man of any resolution_ any firmness of thought_ any consideration_ any faith (for that is the strength of a soul)_ if thou canst not bear up under an afflictive change of thy condition.__ Some are so feeble that they can bear nothing; if a trouble does but touch them (Job iv. nay_ if it does but threaten them_ they faint immediately and are ready to give up all for gone; and by this means they render themselves unfit to grapple with their trouble and unable to help themselves. Be of good courage therefore_ and God shall strengthen thy heart.,20250223
This is applicable to spiritual charity_ our pious endeavours for the good of the souls of others; let us continue them_ for_ though we have long laboured in vain_ we may at length see the success of them. Let ministers_ in the days of their seedness_ sow both morning and evening; for who can tell which shall prosper?,20250223
This is commonly made light of by untoward children; they say_ __It is no transgression_ for it will be our own shortly_ our parents can well enough spare it_ we have occasion for it_ we cannot live as gentlemen upon the allowance our parents give us_ it is too strait for us.__ With such excuses as these they endeavour to shift off the conviction. But_ 2. How lightly soever an ungoverned youth makes of it_ it is really a very great sin; he that does it is the companion of a destroyer_ no better than a robber on the highway. What wickedness will he scruple to commit who will rob his own parents?,20250223
This is designed to encourage diligence_ faithfulness_ and constancy_ even in mean employments. Though the calling be laborious and despicable_ yet those who keep to it will find there is something to be got by it. 1. Let not a poor gardener_ who keeps the fig-tree_ be discouraged; though it require constant care and attendance to nurse up fig-trees_ and_ when they have grown to maturity_ to keep them in good order_ and gather the figs in their season_ yet he shall be paid for his pains: He shall eat the fruit of it_ 1 Cor. ix. 7,20250223
This is designed to engage us to diligence_ and quicken us_ what our hand finds to do_ to do it with all our might_ both in our worldly business and in the work of religion; for in the original it is_ The soul that labours labours for itself. It is heart-work which is here intended_ the labour of the soul_ which is here recommended to us,20250223
This is designed to rectify men's mistakes concerning strife. 1. Men think it is their wisdom to engage in quarrels; whereas it is the greatest folly that can be. He thinks himself a wise man that is quick in resenting affronts_ that stands upon every nicety of honour and right_ and will not abate an ace of either_ that prescribes_ and imposes_ and gives law_ to every body; but he that thus meddles is a fool_ and creates a great deal of needless vexation to himself,20250223
This is designed to warn all young men against the lusts of uncleanness. As they regard the welfare of their souls_ let them take heed of strange women_ lewd women_ whom they ought to be strange to_ of the mouth of strange women_ of the kisses of their lips (ch. vii. of the words of their lips_ their charms and enticements. Dread them; have nothing to do with them; for,20250223
This is essential to religion. We must first cease to do evil_ or we shall never learn to do well. Virtus est vitium fugere—Even in our flight from vice some virtue lies,20250223
This is gathered from ch. ix. 30_ 31. Though I make my hands ever so clean_ what the nearer am I? Thou shalt plunge me in the ditch. And ch. x. 15_ If I be wicked_ woe to me; but_ if I be righteous_ it is all the same. The psalmist_ when he compared his own afflictions with the prosperity of the wicked_ was tempted to say_ Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain_ Ps. lxxiii,20250223
This is generally applied to the grace of faith_ by which we are united to Christ_ as the body is united to the head by the neck; this is like the tower of David_ furnishing us with weapons of war_ especially bucklers and shields_ as the soldiers were supplied with them out of that tower_ for faith is our shield (Eph. vi. 16): those that have it never want a buckler_ for God will compass them with his favour as with a shield. When this neck is like a tower_ straight_ and stately_ and strong_ a Christian goes on in his way_ and works with courage and magnanimity_ and does not hang a drooping head_ and he does when faith fails. Some make the shields of the mighty men_ that are here said to hang up in the tower of David_ to be the monuments of the valour of David's worthies. Their shields were preserved_ to keep in remembrance them and their heroic acts_ intimating that it is a great encouragement to the saints to hold up their heads_ to see what great things the saints in all ages have accomplished and won by faith. In Heb. xi. we have the shields of the mighty men hung up_ the exploits of believers and the trophies of their victories.,20250223
This is generally taken for such a sure indication of wisdom that a fool may gain the reputation of being a wise man if he have but wit enough to hold his tongue_ to hear_ and see_ and say little. If a fool hold his peace_ men of candour will think him wise_ because nothing appears to the contrary_ and because it will be thought that he is making observations on what others say_ and gaining experience_ and is consulting with himself what he shall say_ that he may speak pertinently. See how easy it is to gain men's good opinion and to impose upon them. But when a fool holds his peace God knows his heart_ and the folly that is bound up there; thoughts are words to him_ and therefore he cannot be deceived in his judgment of men.,20250223
This is here undertaken to be done by the concurring power of the three persons in the Godhead: We will do it; like that (Gen. i.,20250223
This is in the habitation_ or cottage_ of the wise; and it is better to have an old-fashioned house_ and have it well furnished_ than a fine modern one_ with sorry housekeeping. God blesses the endeavors of the wise and then their houses are replenished,20250223
This is made a terror to evil-doers. Nothing is more comfortable to mankind than the light of the morning; it is pleasant to the eyes_ it is serviceable to life and the business of it_ and the favour of it is universally extended_ for it takes hold of the ends of the earth (v. and we should dwell_ in our hymns to the light_ on its advantages to the earth. But God here observes how unwelcome it is to those that do evil_ and therefore hate the light. God makes the light a minister of his justice as well as of his mercy. It is designed to shake the wicked out of the earth_ and for that purpose it takes hold of the ends of it_ as we take hold of the ends of a garment to shake the dust and moths out of it. Job had observed what a terror the morning light is to criminals_ because it discovers them (ch. xxiv. 13_ &c.)_ and God here seconds the observation_ and asks him whether the world was indebted to him for that kindness? No_ the great Judge of the world sends forth the beams of the morning light as his messengers to detect criminals_ that they may not only be defeated in their purposes and put to shame_ but that they may be brought to condign punishment (v. that their light may be withholden from them (that is_ that they may lose their comfort_ their confidence_ their liberties_ their lives) and that their high arm_ which they have lifted up against God and man_ may be broken_ and they deprived of their power to do mischief. Whether what is here said of the morning light was designed to represent_ as in a figure_ the light of the gospel of Christ_ and to give a type of it_ I will not say; but I am sure it may serve to put us in mind of the encomiums given to the gospel just at the rising of its morning-star by Zecharias in his Benedictus (Luke i. 78_ By the tender mercy of our God the day-spring from on high has visited us_ to give light to those that sit in darkness_ whose hearts are turned to it as clay to the seal_ 2 Cor. iv. and by the virgin Mary in her Magnificat (Luke i. showing that God_ in his gospel_ has shown strength with his arm_ scattered the proud_ and put down the mighty_ by that light by which he designed to shake the wicked_ to shake wickedness itself out of the earth_ and break its high arm.,20250223
This is no new thing_ but it has been the way of all that have been before them; there have been instances of this in every age: even Samuel and David could not always please,20250223
This is not always the consequence of a sick man's repentance and return to God_ but sometimes it is; and recovery from sickness is a mercy indeed when it arises from the remission of sin; then it is in love to the soul that the body is delivered from the pit of corruption when God casts our sins behind his back_ Isa. xxxviii,20250223
This is repeated (v. 30): __They would none of my counsel_ but rejected it with disdain; they called reproofs reproaches_ and took them as an insult (Jer. vi. 10); nay_ they despised all my reproof_ as if it were all a jest_ and not worth taking notice of.__ Note_ Those are marked for ruin that are deaf to reproof and good counsel. ,20250223
This is spoken_ not so much by way of counsel to wicked men (they will not receive instruction_ ch. xxiii. but rather in defiance of them_ for the encouragement of good people that are threatened by them. See here,20250223
This is the best of it; and what then is the worst of it? But shall he not leave a family behind him to enjoy what he has? No_ out of the earth (not out of his roots) shall others grow_ that are nothing akin to him_ and shall fill up his place_ and rule over that for which he labored. Others (that is_ others of the same spirit and disposition) shall grow up in his place_ and be as secure as ever he was_ not warned by his fall. The way of worldlings is their folly_ and yet there is a race of those that approve their sayings_ Ps. xlix. 13.,20250223
This is the errand on which the affliction is sent; it is a command to return from iniquity_ to have no more to do with sin_ to turn from it with an aversion to it and a resolution never to return to it any more_ Hos. xiv. 8.,20250223
This is the portion of hypocrites_ whom Christ denounced many woes against. If they continue impenitent_ ,20250223
This is the proposition he lays down and undertakes to prove: Vanity of vanities_ all is vanity. It was no new text; his father David had more than once spoken to the same purport. The truth itself here asserted is_ that all is vanity_ all besides God and considered as abstract from him_ the all of this world_ all worldly employments and enjoyments_ the all that is in the world (1 John ii. all that which is agreeable to our senses and to our fancies in this present state_ which gains pleasure to ourselves or reputation with others. It is all vanity_ not only in the abuse of it_ when it is perverted by the sin of man_ but even in the use of it. Man_ considered with reference to these things_ is vanity (Ps. xxxix. 5_ and_ if there were not another life after this_ were made in vain (Ps. lxxxix. 47); and those things_ considered in reference to man (whatever they are in themselves)_ are vanity. They are impertinent to the soul_ foreign_ and add nothing to it; they do not answer the end_ nor yield any true satisfaction; they are uncertain in their continuance_ are fading_ and perishing_ and passing away_ and will certainly deceive and disappoint those that put a confidence in them. Let us not therefore love vanity (Ps. iv. nor lift up our souls to it (Ps. xxiv.,20250223
This is the same with what he had said_ ch. xxi,20250223
This is the world of service; that to come is the world of recompence. This is the world of probation and preparation for eternity; we are here upon business_ and upon our good behaviour. ,20250223
This is to the same purport with v. 2_ and shows what a blessing a wise man is and what a burden a fool is to those about him. Only here observe further,20250223
This is to the same purport with what was said v,20250223
This is to the same purport with what we had ch. xvi. 14_ 15_ and the design of it is,20250223
This is to the same purport with what we had_ v,20250223
This is urged as a reason why we should be content with such things as we have_ 1 Tim. vi,20250223
This is vanity in particular (v. 19_ nay_ it is vanity and a great evil_ v,20250223
This is what was said before_ ch. xxviii. 12_ 28. 1. The people will have cause to rejoice or mourn according as their rulers are righteous or wicked; for_ if the righteous be in authority_ sin will be punished and restrained_ religion and virtue will be supported and kept in reputation; but_ if the wicked get power in their hands_ wickedness will abound_ religion and religious people will be persecuted_ and so the ends of government will be perverted,20250223
This justly condemns those who_ being employed in the administration of justice_ pervert judgment,20250223
This law of charity and generosity is abused to be a colour for gluttony and excess: __Come___ says she_ __come home with me_ for I have good cheer enough_ and only want good company to help me off with it.__ It was a pity that the peace-offerings should thus become_ in a bad sense_ sin-offerings_ and that what was designed for the honour of God should become the food and fuel of a base lust. But this is not all. ,20250223
This may be meant either,20250223
This may be taken as showing us,20250223
This may be taken two ways:—1. As a reason why we should be diligent in our business_ that we may avoid that sinking dispiriting uneasiness which attends poverty_ and may enjoy the benefit and comfort which those have that are beforehand in the world. Taking pains is really the way to make ourselves and our families easy. Or_ rather_ 2. As a representation of the common mistakes both of rich and poor_ concerning their outward condition. ,20250223
This may be understood as spoken by the Jewish church concerning the Gentile world. God has espoused the church of the Jews to himself_ and she was richly endowed_ but what shall become of the poor Gentiles_ the barren that has not borne_ and the desolate? Isa. liv. 1. Their condition (say the pious Jews) is very deplorable and forlorn; they are sisters_ children of the same fathers_ God and Adam_ but they are little_ because not dignified with the knowledge of God; they have no breasts_ no divine revelation_ no scriptures_ no ministers_ no breasts of consolation drawn out to them_ when they might suck_ being strangers to the covenants of promise_ no breasts of instruction themselves to draw out to their children_ to nourish them_ 1 Pet. ii,20250223
This may be well called vanity_ and an evil disease. What we have we have in vain if we do not use it; and that temper of mind is certainly a most wretched distemper which keeps us from using it. Our worst diseases are those that arise from the corruption of our own hearts,20250223
This may include a double sense:—1. That wicked people are scornful people_ and put contempt upon others. When the wicked comes into any company_ comes into the schools of wisdom or into the assemblies for religious worship_ then comes contempt of God_ of his people and ministers_ and of every thing that is said and done. You can expect no other from those that are profane than that they will be scoffers; they will be an ignominy and reproach; they will flout and jeer every thing that is serious and grave. But let not wise and good men regard it_ for the proverb of the ancients says_ such wickedness proceeds from the wicked,20250223
This newborn babe is clothed and swaddled_,20250223
This observation is applicable_,20250223
This prayer was answered in the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of pentecost (Acts ii. 1)_ ushered in by a mighty wind; then the apostles_ who were bound up before_ flowed forth_ and were a sweet savour to God_ 2 Cor. ii. 15,20250223
This principle Job here opposes_ and maintains that God_ in disposing men's outward affairs_ acts as a sovereign_ reserving the exact distribution of rewards and punishments for the future state.,20250223
This prudent friendly concealment is here opposed to two very bad vices of the tongue:—1. Speaking scornfully of a man to his face: He that is void of wisdom discovers his folly by this; he despises his neighbour_ calls him Raca_ and Thou fool_ upon the least provocation_ and tramples upon him as not worthy to be set with the dogs of his flock. He undervalues himself who thus undervalues one that is made of the same mould,20250223
This put a new face upon his affairs immediately_ and every thing now looked as pleasing and promising as before it had looked gloomy and frightful. 1. God turned his captivity_ that is_ he redressed his grievances and took away all the causes of his complaints; he loosed him from the bond with which Satan had now_ for a great while_ bound him_ and delivered him out of those cruel hands into which he had delivered him. We may suppose that now all his bodily pains and distempers were healed so suddenly and so thoroughly that the cure was next to miraculous: His flesh became fresher than a child's_ and he returned to the days of his youth; and_ what was more_ he felt a very great alteration in his mind; it was calm and easy_ and the tumult was all over_ his disquieting thoughts had all vanished_ his fears were silenced_ and the consolations of God were now as much the delight of his soul as his terrors had been its burden. The tide thus turned_ his troubles began to ebb as fast as they had flowed_ just then when he was praying for his friends_ praying over his sacrifice which he offered for them. Mercy did not return when he was disputing with his friends_ no_ not though he had right on his side_ but when he was praying for them; for God is better served and pleased with our warm devotions than with our warm disputations. When Job completed his repentance by this instance of his forgiving men their trespasses_ then God completed his remission by turning his captivity. Note_ We are really doing our business when we are praying for our friends_ if we pray in a right manner_ for in those prayers there is not only faith_ but love. Christ has taught us to pray with and for others in teaching us to say_ Our Father; and_ in seeking mercy for others_ we may find mercy ourselves. Our Lord Jesus has his exaltation and dominion there_ where he ever lives making intercession. Some_ by the turning of Job's captivity_ understand the restitution which the Sabeans and Chaldeans made of the cattle which they had taken from him_ God wonderfully inclining them to do it; and with these he began the world again. Probably it was so; those spoilers had swallowed down his riches_ but they were forced to vomit them up again_ ch. xx,20250223
This question is not only a challenge to any man in the world to prove himself sinless_ whatever he pretends_ but a lamentation of the corruption of mankind_ even that which remains in the best. Alas! Who can say_ __I am sinless?__ Observe,20250223
This recommends the grace of meekness to us_ which will well become us all_ particularly the hoary head_ v,20250223
This should encourage us to be careful and industrious about our business_ that that will bring in a sufficient maintenance for our families; we shall eat the labour of our hands.,20250223
This should teach us to look with a holy contempt upon the wealth of this world_ not to set our hearts upon that_ but with all possible care to think of those things that are lovely and of good report_ Phil. iv. 8.,20250223
This shows how wisely the great God serves the designs of his providence by persons of very different tempers_ capacities_ and conditions in the world_ even,20250223
This shows that as men are so is their way. 1. Evil men have evil ways. If the man be froward_ his way also is strange; and this is the way of most men_ such is the general corruption of mankind. They have all gone aside (Ps. xiv. 2_ 3); all flesh have perverted their way. But the froward man_ the man of deceit_ that acts by craft and trick in all he does_ his way is strange_ contrary to all the rules of honour and honesty. It is strange_ for you know not where to find him nor when you have him; it is strange_ for it is alienated from all good and estranges men from God and his favour. It is what he behold afar off_ and so do all honest men,20250223
This shows that both young and old have their advantages_ and therefore must each of them be_ according to their capacities_ serviceable to the public_ and neither of them despise nor envy the other. 1. Let not old people despise the young_ for they are strong and fit for action_ able to go through business and break through difficulties_ which the aged and weak cannot grapple with. The glory of young men is their strength_ provided they use it well (in the service of God and their country_ not of their lusts)_ and that they be not proud of it nor trust to it,20250223
This shows that in a well-ordered court and government smiles and favours are dispensed among those that are employed in public trusts according to their merits; Solomon lets them know he will go by that rule,20250223
This shows that one tale is good till another is told. 1. He that speaks first will be sure to tell a straight story_ and relate that only which makes for him_ and put the best colour he can upon it_ so that his cause shall appear good_ whether it really be so or no,20250223
This shows that riches wear as they are won and woven. 1. That which is won ill will never wear well_ for a curse attends it which will waste it_ and the same corrupt dispositions which incline men to the sinful ways of getting well incline them to the like sinful ways of spending: Wealth gotten by vanity will be bestowed upon vanity_ and then it will be diminished. That which is got by such employments as are not lawful_ or not becoming Christians_ such as only serve to feed pride and luxury_ that which is got by gaming or by the stage_ may as truly be said to be gotten by vanity as that which is got by fraud and lying_ and will be diminished. De male quæsitis vix gaudet tertius hæres—Ill-gotten wealth will scarcely be enjoyed by the third generation,20250223
This shows that the vigorous endeavour of a prince to suppress vice_ and reform the manners of his people_ is the most effectual way to support his government. Observe,20250223
This shows that those who cannot bear to be corrected must expect to be destroyed. 1. It is common for those who have known the way of righteousness_ but have forsaken it_ to reckon it a great affront to be reproved and admonished. They are very uneasy at reproof; they cannot_ they will not_ bear it; nay_ because they hate to be reformed_ they hate to be reproved_ and hate those who deal faithfully and kindly with them. Of all sinners_ reproofs are worst resented by apostates.,20250223
This shows the folly of those that hope to enrich themselves by dishonest practices_ by oppressing and over-reaching those with whom they deal_ by false-witness-bearing_ or by fraudulent contracts_ of those that make no scruples of lying when there is any thing to be got by it. They may perhaps heap up treasures by these means_ that which they make their treasure; but,20250223
This shows the folly of those that refuse instruction_ for they might be happy and will not. 1. They might be happy. There are in man strong desires of happiness; God has provided for the accomplishment of those desires_ and that would be sweet to the soul_ whereas the pleasures of sense are grateful only to the carnal appetite. The desire of good men towards the favour of God and spiritual blessings brings that which is sweet to their souls; we know those that can say so by experience_ Ps. iv. 6_ 7,20250223
This shows the vanity of carnal mirth_ and proves what Solomon said of laughter_ that it is mad; for,20250223
This shows us that there is a way,20250223
This shows what an offence it is to God,20250223
This shows what evil courses rich men sometimes take_ by which_ in the end_ they will impoverish themselves and provoke God_ notwithstanding their abundance_ to bring them to want; they oppress the poor and give to the rich. 1. They will not in charity relieve the poor_ but withhold from them_ that by saving that which is really the best_ but which they think the most needless part of their expenses_ they may increase their riches; but they will make presents to the rich_ and give them great entertainments_ either in pride and vain-glory_ that they may look great_ or in policy_ that they may receive it again with advantage. Such shall surely come to want. Many have been beggared by a foolish generosity_ but never any by a prudent charity. Christ bids us to invite the poor_ Luke xiv. 12_ 13,20250223
This shows what great blessings good men are_ especially those that are eminently wise_ to the places where they live_ and therefore how much to be valued. 1. The righteous are as trees of life; the fruits of their piety and charity_ their instructions_ reproofs_ examples_ and prayers_ their interest in heaven_ and their influence upon earth_ are like the fruits of that tree_ precious and useful_ contributing to the support and nourishment of the spiritual life in many; they are the ornaments of paradise_ God's church on earth_ for whose sake it stands,20250223
This shows_ not what should be_ but what is the common way of the world—to be shy of the poor and fond of the rich. 1. Few will give countenance to those whom the world frowns upon_ though otherwise worthy of respect: The poor_ who should be pitied_ and encouraged_ and relieved_ is hated_ looked strange upon_ and kept at a distance_ even by his own neighbour_ who_ before he fell into disgrace_ was intimate with him and pretended to have a kindness for him. Most are swallow-friends_ that are gone in winter. It is good having God our friend_ for he will not desert us when we are poor,20250223
This song might easily be taken in a spiritual sense by the Jewish church_ for whose use it was first composed_ and was so taken_ as appears by the Chaldee-Paraphrase and the most ancient Jewish expositors. God betrothed the people of Israel to himself; he entered into covenant with them_ and it was a marriage-covenant. He had given abundant proofs of his love to them_ and required of them that they should love him with all their heart and soul. Idolatry was often spoken of as spiritual adultery_ and doting upon idols_ to prevent which this song was penned_ representing the complacency which God took in Israel and which Israel ought to take in God_ and encouraging them to continue faithful to him_ though he might seem sometimes to withdraw and hide himself from them_ and to wait for the further manifestation of himself in the promised Messiah.,20250223
This speaks much the honour of this eternal Wisdom_ for by this instance God proves himself a God greatly to be feared (Jer. v.,20250223
This tells us what the desire and expectation of the righteous and of the wicked are and how they will prove_ what they would have and what they shall have. 1. The righteous would have good_ only good; all they desire is that it may go well with all about them; they wish no hurt to any_ but happiness to all; as to themselves_ their desire is not to gratify any evil lust_ but to obtain the favour of a good God and to preserve the peace of a good conscience; and good they shall have_ that good which they desire_ Ps. xxxvii. 4,20250223
This the grace of God shall work in thee; nay_ sometimes the providence of God shall give thee the very thing thou didst desire and pray for_ and give it thee in thy own way_ and manner_ and time. Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.__ When at any time an affair succeeds just according to the scheme we laid_ and our measures are in nothing broken_ nor are we put upon new counsels_ then we must own the performance of this promise_ Thou shalt decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee. __Whereas now thou complainest of darkness round about thee_ then the light shall shine on thy ways;__ that is_ __God shall guide and direct thee_ and then it will follow_ of course_ that he shall prosper and succeed thee in all thy undertakings. God's wisdom shall be thy guide_ his favour thy comfort_ and thy ways shall be so under both those lights that thou shalt have a comfortable enjoyment of what is present and a comfortable prospect of what is future___ Ps. xc. 17.,20250223
This therefore we should deprecate above any thing else_ when we are in affliction. __However thou art pleased to deal with me_ Lord_ do not condemn me; my friends condemn me_ but do not thou.__ 2. That he might be made acquainted with the true cause of his afflictions_ and that is sin too: Lord_ show me wherefore thou contendest with me. When God afflicts us he contends with us_ and when he contends with us there is always a reason. He is never angry without a cause_ though we are; and it is desirable to know what the reason is_ that we may repent of_ mortify_ and forsake the sin for which God has a controversy with us. In enquiring it out_ let conscience have leave to do its office and to deal faithfully with us_ as Gen. xlii. 21.,20250223
This toil and this trouble are what God has allotted us. He never intended this world for our rest_ and therefore never appointed us to take our ease in it. ,20250223
This understanding spirit is in every man; it is the light that lighteth every man_ John i,20250223
This verse is the title of this latter collection of Solomon's proverbs_ for he sought out and set in order many proverbs_ that by them he might be still teaching the people knowledge_ Eccl. xii.,20250223
This was the law (Exod. xxiii. and the prophets_ Mal. iii God_ who is the first and best_ must have the first and best of every thing; his right is prior to all other_ and therefore he must be served first. Note_ It is our duty to make our worldly estates serviceable to our religion_ to use them and the interest we have by them for the promoting of religion_ to do good to the poor with what we have and abound in all works of piety and charity_ devising liberal things.,20250223
This was the sin of the giants of the old world_ and a sin that_ as much as any_ brings God's judgments upon nations and families. It is charged upon this wicked man_ ,20250223
This we had before (ch. xiv. but here it is repeated_ as that which is very necessary to be thought of,20250223
This we had before (ch. xix. and it shows that there are two ways by which the simple may be made wise:—1. By the punishments that are inflicted on those that are incorrigibly wicked. Let the law be executed upon a scorner_ and even he that is simple will be awakened and alarmed by it_ and will discern_ more than he did_ the evil of sin_ and will take warning by it and take heed.,20250223
This we had before_ ch. xxii,20250223
This we must do quickly_ now_ before it be too late. Agree with thy adversary while thou art in the way. This we are earnestly urged to do. Some read it_ __Acquaint thyself_ I pray thee_ with him_ and be at peace.__ God himself beseeches us; ministers_ in Christ's stead_ pray us to be reconciled. Can we gainsay such entreaties? 3. Receive the law from his mouth_ v,20250223
This will be an evidence that thou art wise and a means to make thee wiser.__ Wisdom_ as faith_ comes by hearing. And again (v. 22): __Hearken unto thy father who begot thee_ and who therefore has an authority over thee and an affection for thee_ and_ thou mayest be sure_ can have no other design than thy own good.__ We ought to give reverence to the fathers of our flesh_ who begot us_ and were the instruments of our being; much more ought we to obey and be in subjection to the Father of our spirits_ who made us and is the author of our being. And since the mother also_ from a sense of duty to God and from love to her child_ gives him good instructions_ let him not despise her_ nor her advice_ when she is old. When the mother was grown old we may suppose the children to be grown up; but let them not think themselves past being taught_ even by her_ but rather respect her the more for the multitude of her years and the wisdom which they teach. Scornful and insolent young men will make a jest_ it may be_ of the good advice of an aged mother_ and think themselves not concerned to heed what an old woman says; but such will have a great deal to answer for another day_ not only as having set at nought good counsel_ but as having slighted and grieved a good mother_ ch. xxx. 17.,20250223
This wisdom will be of use to guide and direct us in that which is good (v. 20): That thou mayest walk in the way of good men. We must avoid the way of the evil man_ and the strange woman_ in order that we may walk in good ways; we must cease to do evil_ in order that we may learn to do well. Note,20250223
This wisdom will be of use to us_,20250223
This would be looked upon as an insufferable affront to majesty and to magistracy; no king_ no prince_ would bear it. In favour of government_ we presume it is a right sentence that is passed_ unless the contrary be very evident; but_ whatever we think_ it is not fit to tell a king to his face that he is wicked. Nathan reproved David by a parable. But_ whatever a high priest or a prophet might do_ it is not for an ordinary subject to make so bold with the powers that are. How absurd is then to say so to God—to impute iniquity to him_ who_ having no respect of persons_ is in no temptation to do an unjust thing! He regardeth not the rich more than the poor_ and therefore it is fit he should rule_ and it is not fit we should find fault with him_ v,20250223
This wrath shall be cast upon him when he is about to fill his belly_ just going to glut himself with what he has gotten and promising himself abundant satisfaction in it. Then_ when he is eating_ shall this tempest surprise him_ when he is secure and easy_ and in apprehension of no danger; as the ruin of the old world and Sodom came when they were in the depth of their security and the height of their sensuality_ as Christ observes_ Luke xvii. 26_ &c. Perhaps Zophar here reflects on the death of Job's children when they were eating and drinking.,20250223
This_ I think_ is the only one of Solomon's proverbs that has that note of attention prefixed to it_ Behold! which intimates that it contains not only an evident truth_ which may be beheld_ but an eminent truth_ which must be considered. 1. Some understand both parts of a recompence in displeasure: The righteous_ if they do amiss_ shall be punished for their offences in this world; much more shall wicked people be punished for theirs_ which are committed_ not through infirmity_ but with a high hand. If judgment begin at the house of God_ what will become of the ungodly? 1 Pet.,20250223
Those are angry and sin not who are angry only at sin and take a temptation as the greatest affront_ who cannot bear those that are evil_ Rev. ii,20250223
Those are blessed that watch and wait at Wisdom's gates; even their attendance there is their happiness; it is the best place they can be in. Those are blessed that wait there_ for they shall not be put to wait long; let them continue to knock awhile and it shall be opened to them. They are seeking Wisdom_ and they shall find what they seek. But will it make them amends if they do find it? Yes (v. 35): Whoso finds me finds life_ that is_ all happiness_ all that good which he needs or can desire. He finds life in that grace which is the principle of spiritual life and the pledge of eternal life. He finds life_ for he shall obtain favour of the Lord_ and in his favour is life. If the king's favour is towards a wise son_ much more the favour of the King of kings. Christ is Wisdom_ and he that finds Christ_ that obtains an interest in him_ he finds life; for Christ is life to all believers. He that has the Son of God has life_ eternal life_ and he shall obtain favour of the Lord_ who is well-pleased with all those that are in Christ; nor can we obtain God's favour_ unless we find Christ and be found in him.,20250223
Those are here encouraged,20250223
Those are hypocrites who_ though they profess religion_ neither take pleasure in it nor persevere in it_ who reckon their religion a task and a drudgery_ a weariness_ and snuff at it_ who make use of it only to serve a turn_ and lay it aside when the turn is served_ who will call upon God while it is in fashion_ or while the pang of devotion lasts_ but leave it off when they fall into other company_ or when the hot fit is over. ,20250223
Those are indeed of troubled spirits who are troubled at the presence of God_ as the psalmist_ who remembered God and was troubled_ Ps. lxxvii,20250223
Those are inhuman murderers indeed that can with so much pleasure suck innocent blood. They take a pledge of the poor_ and so they rob the spital; nay_ they take the poor themselves for a pledge (as some read it)_ and probably it was under this pretence that they plucked the fatherless from the breast_ distraining them for slaves_ as Neh. v,20250223
Those are very unwise that do_ and enemies to themselves_ who depend upon it as sufficient to make them happy_ who think themselves safe and honourable_ and sure of comfort_ in having abundance of this world's goods. Some make it their hope and confidence for another world_ as if it were a certain token of God's favour; and those who have so much sense as not to think so yet promise themselves that it will be a portion for them in this life_ whereas the things themselves are uncertain and our satisfaction in them is much more so. It is hard to have riches and not to trust in riches; and it is this which makes it so difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God_ Matt. xix. 23; Mark,20250223
Those become an easy prey to Satan who_ when they have arrived to the stature of men_ have scarcely the understanding of children,20250223
Those commonly sleep best that work hard and have but what they work for: The sleep of the labouring man is sweet_ not only because he has tired himself with his labour_ which makes his sleep the more welcome to him and makes him sleep soundly_ but because he has little to fill his head with care about and so break his sleep. His sleep is sweet_ though he eat but little and have but little to eat_ for his weariness rocks him asleep; and_ though he eat much_ yet he can sleep well_ for his labour gets him a good digestion. The sleep of the diligent Christian_ and his long sleep_ is sweet; for_ having spent himself and his time in the service of God_ he can cheerfully return to God and repose in him as his rest. ,20250223
Those days of darkness will be many; the days of our lying under ground will be more than the days of our living above ground. They are many_ but they are not infinite; many as they are_ they will be numbered and finished when the heavens are no more_ Job xiv,20250223
Those he specifies are,20250223
Those in the other world will be wholly taken up with that world_ so that they will not care for seeing what is done in this; and while we are here we cannot foresee what shall be after us_ either as to our families or the public. It is not for us to know the times and seasons that shall be after us_ which_ as it should be a restraint to our cares about this world_ so it should be a reason for our concern about another. Since death is a final farewell to this life_ let us look before us to another life.,20250223
Those make themselves fat_ and always easy_ that live in a continual dependence upon God and his grace: He who puts his trust in the Lord_ who_ instead of struggling for himself_ commits his cause to God_ shall be made fat. He saves the money which others spend upon their pride and contentiousness; he enjoys himself_ and has abundant satisfaction in his God; and thus his soul dwells at ease_ and he is most likely to have plenty of outward good things. None live so easily_ so pleasantly_ as those who live by faith.,20250223
Those make themselves lean_ and continually unquiet_ that are haughty and quarrelsome_ for they are opposed to those that shall be made fat: He that is of a proud heart_ that is conceited of himself and looks with a contempt upon all about him_ that cannot bear either competition or contradiction_ he stirs up strife_ makes mischief_ and creates disturbance to himself and every body else,20250223
Those may be said to flatter their neighbours who commend and applaud that good in them (the good they do or the good they have) which really either is not or is not such as they represent it_ and who profess that esteem and that affection for them which really they have not; these spread a net for their feet. 1. For their neighbours' feet_ whom they flatter. They have an ill design in it; they would not praise them as they do but that they hope to make an advantage of them; and it is therefore wisdom to suspect those who flatter us_ that they are secretly laying a snare for us_ and to stand on our guard accordingly. Or it has an ill effect on those who are flattered; it puffs them up with pride_ and makes them conceited and confident of themselves_ and so proves a net that entangles them in sin,20250223
Those only may expect the kisses of Christ's mouth_ and the comfortable tokens of his favour_ who prefer his love before all delights of the children of men_ who would rather forego those delights than forfeit his favour_ and take more pleasure in spiritual joys than in any bodily refreshments whatsoever. Observe here the change of the person: Let him kiss me; there she speaks of him as absent_ or as if she were afraid to speak to him; but_ in the next words_ she sees him near at hand_ and therefore directs her speech to him: __Thy love_ thy loves__ (so the word is)_ __I so earnestly desire_ because I highly esteem it.__,20250223
Those only that can in sincerity call Christ their beloved_ their best beloved_ can_ upon good grounds_ desire him to hasten his second coming. As for those whose hearts go a whoring after the world_ and who set their affections on the things of the earth_ they cannot love his appearing_ but dread it rather_ because then the earth_ and all the things of it which they have chosen for their portion_ will be burnt up. But those that truly love Christ long for his second coming_ because it will be the crown both of his glory and their bliss,20250223
Those only whom God protects are safe and may be easy; and therefore those who have ever so much of this world must not think themselves safe unless God preserve them,20250223
Those painful sores_ and all thy losses_ show,20250223
Those really hate their children_ though they pretend to be fond of them_ that do not keep them under a strict discipline_ and by all proper methods_ severe ones when gentle ones will not serve_ make them sensible of their faults and afraid of offending. They abandon them to their worst enemy_ to the most dangerous disease_ and therefore hate them. Let this reconcile children to the correction their good parents give them; it is from love_ and for their good_ Heb. xii. 7-9.,20250223
Those riches that have been laid up with a great deal of pains_ and kept with a great deal of care_ perish by evil travail_ by the very pains and care which they take to secure and increase them. Many a one has ruined his estate by being over-solicitous to advance it and make it more_ and has lost all by catching at all. Riches are perishing things_ and all our care about them cannot make them otherwise; they make themselves wings and fly away. He that thought he should have made his son a gentleman leaves him a beggar; he begets a son_ and brings him up in the prospect of an estate_ but_ when he dies_ leaves it under a charge of debt as much as it is worth_ so that there is nothing in his hand. This is a common case; estates that made a great show do not prove what they seemed_ but cheat the heir.,20250223
Those show themselves not only void of grace_ but void of common sense_ that take it as an affront to be told of their faults_ and an imposition upon their liberty to be put in mind of their duty: He that hates reproof is not only foolish_ but brutish_ like the horse and the mule that have no understanding_ or the ox that kicks against the goad. Those that desire to live in loose families and societies_ where they may be under no check_ that stifle the convictions of their own consciences_ and count those their enemies that tell them the truth_ are the brutish here meant.,20250223
Those that are ambitious and aspiring expose themselves to a great deal of trouble_ such as often ends in their ruin: He that exalts his gate_ builds a stately house_ at least a fine frontispiece_ that he may overtop and outshine his neighbours_ seeks his own destruction and takes a deal of pains to ruin himself; he makes his gate so large that his house and estate go out at it.,20250223
Those that are at variance with Christ are in love with their own ruin: Those that hate me love death; they love that which will be their death_ and put that from them which would be their life. Sinners die because they will die_ which leaves them inexcusable_ makes their condemnation the more intolerable_ and will for ever justify God when he judges. O Israel! thou hast destroyed thyself.,20250223
Those that are but going behindhand find themselves to lie much at the mercy of those that are before hand: The borrower is servant to the lender_ is obliged to him_ and must sometimes beg_ Have patience with me. Therefore it is part of Israel's promised happiness that they should lend and borrow_ Deut.,20250223
Those that are covetous entail trouble upon their families: He that is greedy of gain_ and therefore makes himself a slave to the world_ rises up early_ sits up late_ and eats the bread of carefulness_ in pursuit of it—he that hurries_ and puts himself and all about him upon the stretch_ in business_ frets and vexes at every loss and disappointment_ and quarrels with every body that stands in the way of his profit—he troubles his own house_ is a burden and vexation to his children and servants. He that_ in his greediness of gain_ takes bribes_ and uses unlawful ways of getting money_ leaves a curse with what he gets to those that come after him_ which sooner or later will bring trouble into the house_ Hab. ii. 9_ 10,20250223
Those that are dejected God delights to support_ and often does it remarkably: He will establish the border of the poor widow_ which proud injurious men break in upon_ and which the poor widow is not herself able to defend and make good. It is the honour of God to protect the weak and appear for those that are oppressed.,20250223
Those that are diligent in their callings take the way to live comfortably: He that tills his land_ and tends his shop_ and minds his business_ whatever it is_ he shall have plenty of bread_ of that which is necessary for himself and his family and with which he may be charitable to the poor; he shall eat the labour of his hands,20250223
Those that are elevated God delights to abase_ and commonly does it in the course of his providence: The proud_ that magnify themselves_ bid defiance to the God above them and trample on all about them_ are such as God resists and will destroy_ not them only_ but their houses_ which they are proud of and are confident of the continuance and perpetuity of. Pride is the ruin of multitudes,20250223
Those that are entangled in this sin should be reminded that there is but a step between them and hell_ and that they are ready to drop into it. ,20250223
Those that are false and dishonest are never safe: He that is perverse in his ways_ that thinks to secure himself by fraudulent practices_ by dissimulation and treachery_ or by an estate ill-got_ he shall fall_ nay_ he shall fall at once_ not gradually_ and with warning given_ but suddenly_ without previous notice_ for he is least safe when he is most secure. He falls at once_ and so has neither time to guard against his ruin nor to provide for it; and_ being a surprise upon him_ it will be so much the greater terror to him.,20250223
Those that are foolish will misspend what they have upon their lusts_ and so bring the stock they have to nothing. Those manage wretchedly that are in haste to spend what they had_ but not in care which way to get more. Foolish children spend what their wise parents have laid up. One sinner destroys much good_ as the prodigal son.,20250223
Those that are generous as well as righteous entail a blessing upon their families: He that hates gifts_ that shakes his hands from holding the bribes that are thrust into his hand to pervert justice and abhors all sinful indirect ways of getting money—that hates to be paltry and mercenary_ and is willing_ if there be occasion_ to do good gratis—he shall live; he shall have the comfort of life_ shall live in prosperity and reputation; his name and family shall live and continue.,20250223
Those that are guilty of so great an oversight as to entrust such with any affair_ and put confidence in them_ will certainly have vexation with them. A slothful servant is to his master as uneasy and troublesome as vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes; he provokes his passion_ as vinegar sets the teeth on edge_ and occasions him grief to see his business neglected and undone_ as smoke sets the eyes a weeping.,20250223
Those that are honest are always safe. He that acts with sincerity_ that speaks as he thinks_ has a single eye_ in every thing_ to the glory of God and the good of his brethren_ that would not_ for a world_ do an unjust thing if he knew it_ that in all manner of conversation walks uprightly_ he shall be saved hereafter. We find a glorious company of those in whose mouth was found no guile_ Rev. xiv,20250223
Those that are humble and peaceable are wise and well advised. Those that will ask and take advice_ that will consult their own consciences_ their Bibles_ their ministers_ their friends_ and will do nothing rashly_ are wise_ as in other things_ so in this_ that they will humble themselves_ will stoop and yield_ to preserve quietness and prevent quarrels.,20250223
Those that are idle_ and careless_ and company-keepers_ though they indulge themselves in living (as they think) easily and pleasantly_ they take the way to live miserably. He that has land and values himself upon that_ but does not till it_ but follows after vain persons_ drinks with them_ joins with them in their frolics and vain sports_ and idles away his time with him_ he shall have poverty enough_ shall be satiated or replenished with poverty (so the word is); he takes those courses which lead so directly to it that he seems to court it_ and he shall have his fill of it.,20250223
Those that are in league with abandoned women_ that treat them_ and court them_ and keep company with them. They will be beggars in a little time; never give them credit without good pledge. Strange women have strange ways of impoverishing men to enrich themselves.,20250223
Those that are industrious to do good in the world get themselves beloved both with God and man: He that rises early to that which is good (so the word is)_ that seeks opportunities of serving his friends and relieving the poor_ and lays out himself therein_ procures favour. All about him love him_ and speak well of him_ and will be ready to do him a kindness; and_ which is better than that_ better than life_ he has God's lovingkindness,20250223
Those that are industrious to do mischief are preparing ruin for themselves: It shall come unto them; some time or other they will be paid in their own coin. And_ observe_ seeking mischief is here set in opposition to seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt.,20250223
Those that are lively will be active; when Philip was drawn to Christ he drew Nathanael; and they will be exemplary_ and so will win those that would not be won by the word.,20250223
Those that are now toiled will there see the period of their toils. There the weary are at rest. Heaven is more than a rest to the souls of the saints_ but the grave is a rest to their bodies. Their pilgrimage is a weary pilgrimage; sin and the world they are weary of; their services_ sufferings_ and expectations_ they are wearied with; but in the grave they rest from all their labours_ Rev. xiv. 13; Isa. lvii,20250223
Those that are of a slothful disposition_ that love their ease and cannot apply their minds to any business_ are not fit to be employed_ no_ not so much as to be sent on an errand_ for they will neither deliver a message with any care nor make any haste back. Such therefore are very unmeet to be ministers_ Christ's messengers; he will not own the sending forth of sluggards into his harvest,20250223
Those that are of restless_ factious_ turbulent spirits_ commonly pull mischief upon their own heads ere they are aware: Their calamity shall rise suddenly. Though they carry on their designs with the utmost secresy_ they will be discovered_ and brought to condign punishment_ when they little think of it. Who knows the time and manner of the ruin which both God and the king will bring on their contemners_ both on them and those that meddle with them?,20250223
Those that are partial will be paltry. Those that have once broken through the bonds of equity_ though_ at first_ it must be some great bribe_ some noble present_ that would bias them_ yet_ when they have debauched their consciences_ they will_ at length_ be so sordid that for a piece of bread they will give judgment against their consciences; they will rather play at small game than sit out.,20250223
Those that are poor often prove themselves wiser than they: A poor man_ who has taken pains to get wisdom_ having no other way (as the rich man has) to get a reputation_ searches him out_ and makes it to appear that he is not such a scholar_ nor such a politician_ as he is taken to be. See how variously God dispenses his gifts; to some he gives wealth_ to others wisdom_ and it is easy to say which of these is the better gift_ which we should covet more earnestly.,20250223
Those that are proud and will put forth themselves_ that thrust_ and shove_ and scramble_ for preferment_ are the men that commonly divide the spoil and share it among them; they have the world at will and the ball at their foot,20250223
Those that are prudent will seek knowledge_ and apply their ear and heart to the pursuit of it_ their ear to attend to the means of knowledge and their heart to mix faith with what they hear and make a good improvement of it. Those that are prudent do not think they have prudence enough_ but still see they have need of more; and the more prudent a man is the more inquisitive will he be after knowledge_ the knowledge of God and his duty_ and the way to heaven_ for that is the best knowledge,20250223
Those that are quarrelsome involve themselves in a great deal of guilt: He that loves strife_ that in his worldly business loves to go to law_ in religion loves controversies_ and in common conversation loves to thwart and fall out_ that is never well but when he is in the fire_ he loves transgression; for a great deal of sin attends that sin_ and the way of it is down-hill. He pretends to stand up for truth_ and for his honour and right_ but really he loves sin_ which God hates,20250223
Those that are rich are apt to think themselves wise_ because_ whatever else they are ignorant of_ they know how to get and save; and those that are purse-proud expect that all they say should be regarded as an oracle and a law_ and that none should dare to contradict them_ but every sheaf bow to theirs; this humour is fed by flatterers_ who_ because (like Jezebel's prophets) they are fed at their table_ cry up their wisdom,20250223
Those that are so wise as to bear reproof well will hereby be made wiser (ch. ix. and come at length to be numbered among the wise men of the age_ and will have both ability and authority to reprove and instruct others. Those that learn well_ and obey well_ are likely in time to teach well and rule well.,20250223
Those that are voluptuous and given to appetite (v. 2) are glad to be where there is good cheer stirring_ and those that are covetous and saving_ that they may spare at home_ will be glad to get a dinner at another man's table; and therefore both are here advised not to be forward to accept of every man's invitation_ but especially not to thrust themselves in uninvited. Observe,20250223
Those that are wise will increase what they have and live plentifully; their wisdom will teach them to proportion their expenses to their income and to lay up for hereafter; so that there is a treasure of things to be desired_ and as much as needs be desired_ a good stock of all things convenient_ laid up in season_ and particularly of oil_ one of the staple commodities of Canaan_ Deut. viii,20250223
Those that consult the good of their neighbours_ that study the things which make for peace and give peaceable advice_ promote healing attempts and contrive healing methods_ and_ according as their sphere is_ further the public welfare_ will have not only the credit_ but the comfort of it. They will have joy and success_ perhaps beyond their expectation. Blessed are the peace-makers.,20250223
Those that design to do ill support themselves by falsehood and lying: A wicked doer gives ear_ with a great deal of pleasure_ to false lips_ that will justify him in the ill he does_ to those that aim to make public disturbances_ catch greedily at libels_ and false stories_ that defame the government and the administration,20250223
Those that despise to obey them_ that think it a thing below them to be dutiful to their parents_ especially to the mother_ they scorn to be controlled by her; and thus she that bore them in sorrow in greater sorrow bears their manners.,20250223
Those that devise mischief contrive_ for the accomplishing of it_ how to impose upon others; but it will prove_ in the end_ that they deceive themselves. Those that imagine evil_ under colour of friendship_ have their hearts full of this and the other advantage and satisfaction which they shall gain by it_ but it is all a cheat. Let them imagine it ever so artfully_ deceivers will be deceived,20250223
Those that do indeed make conscience of the law of God themselves will_ in their places_ vigorously oppose sin_ and bear their testimony against it_ and do what they can to shame and suppress it. They will reprove the works of darkness_ and silence the excuses which are made for those works_ and do what they can to bring gross offenders to punishment_ that others may hear and fear.,20250223
Those that do so will have all their servants wicked. All their servants will appear wicked_ for they will have lies told of them; and they will be wicked_ for they will tell lies to them. All that have their ear will fill their ear with slanders and false characters and representations; and so if princes_ as well as people_ will be deceived_ they shall be deceived_ and_ instead of devolving the guilt of their own false judgments upon their servants that misinformed them_ they must share in their servants' guilt_ and on them will much of the blame lie for encouraging such misinformations and giving countenance and ear to them.,20250223
Those that durst not give him his due character while he lived shall not spare him when he is dead; so that the womb that bore him_ his own mother_ shall forget him_ that is_ shall avoid making mention of him_ and shall think that the greatest kindness she can do him_ since no good can be said of him. That honour which is got by sin will soon turn into shame,20250223
Those that entertain Christ must bid his friends welcome with him; Jesus and his disciples were called together to the marriage (John ii. and Christ will have all his friends to rejoice with him in the day of his espousals to his church_ and_ in token of that_ to feast with him. In spiritual and heavenly joys there is no danger of exceeding; there we may drink abundantly_ drink of the river of God's pleasures (Ps. xxxvi. and be abundantly satisfied_ Ps. lxv. 4.,20250223
Those that excel in virtue will always be an eye-sore to those that exceed in vice_ which should not discourage us from any right work_ but drive us to expect the praise of it_ not from men_ but from God_ and not to count upon satisfaction and happiness in the creature; for_ if right works prove vanity and vexation of spirit_ no works under the sun can prove otherwise. But for every right work a man shall be accepted of his God_ and then he needs not mind though he be envied of his neighbour_ only it may make him love the world the less.,20250223
Those that experience the sweetness of communion with Christ_ and the sensible manifestations of his love_ cannot but desire the continuance of these blessed views_ these blessed visits. Pester would make tabernacles upon the holy mount_ Matt. xvii. 4,20250223
Those that feed and feast on this heavenly wisdom shall not only be cured by it of every fatal malady_ but shall find an antidote against age and death; they shall eat and live for ever.,20250223
Those that have any correct sense of things cannot but be convinced in their consciences (whatever they say) that godly people are excellent people; many will give them their good word_ and more their good-will. ,20250223
Those that have ever so much are still craving; let a man labour ever so much for his mouth_ yet the appetite is not filled. 1. Natural desires are still returning_ still pressing; a man may be feasted to-day and yet hungry to-morrow,20250223
Those that have every thing else often fail to secure a good night's sleep. Either their eyes are held waking or their sleeps are unquiet and do not refresh them; and it is their abundance that breaks their sleep and disturbs it_ both the abundance of their care (as the rich man's who_ when his ground brought forth plentifully_ thought within himself_ What shall I do? Luke xii. 17) and the abundance of what they eat and drink which overcharges the heart_ makes them sick_ and so hinders their repose. Ahasuerus_ after a banquet of wine_ could not sleep; and perhaps consciousness of guilt_ both in getting and using what they have_ breaks their sleep as much as any thing. But God gives his beloved sleep.,20250223
Those that have grown up to maturity should often call to mind_ and make mention of_ the good instructions they received when they were children_ for their own admonition_ the edification of others_ and the honour of those who were the guides of their youth.,20250223
Those that have kept their hands without spot from the world_ as Job did_ may lift up their faces without spot unto God_ and may comfort themselves with the prospect of his judgment when they lie under the unjust censures of men. If our hearts condemn us not_ then have we confidence towards God.,20250223
Those that have little will be in subjection to those that have much_ because they have dependence upon them_ they have received_ and expect to receive_ support from them: The rich rule over the poor_ and too often more than becomes them_ with pride and rigour_ unlike to God_ who_ though he be great_ yet despises not any. It is part of the affliction of the poor that they must expect to be trampled upon_ and part of their duty to be serviceable_ as far as they can_ to those that are kind to them_ and study to be grateful,20250223
Those that have made God their enemy_ and know it_ cannot but see the whole creation at war with them_ and therefore can have no true enjoyment of themselves_ no confidence_ no courage_ but a fearful looking for of judgment. Sin makes men cowards.,20250223
Those that have no love for their business will never want excuses to shake it off. Multitudes are ruined_ both for soul and body_ by their slothfulness_ and yet still they have something or other to say for themselves_ so ingenious are men in putting a cheat upon their own souls. And who_ I pray_ will be the gainer at last_ when the pretences will be all rejected as vain and frivolous?,20250223
Those that have power are apt to promise themselves great things from their power. The city of the mighty thinks itself impregnable_ and therefore its strength is the confidence thereof_ what it boasts of and trust in_ bidding defiance to danger,20250223
Those that have solid wisdom will have the credit of it; it will gain them reputation_ and they shall be called prudent grave men_ and a deference will be paid to their judgment. Do that which is wise and good and thou shalt have the praise of the same,20250223
Those that have wisdom_ though they are so modest as not to promise much_ often perform great things_ even against those that are so confident of their strength_ by their wisdom. Good conduct will go far even against great force; and a stratagem_ well managed_ may effectually scale the city of the mighty and cast down the strength it had such a confidence in. A wise man will gain upon the affections of people and conquer them by strength of reason_ which is a more noble conquest than that obtained by strength of arms. Those that understand their interest will willingly submit themselves to a wise and good man_ and the strongest walls shall not hold out against him.,20250223
Those that hold Christ fast in the arms of faith and love shall not let him go; he will abide with them.,20250223
Those that hurry over religious offices (their praying and preaching) and huddle them up in haste_ as being impatient to get done_ may be said to devour that which is holy,20250223
Those that increase in wisdom are strengthened with all might_ Col. i. 9_ 11. A wise man will compass that by his wisdom which a strong man cannot effect by force of arms. The spirit is strengthened both for the spiritual work and the spiritual warfare by true wisdom. ,20250223
Those that indulge themselves in their ease may expect to want necessaries_ which should have been gotten by honest labour. __Therefore_ though thou must sleep (nature requires it)_ yet love not sleep_ as those do that hate business. Love not sleep for its own sake_ but only as it fits for further work. Love not much sleep_ but rather grudge the time that is spent in it_ and wish thou couldst live without it_ that thou mightest always be employed in some good exercise.__ We must allow it to our bodies as men allow it to their servants_ because they cannot help it and otherwise they shall have no good of them. Those that love sleep are likely to come to poverty_ not only because they lose the time they spend in excess of sleep_ but because they contract a listless careless disposition_ and are still half asleep_ never well awake,20250223
Those that live in contention_ that are always jarring and brawling_ and reflecting upon one another_ though they have plenty of dainties_ a house full of sacrifices_ live uncomfortably; they cannot expect the blessing of God upon them and what they have_ nor can they have any true relish of their enjoyments_ much less any peace in their own consciences. Love will sweeten a dry morsel_ but strife will sour and embitter a house full of sacrifices. A little of the leaven of malice will leaven all the enjoyments.,20250223
Those that live in this sin promise themselves secresy (the eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight_ Job xxiv.,20250223
Those that live in this world must expect to have injuries done them_ affronts given them_ and trouble wrongfully created them_ for we dwell among briers. Now here we are told what to do when we have wrong done us. 1. We must not avenge ourselves_ no_ nor so much as think of revenge_ or design it: __Say not thou_ no_ not in thy heart_ I will recompense evil for evil. Do not please thyself with the thought that some time or other thou shalt have an opportunity of being quits with him. Do not wish revenge_ or hope for it_ much less resolve upon it_ no_ not when the injury is fresh and the resentment of it most deep. Never say that thou wilt do a think which thou canst not in faith pray to God to assist thee in_ and that thou canst not do in mediating revenge.__ 2. We must refer ourselves to God_ and leave it to him to plead our cause_ to maintain our right_ and reckon with those that do us wrong in such a way and manner as he thinks fit and in his own due time: __Wait on the Lord_ and attend his pleasure_ acquiesce in his will_ and he does not say that he will punish him that has injured thee (instead of desiring that thou must forgive him and pray for him)_ but he will save thee_ and that is enough. He will protect thee_ so that thy passing by one injury shall not (as is commonly feared) expose thee to another; nay_ he will recompense good to thee_ to balance thy trouble and encourage thy patience___ as David hoped_ when Shimei cursed him_ 2 Sam. xvi.,20250223
Those that look upon them with compassion are here said to be in a good condition_ according to their character: He that has mercy on the poor_ is ready to do all the good offices he can to him_ and thereby puts an honour upon him_ happy is he; he does that which is pleasing to God_ which he himself will afterwards reflect upon with great satisfaction_ for which the loins of the poor will bless him_ and which will be abundantly recompensed in the resurrection of the just.,20250223
Those that loved him would rejoice with him; but those that hated him_ and had triumphed in his fall_ would be ashamed of their insolence_ when they should see him restored to his former prosperity. Now it is true that God will not cast away an upright man; he may be cast down for a time_ but he shall not be cast away for ever. It is true that_ if not in this world_ yet in another_ the mouth of the righteous shall be filled with rejoicing. Though their sun should set under a cloud_ yet it shall rise again clear_ never more to be clouded; though they go mourning to the grave_ that shall not hinder their entrance into the joy of their Lord. It is true that the enemies of the saints will be clothed with shame when they see them crowned with honour. But it does not therefore follow that_ if Job were not perfectly restore to his former prosperity_ he would forfeit the character of a perfect man,20250223
Those that make God's word their rule shall walk at liberty_ and be at ease in themselves,20250223
Those that mock at them_ though it be but with a scornful eye_ looking with disdain upon them because of their bodily infirmities_ or looking sour or dogged at them when they instruct or command_ impatient at their checks and angry at them. God takes notice with what eye children look upon their parents_ and will reckon for the leering look and the casts of the evil eye as well as for the bad language given them. ,20250223
Those that now are troubled will there be out of the reach of trouble (v. 17): There the wicked cease from troubling. When persecutors die they can no longer persecute; their hatred and envy will then perish. Herod had vexed the church_ but_ when he became a prey for worms_ he ceased from troubling. When the persecuted die they are out of the danger of being any further troubled. Had Job been at rest in his grave_ he would have had no disturbance from the Sabeans and Chaldeans_ none of all his enemies would have created him any trouble. ,20250223
Those that offend Christ do the greatest wrong to themselves; they wrong their own souls; they wound their own consciences_ bring a blot and stain upon their souls_ which renders them odious in the eyes of God_ and unfit for communion with him; they deceive themselves_ disturb themselves_ destroy themselves. Sin is a wrong to the soul. ,20250223
Those that openly do wrong to their poor neighbours are not reckoned with_ nor the injured righted (ver. 2-12)_ though the former are very barbarous_ ver. 21_ 22.,20250223
Those that praise the wicked make it to appear that they do themselves forsake the law_ and go contrary to it_ for that curses and condemns the wicked. Wicked people will speak well of one another_ and so strengthen one another's hands in their wicked ways_ hoping thereby to silence the clamours of their own consciences and to serve the interests of the devil's kingdom_ which is not done by any thing so effectually as by keeping vice in reputation,20250223
Those that prudently seek knowledge shall certainly get knowledge_ for God never said to such_ Seek in vain_ but_ Seek and you shall find. If the ear seeks it_ the heart gets it_ and keeps it_ and is enriched by it. We must get knowledge_ not only into our heads_ but into our hearts_ get the savour and relish of it_ apply what we know to ourselves and experience the power and influence of it.,20250223
Those that put themselves forth_ in compliance with divine grace_ shall find that their zeal will provoke many_ 2 Cor. ix,20250223
Those that remain shall be buried in death_ that is_ shall die of the plague_ which is called death (Rev. vi. and be buried privately and in haste_ as soon as they are dead_ without any solemnity_ buried with the burial of an ass; and even their widows shall not weep; they shall not have wherewithal to put them in mourning. Or it denotes that these wicked men_ as they live undesired_ so they die unlamented_ and even their widows will think themselves happy that they have got rid of them.,20250223
Those that scorn judgments cannot escape them_ v,20250223
Those that secretly practise mischief often go undiscovered and unpunished_ ver. 13-17.,20250223
Those that see it are affrighted_ so sudden is the change_ so dreadful the execution_ so threatening to all about him: and those that come after_ and hear the report of it_ are astonished at it; their ears are made to tingle_ and their hearts to tremble_ and they cry out_ Lord_ how terrible art thou in thy judgments! A place or person utterly ruined is said to be made an astonishment_ Deut. xxviii. 37,20250223
Those that seek and find them_ find and keep them_ shall find in them_ ,20250223
Those that sincerely turn to God may expect_,20250223
Those that sow the tares of heresy or schism_ and_ like Diotrephes_ trouble the peace of the church and obstruct the progress of the gospel_ they are the foxes_ the little foxes_ which must not be knocked on the head (Christ came not to destroy men's lives)_ but taken_ that they may be tamed_ or else restrained from doing mischief.,20250223
Those that stir up themselves to their business may expect to have conveniences: __Open thy eyes_ awake and shake off sleep_ see how far in the day it is_ how thy work wants thee_ and how busy others are about thee! And_ when thou art awake_ look up_ look to thy advantages_ and do not let slip thy opportunities; apply thy mind closely to thy business and be in care about it. It is the easy condition of a great advantage: Open thy eyes and thou shalt be satisfied with bread; if thou dost not grow rich_ yet though shalt have enough_ and that is as good as a feast.__,20250223
Those that take a pride in being quick commonly fall under the just reproach of being impertinent. It is folly for a man to go about to speak to a thing which he does not understand_ or to pass sentence upon a matter which he is not truly and fully informed of_ and has not patience to make a strict enquiry into; and_ if it be folly_ it is and will be shame.,20250223
Those that take the liberty to tell lies take a pleasure in hearing them told: A liar gives heed to a malicious backbiting tongue_ that he may have something to graft his lies upon_ and with which to give them some colour of truth and so to support them. Sinners will strengthen one another's hands; and those show that they are bad themselves who court the acquaintance and need the assistance of those that are bad.,20250223
Those that truly love Christ will think all they have_ even their most pleasant fruits_ and what they have treasured up most carefully_ too little to be bestowed upon him_ and he is welcome to it all; if it were more and better_ it should be at his service. It is all from him_ and therefore it is fit it should be all for him.,20250223
Those that wait at wisdom's gates shall be made to come (so the word is) into her chambers; they shall be led into truth and comfort.,20250223
Those that were at a vast distance from others are there upon a level (v. 19): The small and great are there_ there the same_ there all one_ all alike free among the dead. The tedious pomp and state which attend the great are at an end there. All the inconveniences of a poor and low condition are likewise over; death and the grave know no difference.,20250223
Those that were bold and courageous_ and made nothing of dangers_ are strangely cowed and dispirited; and this also is the Lord's doing (v. 24): He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people_ that were their leaders and commanders_ and were most famed for their martial fire and great achievements; when any thing is to be done they are heartless_ and ready to flee at the shaking of a leaf. Ps. lxvi,20250223
Those that were driving on their projects with full speed are strangely bewildered and at a loss; they know not where they are nor what they do_ are unsteady in their counsels and uncertain in their motions_ off and on_ this way and that way_ wandering like men in a desert (v. groping like men in the dark_ and staggering like men in drink_ v,20250223
Those that were famed for eloquence_ and entrusted with public business_ are strangely silenced_ and have nothing to say (v.,20250223
Those that were here enslaved are there at liberty. Death is the prisoner's discharge_ the relief of the oppressed_ and the servant's manumission (v. 18): There the prisoners_ though they walk not at large_ yet they rest together_ and are not put to work_ to grind in that prison-house. They are no more insulted and trampled upon_ menaced and terrified_ by their cruel task-masters: They hear not the voice of the oppressor. Those that were here doomed to perpetual servitude_ that could call nothing their own_ no_ not their own bodies_ are there no longer under command or control: There the servant is free from his master_ which is a good reason why those that have power should use it moderately_ and those that are in subjection should bear it patiently_ yet a little while. ,20250223
Those that were high and in authority are strangely brought down_ impoverished_ and enslaved_ and it is God that humbles them (v. 18): He looseth the bond of kings_ and taketh from them the power wherewith they ruled their subjects_ perhaps enslaved them and ruled them with rigour; he strips them of all the ensigns of their honour and authority_ and all the supports of their tyranny_ unbuckles their belts_ so that the sword drops from their side_ and then no marvel if the crown quickly drops from their head_ on which immediately follows the girding of their loins with a girdle_ a badge of servitude_ for servants went with their loins girt. Thus he leads great princes away spoiled of all their power and wealth_ and that in which they pleased and prided themselves_ v,20250223
Those that were honoured and admired strangely fall into disgrace (v. 21): He poureth contempt upon princes. He leaves them to themselves to do mean things_ or alters the opinions of men concerning them. If princes themselves dishonour God and despise him_ if they offer indignities to the people of God and trample upon them_ they shall be lightly esteemed_ and God will pour contempt upon them. See Ps. cvii,20250223
Those that were ready to perish he saved from perishing_ relieving those that were hungry and ready to perish for want_ taking care of those that were sick_ that were outcasts_ that were falsely accused_ or in danger of being turned out of their estates unjustly_ or_ upon any other account_ were ready to perish. The extremity of the peril_ as it quickened Job to appear the more vigorously for them_ so it made his seasonable kindness the more affecting and the more obliging_ and brought their blessings the more abundantly upon him. ,20250223
Those that were strong are strangely weakened_ and it is God that weakens them (v. 21) and overthrows the mighty. v,20250223
Those that were upon any account at a loss Job gave suitable and seasonable relief to (v. 15): I was eyes to the blind_ counselling and advising those for the best that knew not what to do_ and feet to the lame_ assisting those with money and friends that knew what they should do_ but knew not how to compass it. Those we best help whom we help out in that very thing wherein they are defective and most need help. We may come to be blind or lame ourselves_ and therefore should pity and succour those that are so_ Isa. xxxv. 3_ 4; Heb. xii. 13.,20250223
Those that were wise are sometimes strangely infatuated_ and in this the hand of God must be acknowledged (v. 17): He leadeth counsellors away spoiled_ as trophies of his victory over them_ spoiled of all the honour and wealth they have got by their policy_ nay_ spoiled of the wisdom itself for which they have been celebrated and the success they promised themselves in their projects. His counsel stands_ while all their devices are brought to nought and their designs baffled_ and so they are spoiled both of the satisfaction and of the reputation of their wisdom. He maketh the judges fools. By a work on their minds he deprives them of their qualifications for business_ and so they become really fools; and by his disposal of their affairs he makes the issue and event of their projects to be quite contrary to what they themselves intended_ and so he makes them look like fools. The counsel of Ahithophel_ one in whom this scripture was remarkably fulfilled_ became foolishness_ and he_ according to his name_ the brother of a fool. See Isa. xix. 13_ The princes of Zoan have become fools; they have seduced Egypt_ even those that are the stay of the tribes thereof. Let not the wise man therefore glory in his wisdom_ nor the ablest counsellors and judges be proud of their station_ but humbly depend upon God for the continuance of their abilities. Even the aged_ who seem to hold their wisdom by prescription_ and think they have got it by their own industry and therefore have an indefeasible title to it_ may yet be deprived of it_ and often are_ by the infirmities of age_ which make them twice children: He taketh away the understanding of the aged_ v,20250223
Those that will take a liberty to tell lies in discourse are in a fair way to be guilty of the greater wickedness of false-witness-bearing_ whenever they are tempted to it_ though they seemed to detest it. Those that can swallow a false word debauch their consciences_ so that a false oath will not choke them,20250223
Those that with their wisdom have a happy elocution_ that deliver their sentiments easily and with a good grace_ are communicative of their wisdom and have words at will_ and good language as well as good sense_ increase learning; they diffuse and propagate knowledge to others_ and do good work with it_ and by that means increase their own stock. They add doctrine_ improve sciences_ and do service to the commonwealth of learning. To him that has_ and uses what he has_ more shall be given.,20250223
Those that would be good must keep good company_ which is an evidence for them that they would be good (men's character is known by the company they choose) and will be a means of making them good_ of showing them the way and of quickening and encouraging them in it. He that would be himself wise must walk with those that are so_ must choose such for his intimate acquaintance_ and converse with them accordingly; must ask and receive instruction from them_ and keep up pious and profitable talk with them. Miss not the discourse of the elders_ for they also learned of their fathers_ Ecclesiasticus viii,20250223
Those that would be wise in their latter end must hear counsel and receive instruction_ in their beginnings must be willing to be taught and ruled_ willing to be advised and reproved_ when they are young. Those that would be stored in winter must gather in summer.,20250223
Those that would fetch knowledge from the former ages must search diligently_ prepare for the search_ and take pains for the search. ,20250223
Those that would keep their souls must keep a watch before the door of their lips_ must keep the mouth by temperance_ that no forbidden fruit go into it_ no stolen waters_ that nothing be eaten or drunk to excess; they must keep the tongue also_ that no forbidden word go out of the door of the lips_ no corrupt communication. By a constant watchfulness over our words we shall prevent abundance of mischiefs which an ungoverned tongue runs men into. Keep thy heart_ and that will keep thy tongue from sin; keep thy tongue_ and that will keep thy heart from trouble.,20250223
Those that would win souls have need of wisdom to know how to deal with them; and those that do win souls show that they are wise.,20250223
Those that would win souls must contrive how to win upon them with words fitly spoken.,20250223
Those things which God hates it is no thanks to us to hate in others_ but we must hate them in ourselves. 1. Haughtiness_ conceitedness of ourselves_ and contempt of others—a proud look. There are seven things that God hates_ and pride is the first_ because it is at the bottom of much sin and gives rise to it. God sees the pride in the heart and hates it there; but_ when it prevails to that degree that the show of men's countenance witnesses against them that they overvalue themselves and undervalue all about them_ this is in a special manner hateful to him_ for then pride is proud of itself and sets shame at defiance,20250223
Those things which to us seem most casual and contingent are_ in the counsel and foreknowledge of God_ punctually determined_ and the very hour of them is fixed_ and can neither be anticipated nor adjourned a moment.,20250223
Those watchmen were bad enough that could not_ or would not_ assist the spouse in her enquiries after her beloved (ch. iii. 3); but these were much worse_ that hindered her with their severe and uncharitable censures_ smote her and wounded her with their reproaches_ and though they were the keepers of the wall of Jerusalem_ as if they had been the breakers of it_ took away her veil_ from her rudely and barbarously_ as if it had been only a pretence of modesty_ but a cover of the contrary. Those whose outward appearances are all good_ and who yet are invidiously condemned and run down as hypocrites_ have reason to complain_ as the spouse here_ of the taking away of their veil from them. ,20250223
Those were thought happy to whom he spoke_ and they thought themselves so. Never were the dews of heaven so acceptable to the parched ground as his wise discourses were to those that attended on them_ especially to those to whom they were particularly accommodated and directed. His speech dropped upon them_ and they waited for its as for the rain (v. 22_ wondering at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth_ catching at them_ laying hold on them_ and treasuring them up as apophthegms. His servants that stood continually before him to hear his wisdom would not have envied Solomon's. Those are wise_ or are likely to be so_ that know how to value wise discourse_ that wish for it_ and wait for it_ and drink it in as the earth does the rain that comes often upon it_ Heb. vi,20250223
Those who abandon themselves to that sin give proof that they are abandoned of God: it is a deep pit_ which those fall into that are abhorred of the Lord_ who leaves them to themselves to enter into that temptation_ and takes off the bridle of his restraining grace_ to punish them for other sins. Value not thyself upon thy being in favour with such women_ when it proclaims thee under the wrath of God,20250223
Those who are a terror to others cannot but be sometimes a terror to themselves too; but those will be easy who will let others be easy about them; and the reed and fens_ and the willows of the brook_ though a very weak and slender fortification_ yet are sufficient for the defence and security of those who therefore dread no harm_ because they design none.,20250223
Those who are truly convinced of sin_ and penitent for it_ yet have need to be more thoroughly convinced and to be made more deeply penitent. Those who are under convictions_ who have their sins set in order before their eyes and their hearts broken for them_ must learn from this instance not to catch at comfort too soon; it will be everlasting when it comes_ and therefore it is necessary that we be prepared for it by deep humiliation_ that the wound be searched to the bottom and not skinned over_ and that we do not make more haste out of our convictions than good speed. When our hearts begin to melt and relent within us_ let those considerations be dwelt upon and pursued which will help to make a thorough effectual thaw of it.,20250223
Those who believe the word of God can see a curse in the house of the wicked (Prov. iii. though it be ever so finely and firmly built_ and ever so full of all good things; and they can foresee that the curse will_ in time_ infallibly consume it with the timber thereof_ and the stones thereof_ Zech. v,20250223
Those who came to thee for justice_ thou didst send away unheard_ unhelped; nay_ though they came to thee full_ thou didst squeeze them_ and send them away empty; and_ worst of all_ the arms of the fatherless have been broken; those that could help themselves but little thou hast quite disabled to help themselves.__ This which is the blackest part of the charge_ is but insinuated: The arms of the fatherless have been broken. He does not say_ __Thou has broken them___ but he would have it understood so_ and if they be broken_ and those who have power do not relieve them_ they are chargeable with it. __They have been broken by those under thee_ and thou hast connived at it_ which brings thee under the guilt.__ ,20250223
Those who dig into the bowels of the earth_ to rifle the treasures there_ cannot in these dark recesses find this rare jewel_ nor with all their art make themselves masters of it. ,20250223
Those who duly receive what they have heard from God_ and profit by it_ shall hear more from him,20250223
Those who exalt themselves shall certainly be abased: Surely he scorns the scorners. Those who scorn to submit to the discipline of religion_ scorn to take God's yoke upon them_ scorn to be beholden to his grace_ who scoff at godliness and godly people_ and take a pleasure in bantering and exposing them_ God will scorn them_ and lay them open to scorn before all the world. He despises their impotent malice_ sits in heaven and laughs at them_ Ps. ii.,20250223
Those who humble themselves shall be exalted_ for he gives grace to the lowly; he works that in them which puts honour upon them and for which they are accepted of God and approved of men. Those who patiently bear contempt from scornful men shall have respect from God and all good men_ and then they have no reason to envy the scorners or to choose their ways,20250223
Those who make gold their hope will sooner or later be ashamed of it_ and of their confidence in it (Ezek. vii. 19); and the greater their confidence was the greater their shame will be: They were confounded because they had hoped_ v,20250223
Those who read David's psalms_ especially those towards the latter end_ would be tempted to think that religion is all rapture and consists in nothing but the ecstasies and transports of devotion; and doubtless there is a time for them_ and if there be a heaven upon earth it is in them: but_ while we are on earth_ we cannot be wholly taken up with them; we have a life to live in the flesh_ must have a conversation in the world_ and into that we must now be taught to carry our religion_ which is a rational thing_ and very serviceable to the government of human life_ and tends as much to make us discreet as to make us devout_ to make the face shine before men_ in a prudent_ honest_ useful conversation_ as to make the heart burn towards God in holy and pious affections. In this chapter we have_,20250223
Those who take pains about their ground are likely to reap the profit of it. Those who keep that about them which is for use and service_ not for state and show_ more husbandmen than footmen_ are likely to thrive. Much increase is by the strength of the ox; that is made for our service_ and is profitable alive and dead.,20250223
Those who trust to their sinful ways of getting wealth trust in vanity_ and vanity will be their recompence_ for they shall not get what they expected. Their arts will deceive them and perhaps ruin them in this world. ,20250223
Those who trust to their wealth when they have gotten it_ especially to the wealth they have gotten dishonestly_ trust in vanity; for it will yield them no satisfaction. The guilt that cleaves to it will ruin the joy of it. They sow the wind_ and will reap the whirlwind_ and will own at length_ with the utmost confusion_ that a deceived heart turned them aside_ and that they cheated themselves with a lie in their right hand.,20250223
Those whom proud men contrive to crush he raises from under their feet_ and sets them in safety_ Ps. xii,20250223
Those whose hearts are filled with love to Christ_ and hope of heaven_ know best what these things mean.,20250223
Those whose hearts are upright with God_ in walking not after the flesh but after the Spirit_ may be sure that through Christ there shall be no condemnation to them_ but that_ whoever lays any thing to their charge_ they shall be justified: they may know that they shall. ,20250223
Those words are most likely to reach to the hearts of the learners that come from the hearts of the teachers. Those shall teach thee best that utter words out of their heart_ that speak by experience_ and not by rote_ of spiritual and divine things. The learned bishop Patrick suggests that Bildad being a Shuhite_ descended from Shuah one of Abraham's sons by Keturah (Gen. xxv. in this appeal which he makes to history he has a particular respect to the rewards which the blessing of God secured to the posterity of faithful Abraham (who hitherto_ and long after_ continued in his religion) and to the extirpation of those eastern people_ neighbours to Job (in whose country they were settled)_ for their wickedness_ whence he infers that it is God's usual way to prosper the just and root out the wicked_ though for a while they may flourish.,20250223
Thou art all this while making work for repentance_ and laying up matter for vexation and torment in the reflection_ when the sin is set before thee in its own colours.__ Sooner or later it will bring sorrow_ either when the soul is humbled and brought to repentance or when the flesh and body are consumed_ either by sickness_ when conscience flies in the sinner's face_ or by the grave; when the body is rotting there_ the soul is racking in the torments of hell_ where the worm dies not_ and __Son_ remember___ is the constant peal. Solomon here brings in the convinced sinner reproaching himself_ and aggravating his own folly. He will then most bitterly lament it. First_ That because he hated to be reformed he therefore hated to be informed_ and could not endure either to be taught his duty (How have I hated not only the discipline of being instructed_ but the instruction itself_ though all true and good!) or to be told of his faults—My heart despised reproof_ v,20250223
Thou art he whom I came on purpose to seek_ to seek diligently_ came myself_ and would not send a servant.__ Surely he cannot deny her his company when she put such a value upon it_ and would take all this pains to obtain the favour of it. Sinners take pains to do mischief_ and are as the roaring lion himself; they go about seeking to devour_ and yet pretend they are seeking to oblige. ,20250223
Thou hast a mind to reason with God_ and wouldst have us to contend with him on thy behalf; teach us then what we shall say. Canst thou see further into this abyss than we can? If thou canst_ favour us with thy discoveries_ furnish us with instructions.__ 2. He owns his own insufficiency both in speaking to God and in speaking of him: We cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. Note_ The best of men are much in the dark concerning the glorious perfections of the divine nature and the administrations of the divine government. Those that through grace know much of God_ yet know little_ yea_ nothing_ in comparison with what is to be known_ and what will be known_ when that which is perfect shall come and the veil shall be rent. When we would speak of God we speak confusedly and with great uncertainly_ and are soon at a loss and run aground_ not for want of matter_ but for want of words. As we must always begin with fear and trembling_ lest we speak amiss (De Deo etiam vera dicere periculosum est—Even while affirming what is true concerning God we incur risk)_ so we must conclude with shame and blushing_ for having spoken no better. Elihu himself had_ for his part_ spoken well on God's behalf_ and yet is so far from expecting a fee_ or thinking that God was beholden to him for it_ or that he was fit to be standing counsel for him_ that ,20250223
Thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought_ or_ as the LXX. reads it_ Thou hast taken thy brethren for pledges_ and that for nought_ imprisoned them_ enslaved them_ because they had nothing to pay_—that he had taken the very clothes of his insolvent tenants and debtors_ so that he had stripped them naked_ and left them so (the law of Moses forbade this_ Exod. xxii. 26_ Deut. xxiv.,20250223
Thou hast tried my heart towards thee. From this Job infers_ When he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold. Those that keep the way of the Lord may comfort themselves_ when they are in affliction_ with these three things:—,20250223
Thou madest me_ and knowest my strength; wilt thou then suffer me to be pressed above measure? Was I made to be made miserable? Was I preserved only to be reserved for these calamities?__ If we plead this with ourselves as an inducement to duty_ __God made me and maintains me_ and therefore I will serve him and submit to him___ we may plead it with God as an argument for mercy: Thou hast made me_ new—make me; I am thine_ save me. Job knew not how to reconcile God's former favours and his present frowns_ but concludes (v.,20250223
Though Christ has let out his vineyard to keepers_ yet still it is his_ and he has his eye always upon it for good; for_ if he did not watch over it night and day (Isa. xxvii. 1_ the watchmen_ to whom he has let it out_ would keep it but in vain_ Ps. cxxvii.,20250223
Though Jesus Christ be now retired_ he will return. The heavens_ those high mountains of sweet spices_ must contain him till the times of refreshing shall come; and those times will come_ when every eye shall see him_ in all the pomp and power of the upper and better world_ the mystery of God being finished and the mystical body completed,20250223
Though Solomon had commended friendship in adversity (v. yet let not any_ under pretence of being generous to their friends_ be unjust to their families and wrong them; one part of our duty must be made to consist with another. Note,20250223
Though Solomon was a wise man himself_ and divinely inspired_ yet_ when he was to teach wisdom_ he did not think it below him to quote his father and to make use of his words. Those that would learn well_ and teach well_ in religion_ must not affect new-found notions and new-coined phrases_ so as to look with contempt upon the knowledge and language of their predecessors; if we must keep to the good old way_ why should we scorn the good old words? Jer. vi,20250223
Though a man be ever so industrious_ thou he labour to seek it out.,20250223
Though he be ever so ingenious_ though he be a wise man in other things_ and can fathom the counsels of kings themselves and trace them by their footsteps. Nay_ ,20250223
Though he be very confident of success_ though he think to know it_ yet he shall not; he cannot find it out. God's ways are above ours_ nor is he tied to his own former ways_ but his judgments are a great deep.,20250223
Though he keep silence_ and seem to connive at them_ yet he takes notice_ and keeps account of all their wickedness_ and will make it to appear shortly that their most secret sins_ which they thought no eye should see (v. were under his eye and will be called over again. Here is no mention of the punishment of these sinners in the other world_ but it is intimated in the particular notice taken of the consequences of their death. 1. The consumption of the body in the grave_ though common to all_ yet to them is in the nature of a punishment for their sin. The grave shall consume those that have sinned; that land of darkness will be the lot of those that love darkness rather than light. The bodies they pampered shall be a feast for worms_ which shall feed as sweetly on them as ever they fed on the pleasures and gains of their sins,20250223
Though he makes sore the body with sore boils_ the mind with sad thoughts_ yet he binds up at the same time_ as the skilful tender surgeon binds up the wounds he had occasion to make with his incision-knife. When God makes sores by the rebukes of his providence he binds up by the consolations of his Spirit_ which oftentimes abound most as afflictions do abound_ and counterbalance them_ to the unspeakable satisfaction of the patient sufferers. ,20250223
Though he seemed to have withdrawn_ yet he was even then a very present help,20250223
Though he spare it_ and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: 14 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned_ it is the gall of asps within him. 15 He hath swallowed down riches_ and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. 16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him. 17 He shall not see the rivers_ the floods_ the brooks of honey and butter. 18 That which he laboured for shall he restore_ and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be_ and he shall not rejoice therein. 19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away a house which he builded not; 20 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly_ he shall not save of that which he desired. 21 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. 22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.,20250223
Though he spoke to her_ not with the authority_ but with the tenderness of a husband_ did not command_ but entreated her by that conjugal love which their children were the pledges of_ yet she regarded him not. Some read it_ __Though I lamented_ or bemoaned myself_ for the children___ that is_ __for the death of the children of my own body___ an affliction in which she was equally concerned with him. Now_ it appeared_ the devil spared her to him_ not only to be his tempter_ but to be his tormentor. By what she said to him at first_ Curse God and die_ it appeared that she had little religion in her; and what can one expect that is kind and good from those that have not the fear of God before their eyes and are not governed by conscience? ,20250223
Though he takes a great deal of pains_ and goes through all travail_ does not get his estate easily_ but it costs him a great deal of hard labour_ nor does he get it dishonestly_ he wrongs no man_ defrauds no man_ but by every right work_ by applying himself to his own proper business_ and managing it by all the rules of equity and fair dealing_ yet for this he is envied of his neighbour_ and the more for the reputation he has got by his honesty. This shows,20250223
Though he was not of Israel_ he was indeed an Israelite without guile,20250223
Though he wounds_ yet his hands make whole in due time; as he supports his people_ and makes them easy under their afflictions_ so in due time he delivers them_ and makes a way for them to escape. All is well again; and he comforts them according to the time wherein he afflicted them. God's usual method is first to wound and then to heal_ first to convince and then to comfort_ first to humble and then to exalt; and (as Mr. Caryl observes) he never makes a wound too great_ too deep_ for his own cure. Una eademque manus vulnus opemque tulit—The hand that inflicts the wound applies the cure. God tears the wicked and goes away; let those heal that will_ if they can (Hos. v. 14); but the humble and penitent may say_ He has torn and he will heal us_ Hos. vi. 1. This is general_ but_,20250223
Though his children were not doubled to him_ yet in his children's children (and those are the crown of old men) they were more than doubled. As God appointed to Adam another seed instead of that which was slain (Gen. iv.,20250223
Though impenitent sinners do not always fall under such temporal judgments as are here described (therein Zophar was mistaken)_ yet the wrath of God abides upon them_ and they are made miserable by spiritual judgments_ which are much worse_ their consciences being either_ on the one hand_ a terror to them_ and then they are in continual amazement_ or_ on the other hand_ seared and silenced_ and then they are given up to a reprobate sense and bound over to eternal ruin. Never was any doctrine better explained_ or worse applied_ than this by Zophar_ who intended by all this to prove Job a hypocrite. Let us receive the good explication_ and make a better application_ for warning to ourselves to stand in awe and not to sin.,20250223
Though it comes down in drops_ yet it distils upon man abundantly (v. and therefore is called the river of God which is full of water_ Ps. lxv,20250223
Though men may advance themselves by sinful arts_ they cannot by such arts settle and secure themselves; though they may get large estates they cannot get such as will abide: A man shall not be established by wickedness; it may set him in high places_ but they are slippery places_ Ps. lxxiii,20250223
Though now he seemed forsaken of God_ he would yet return to him_ and by degrees would turn his mourning into dancing (Ps. xxx. 11) and comforts should flow in upon him so plentifully that his mouth should be filled with laughing_ v.,20250223
Though she had said the same before_ yet now she inverts the order_ and asserts her interest in her first: I am my beloved's_ entirely devoted and dedicated to him; and then her interest in him and in his grace: __My beloved is mine_ and I am happy_ truly happy in him.__ If our own hearts can but witness for us that we are his_ there is no room left to question his being ours; for the covenant never breaks on his side. ,20250223
Though she is a woman of spirit herself_ yet her desire is to her husband_ to know his mind_ that she may accommodate herself to it_ and she is willing that he should rule over her. ,20250223
Though she needs not work for her bread (she has an estate to live upon)_ yet she will not eat it in idleness_ because she knows that we were none of us sent into this world to be idle_ that when we have nothing to do the devil will soon find us something to do_ and that it is not fit that those who will not labour should eat. Some eat and drink because they can find themselves nothing else to do_ and needless visits must be received with fashionable entertainments; these are eating the bread of idleness_ which she has no relish for_ for she neither gives nor receives idle visits nor idle talk. ,20250223
Though sometimes the rain comes in very small drops_ yet_ at other times_ it pours down in great rain_ and this difference between one shower and another must be resolved into the divine Providence which orders it so. ,20250223
Though the subterraneous wealth is thus hard to obtain_ yet men will have it. He that loves silver is not satisfied with silver_ and yet is not satisfied without it; but those that have much must needs have more. See here,20250223
Though they bring forth their young with a great deal of difficulty and sorrow_ and have no assistance from man_ yet_ by the good providence of God_ their young ones are safely produced_ and their sorrows cast out and forgotten_ v,20250223
Though they may be prolonged (v. 12) beyond what others expected_ yet his day shall come to fall. He shall fall short of everlasting life_ and then his long life on earth will be worth little. ,20250223
Though they prosper in this world_ yet they shall be reckoned with in another world. God rewards him according to his deeds at last (v. though the sentence passed against his evil works be not executed speedily. Perhaps he may not now be made to fear the wrath to come_ but he may flatter himself with hopes that he shall have peace though he go on; but he shall be made to feel it in the day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God. He shall know it (v. 20): His eyes shall see his destruction which he would not be persuaded to believe. They will not see_ but they shall see_ Isa.,20250223
Though they spend all their days in wealth God is laying up their iniquity for their children (v. and he will visit it upon their posterity when they are gone. The oppressor lays up his goods for his children_ to make them gentlemen_ but God lays up his iniquity for them_ to make them beggars. He keeps an exact account of the fathers' sins_ seals them up among his treasures (Deut. xxxii. and will justly punish the children_ while the riches_ to which the curse cleaves_ are found as assets in their hands,20250223
Though they thought to make themselves a great name by their wealth_ and power_ and mighty achievements_ yet their memorial perished with them_ Ps. ix,20250223
Though they trifled and made nothing of it_ though none of them answered Job's words nor said what was proper to convince him_ yet he attended to them_ in hopes they would bring it to some head at last. We must often be willing to hear what we do not like_ else we cannot prove all things. His patient attendance on their discourses he pleads_ ,20250223
Though they were slow_ and took up a great deal of time in searching out what to say. Though they had often to seek for matter and words_ paused and hesitated_ and were unready at their work_ yet he overlooked that_ and gave ear to their reasons_ which_ if really convincing_ he would not think the less so for the disadvantages of the delivery of them. ,20250223
Though this is a mystery of Providence_ yet there is a reason for it_ and we shall shortly know why the judgment is deferred; even the wisest_ and those who know God best_ do not yet see it. God will exercise their faith and patience_ and excite their prayers for the coming of his kingdom_ for which they are to cry day and night to him_ Luke xviii. 7.,20250223
Though we come into the world naked_ yet the body is itself both clothed and armed. The skin and flesh are its clothing; the bones and sinews are its armour_ not offensive_ but defensive. The vital parts_ the heart and lungs_ are thus clothed_ not to be seen—thus fenced_ not to be hurt. The admirable structure of human bodies is an illustrious instance of the wisdom_ power_ and goodness of the Creator. What a pity is it that these bodies should be instruments of unrighteousness which are capable of being temples of the Holy Ghost! ,20250223
Though_ for a small moment_ and in a little wrath_ he had hid his face from her_ yet now he gathers her with very surprising instances of everlasting lovingkindness_ Isa. liv,20250223
Three sorts of clouds he here speaks of:—1. Close_ black_ thick clouds_ pregnant with showers; and these with watering he wearies (v. that is_ they spend themselves_ and are exhausted by the rain into which they melt and are dissolved_ pouring out water till they are weary and can pour out no more. See what pains_ as I may say_ the creatures_ even those above us_ take to serve man: the clouds water the earth till they are weary; they spend and are spent for our benefit_ which shames and condemns us for the little good we do in our places_ though it would be to our own advantage_ for he that watereth shall be watered also himself,20250223
Three things he would have them consider:—,20250223
Three things here apologize for Elihu's interposing as he does in this controversy which had already been canvassed by such acute and learned disputants:—,20250223
Three things she admires him for:—,20250223
Three things the prophet here aims at:—,20250223
Through pride and conceitedness: Seest thou a man that is forward to speak to every matter that is started_ and affects to speak first to it_ to open it_ and speak last to it_ to give judgment upon it_ as if he were an oracle? There is more hope of a modest fool_ who is sensible of his folly_ than of such a self-conceited one.,20250223
Thunder and lightning happen usually in the summer_ but here he takes notice of the winter-weather. Then he saith to the snow_ Be thou on the earth; he commissions it_ he commands it_ he appoints it_ where it shall light and how long it shall lie. He speaks_ and it is done: as in the creation of the world_ Let there be light_ so in the works of common providence_ Snow_ be thou on the earth. Saying and doing are not two things with God_ though they are with us. When he speaks the word the small rain distils and the great rain pours down as he pleases—the winter-rain (so the LXX.)_ for in those countries_ when the winter was past_ the rain was over and gone_ Cant. ii,20250223
Thunder and lightning_ which usually go together_ are sensible indications of the glory and majesty_ the power and terror_ of Almighty God_ one to the ear and the other to the eye; in these God leaves not himself without witness of his greatness_ as_ in the rain from heaven and fruitful seasons_ he leaves not himself without witness of his goodness (Acts xiv. even to the most stupid and unthinking. Though there are natural causes and useful effects of them_ which the philosophers undertake to account for_ yet they seem chiefly designed by the Creator to startle and awaken the slumbering world of mankind to the consideration of a God above them. The eye and the ear are the two learning senses; and therefore_ though such a circumstance is possible_ they say it was never known in fact that any one was born both blind and deaf. By the word of God divine instructions are conveyed to the mind through the ear_ by his works through the eye; but_ because those ordinary sights and sounds do not duly affect men_ God is pleased sometimes to astonish men by the eye with his lightnings and by the ear with his thunder. It is very probable that at this time_ when Elihu was speaking_ it thundered and lightened_ for he speaks of the phenomena as present; and_ God being about to speak (ch. xxxviii. 1)_ these were_ as afterwards on Mount Sinai_ the proper prefaces to command attention and awe. Observe here,20250223
Thus Christ said of the Pharisees_ Let them alone_ Matt. xv,20250223
Thus Eliphaz proves that a man cannot be profitable to God (v. that he ought not to contend with God (it is his folly if he does)_ and that we ought always to address ourselves to God with very great reverence; for when we behold the height of the stars_ how high they are_ we should_ at the same time_ also consider the transcendent majesty of God_ who is above the stars_ and how high he is.,20250223
Thus Satan still endeavours to draw men from God_ as he did our first parents_ by suggesting hard thoughts of him_ as one that envies the happiness and delights in the misery of his creatures_ than which nothing is more false. Another artifice he uses is to drive men from their religion by loading them with scoffs and reproaches for their adherence to it. We have reason to expect it_ but we are fools if we heed it. Our Master himself has undergone it_ we shall be abundantly recompensed for it_ and with much more reason may we retort it upon the scoffers_ __Are you such fools as still to retain your impiety_ when you might bless God and live?__ 2. She urges him to renounce his religion_ to blaspheme God_ set him at defiance_ and dare him to do his worst: __Curse God and die; live no longer in dependence upon God_ wait not for relief from him_ but be thy own deliverer by being thy own executioner; end thy troubles by ending thy life; better die once than be always dying thus; thou mayest now despair of having any help from thy God_ even curse him_ and hang thyself.__ These are two of the blackest and most horrid of all Satan's temptations_ and yet such as good men have sometimes been violently assaulted with. Nothing is more contrary to natural conscience than blaspheming God_ nor to natural sense than self-murder; therefore the suggestion of either of these may well be suspected to come immediately from Satan. Lord_ lead us not into temptation_ not into such_ not into any temptation_ but deliver us from the evil one.,20250223
Thus are the revolutions of kingdoms wonderfully brought about by an overruling Providence. Heaven and earth are shaken_ but the Lord sits King for ever_ and with him we look for a kingdom that cannot be shaken.,20250223
Thus did he humble himself under the mighty hand of God_ and bring his mind to the meanness and poverty of his condition. He complains (ch. vii. 5) that his flesh was clothed with worms and clods of dust; and therefore dust to dust_ ashes to ashes. If God lay him among the ashes_ there he will contentedly sit down. A low spirit becomes low circumstances_ and will help to reconcile us to them. The LXX. reads it_ He sat down upon a dunghill without the city (which is commonly said_ in mentioning this story); but the original says no more than that he sat in the midst of the ashes_ which he might do in his own house.,20250223
Thus great_ thus noble_ thus truly excellent_ is the subject_ and thus capable of being improved_ which gives me the more reason to be ashamed of the meanness of my performance_ that the comment breathes so little of the life and spirit of the text. We often wonder at those that are not at all affected with the great things of God_ and have no taste nor relish of them_ because they know little of them; but perhaps we have more reason to wonder at ourselves_ that conversing so frequently_ so intimately_ with them_ we are not more affected with them_ so as even to be wholly taken up with them_ and in a continual transport of delight in the contemplation of them. We hope to be so shortly; in the mean time_ though like the three disciples that were the witnesses of Christ's transfiguration upon the mount we are but dull and sleepy_ yet we can say_ Master_ it is good to be here; here let us make tabernacles_ Luke ix. 32_ 33.,20250223
Thus his own iniquities having seized the wicked himself by his own consent_ and he having voluntarily surrendered himself a captive to them_ he is held in the cords of his own sins_ and such full possession they have gained of him that he cannot extricate himself_ but in the greatness of his folly (and what greater folly could there be than to yield himself a servant to such cruel task-masters?) he shall go astray_ and wander endlessly. Uncleanness is a sin from which_ when once men have plunged themselves into it_ they very hardly and very rarely recover themselves,20250223
Thus his retinue was enlarged and his court appeared more magnificent. See Ezra ii. 58.,20250223
Thus shall the remainder of wrath be restrained. ,20250223
Thus should we feed upon wisdom_ and relish the good instructions of it. Those that have tasted honey need no further proof that it is sweet_ nor can they by any argument be convinced of the contrary; so those that have experienced the power of truth and godliness are abundantly satisfied of the pleasure of both; they have tasted the sweetness of them_ and all the atheists in the world with their sophistry_ and the profane with their banter_ cannot alter their sentiments,20250223
Thus the poor are repaid_ the charitable are encouraged_ and God is glorified.,20250223
Thus the words of Job are ended; that is_ he has now said all he would say in answer to his friends: he afterwards said something in a way of self-reproach and condemnation (ch. xl. 4_ 5_ xlii. 2_ &c.)_ but here ends what he had to say in a way of self-defence and vindication. If this suffice not he will say no more; he knows when he has said enough and will submit to the judgment of the bench. Some think the manner of expression intimates that he concluded with an air of assurance and triumph. He now keeps the field and doubts not but to win the field. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies.,20250223
Thy hands have made me and fashioned me_ Ps. cxix. 73. So here_ Thou madest me; and wilt thou destroy me (v.,20250223
Thy plants_ or plantations_ are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits_ v,20250223
Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins_ which feed among the lilies. 6 Until the day break_ and the shadows flee away_ I will get me to the mountain of myrrh_ and to the hill of frankincense. 7 Thou art all fair_ my love; there is no spot in thee.,20250223
Time and chance happen to them all. A sovereign Providence breaks men's measures_ and blasts their hopes_ and teaches them that the way of man is not in himself_ but subject to the divine will. We must use means_ but not trust to them; if we succeed_ we must give God the praise (Ps. xliv. 3); if we be crossed_ we must acquiesce in his will and take our lot.,20250223
Time does not wear out the guilt of sin. ,20250223
Time hastens on apace; the motion of it cannot be stopped_ and_ when it is past_ it cannot be recalled. While we are living_ as we are sowing (Gal. vi. so we are weaving. Every day_ like the shuttle_ leaves a thread behind it. Many weave the spider's web_ which will fail them_ ch. viii,20250223
Time was when the secret of God was with him_ but now his communication with heaven was cut off_ ver. 20-22.,20250223
To Job's own knowledge and conviction: __Knowest thou not this? Canst thou be ignorant of a truth so plain? Or canst thou doubt of a truth which has been confirmed by the suffrages of all mankind?__ Those know little who do not know that the wages of sin is death. ,20250223
To acknowledge the goodness of God in ordering it so that a creature of such bulk_ which requires so much food_ should not feed upon flesh (for then multitudes must die to keep him alive)_ but should be content with the grass of the field_ to prevent such destruction of lives as otherwise must have ensued. ,20250223
To acquiesce in Solomon's judgment of the things of this world_ and not to think of repeating the trial; for we can never think of having such advantages as he had to make the experiment nor of being able to make it with equal application of mind and so little danger to ourselves.,20250223
To admire the wisdom and power of the Creator in the smallest and most despicable animals_ in an ant as much as in an elephant,20250223
To advance Jesus Christ_ and the Father in him (v. 4): Who ascended up into heaven_ &c.,20250223
To aggravate the apostasy and misery of that wicked spirit: __How unlike him are thou!__ Note_ The holiness and happiness of the saints are the shame and torment of the devil and the devil's children. ,20250223
To answer the devil's seeming boast of the interest he had in this earth. __I have been walking to and fro in it___ says he_ __and it is all my own; all flesh have corrupted their way; they all sit still_ and are at rest in their sins___ Zech. i. 10_ 11. __Nay_ hold___ saith God_ __Job is my faithful servant.__ Satan may boast_ but he shall not triumph. ,20250223
To anticipate his accusations_ as if he had said_ __Satan_ I know thy errand; thou hast come to inform against Job; but hast thou considered him? Does not his unquestionable character give thee the lie?__ Note_ God knows all the malice of the devil and his instruments against his servants; and we have an advocate ready to appear for us_ even before we are accused.,20250223
To assuage their grief—the causes of their grief_ if possible_ or at least their resentment of those causes. Good words cost nothing; but they may be of good service to those that are in sorrow_ not only as it is some comfort to them to see their friends concerned for them_ but as they may be so reminded of that which_ through the prevalency of grief_ was forgotten. Though hard words (we say) break no bones_ yet kind words may help to make broken bones rejoice; and those have the tongue of the learned that know how to speak a word in season to the weary.,20250223
To assure us of the truth of the word of God_ and to recommend it to us_ v. 5_ 6. Agur's pupils expect to be instructed by him in the things of God. __Alas!__ says he_ __I cannot undertake to instruct you; go to the word of God; see what he has there revealed of himself_ and of his mind and will; you need know no more than what that will teach you_ and that you may rely upon as sure and sufficient. Every word of God is pure; there is not the least mixture of falsehood and corruption in it.__ The words of men are to be heard and read with jealousy and with allowance_ but there is not the least ground to suspect any deficiency in the word of God; it is as silver purified seven times,20250223
To balance his losses. He suffered for the glory of God_ and therefore God made it up to him with advantage_ and allowed him more than interest upon interest. God will take care that none shall lose by him. ,20250223
To be angry at those who unjustly censure and condemn their brethren. For aught I know_ Eliphaz_ in accusing Job falsely_ as he does here_ was guilty of as great a sin and as great a wrong to Job as the Sabeans and Chaldeans that robbed him; for a man's good name is more precious and valuable than his wealth. It is against all the laws of justice_ charity_ and friendship_ either to raise or receive calumnies_ jealousies_ and evil surmises_ concerning others; and it is the more base and disingenuous if we thus vex those that are in distress and add to their affliction. Eliphaz could produce no instances of Job's guilt in any of the particulars that follow here_ but seems resolved to calumniate boldly_ and throw all the reproach he could on Job_ not doubting but that some would cleave to him,20250223
To be cautious in making our vows. This is necessary in order to our being conscientious in performing them_ v,20250223
To be charitable to the poor and necessitous. If others want the necessary supports of life_ and we have wherewithal to supply them_ we must look upon it as due to them and not withhold it. Alms are called righteousness because they are a debt to the poor_ and a debt which we must not defer to pay_ Bis dat_ qui cito dat—He gives twice who gives speedily.,20250223
To be diligent in our business and provide well for our families_ ver. 18_ 19,20250223
To be importunate in our requests. We are allowed_ not only to pray_ but to plead_ not only to ask_ but to argue; nay_ to fill our mouths with arguments_ not to move God (he is perfectly apprized of the merits of the cause without our showing)_ but to move ourselves_ to excite our fervency and encourage our faith in prayer.,20250223
To be particular in our requests_ to order our cause before God_ to speak the whole matter_ to lay before him all our grievances_ in what method we think most proper; we durst not be so free with earthly princes as a humble holy soul may be with God. ,20250223
To be ready to all acts of friendship and humanity_ and in every thing to be neighbourly; for these are things that are due by the law of doing as we would be done by,20250223
To be submissive to our superiors if at any time we have offended them_ ver. 4,20250223
To be well beloved_ to have an interest in the esteem and affections of all about us; this is better than silver and gold. Christ has neither silver nor gold_ but he grew in favour with God and man_ Luke ii,20250223
To be willing to die_ to come cheerfully to the grave_ and not to be forced thither_ as he whose soul was required of him.,20250223
To blame ourselves who do not act so much for our own true interest as the meanest creatures do for theirs,20250223
To bless God that we are not in such a disconsolate condition as poor Job was here in_ but that we walk in the light of the Lord; let us rejoice therein_ but rejoice with trembling.,20250223
To break the dazzling force he draws a screen,20250223
To comfort the spouse_ who_ they knew_ would recover new spirits if she did but talk awhile of her beloved; nothing would please her better_ nor give a more powerful diversion to her grief_ than to be put upon the pleasing task of describing the beauties of her beloved.,20250223
To comfort weak believers_ who are discouraged by their own blackness; let them be told again and again that they are fair,20250223
To commend a quiet and peaceable life. Who would not rather_ like the elephant_ have his neighbours easy and pleasant about him_ than_ like the lion_ have them all afraid of him?,20250223
To commend living upon herbs and fruits without flesh_ according to the original appointment of man's food_ Gen. i,20250223
To convince Job of God's power and terrible majesty several particular instances are here given of the strength and terror of the leviathan_ which is no more than what God has given him_ nor more than he has under his check_ ver. 11_ 12. The face of the leviathan is here described to be terrible (ver. 12_ his scales close (ver. 15-17)_ his breath and neesings sparkling (ver. 18-21)_ his flesh firm (ver. 22-24)_ his strength and spirit_ when he is attacked_ insuperable (ver. 25-30)_ his motions turbulent_ and disturbing to the waters (ver. 31_ so that_ upon the whole_ he is a very terrible creature_ and man is no match for him_ ver. 33_ 34.,20250223
To convince Job of his fault and folly in quarrelling with God. We must not pretend to pass a judgment upon his works_ for they are unsearchable and above our enquiries; nor must we strive with our Maker_ for he will certainly be too hard for us_ and is able to crush us in a moment. ,20250223
To depart from evil is understanding,20250223
To deter and draw us off from iniquity for the future.,20250223
To die is to go the way whence we shall not return. It is to go a journey_ a long journey_ a journey for good and all_ to remove from this to another country_ from the world of sense to the world of spirits. It is a journey to our long home; there will be no coming back to out state in this world nor any change of our state in the other world,20250223
To die seasonably_ as the corn is cut and housed when it is fully ripe; not till then_ but then not suffered to stand a day longer_ lest it shed. Our times are in God's hand; it is well they are so_ for he will take care that those who are his shall die in the best time: however their death may seem to us untimely_ it will be found not unseasonable.,20250223
To die_ and be buried in a great deal of pomp and magnificence_ v. 32_ 33. There is no remedy; he must die; that is the lot of all men; but every thing you can think of shall be done to take off the reproach of death. First_ He shall have a splendid funeral—a poor thing for any man to be proud of the prospect of; yet with some it passes for a mighty thing. Well_ he shall be brought to the grave in state_ surrounded with all the honours of the heralds' office and all the respect his friends can then pay to his remains. The rich man died_ and was buried_ but no mention is made of the poor man's burial_ Luke xvi,20250223
To direct us what we must have in our eye in conversation_ namely to improve both others and ourselves_ not to pass away time or banter one another_ but to provoke one another to love and to good works and so to make one another wiser and better.,20250223
To discover past sins to us_ and to bring them to our remembrance. Then he shows them that amiss in them which before they did not see. He discovers to them the fact of sin: He shows them their work. Sin is our own work. If there be any good in us_ it is God's work; and we are concerned to see what work we have made by sin. He discovers the fault of sin_ shows them their transgressions of the law of God_ and withal the sinfulness of sin_ that they have exceeded_ and have been beyond measure sinful. True penitents lay a load upon themselves_ do not extenuate_ but aggravate_ their sins_ and own that they have exceeded in them. Affliction sometimes answers to the sin; it serves_ however_ to awaken the conscience and puts men upon considering. ,20250223
To dispose our hearts to receive present instructions: Then he opens their ear to discipline_ v,20250223
To distinguish between truth and falsehood_ good and evil—to perceive the words of understanding_ to apprehend them_ to judge of them_ to guard against mistakes_ and to accommodate what we are taught to ourselves and our own use_ that we may discern things that differ and not be imposed upon_ and may approve things that are excellent and not lose the benefit of them_ as the apostle prays_ Phil.,20250223
To encourage Job to seek unto God_ and to refer his cause to him. What more encouraging than to see that he is one to whom power belongs? He can do great things and marvellous for our relief_ when we are brought ever so low.,20250223
To encourage the love-sick soul to continue waiting till he returns: __For_ in the mean time_ his right hand embraces me_ and thereby gives me an unquestionable assurance of his love.__ Believers owe all their strength and comfort to the supporting left hand and embracing right hand of the Lord Jesus.,20250223
To enforce his prayer for pardon he pleads the prospect he had of dying quickly: For now shall I sleep in the dust. Death will lay us in the dust_ will lay us to sleep there_ and perhaps presently_ now in a little time. Job had been complaining of restless nights_ and that sleep departed from his eyes (v. 3_ 4_ 13_ 14); but those who cannot sleep on a bed of down will shortly sleep in a bed of dust_ and not be scared with dreams nor tossed to and fro: __Thou shalt seek me in the morning_ to show me favour_ but I shall not be; it will be too late then. If my sins be not pardoned while I live_ I am lost and undone for ever.__ Note_ The consideration of this_ that we must shortly die_ and perhaps may die suddenly_ should make us all very solicitous to get our sins pardoned and our iniquity taken away.,20250223
To engage all who are sanctified to be very thankful for that grace which has made them fair_ who by nature were deformed_ and changed the Ethiopian's skin. One instance of the beauty of the spouse is here mentioned_ that she has doves' eyes_ as ch. iv. 1. Those are fair_ in Christ's account_ who have_ not the piercing eye of the eagle_ but the pure and chaste eye of the dove_ not like the hawk_ who_ when he soars upwards_ still has his eye upon the prey on earth_ but a humble modest eye_ such an eye as discovers a simplicity and godly sincerity and a dove-like innocency_ eyes enlightened and guided by the Holy Spirit_ that blessed Dove_ weeping eyes. I did mourn as a dove_ Ezek. vii. 16.,20250223
To engage us to persevere in our duty. They are as nails to those that are wavering and inconstant_ to fix them to that which is good. They are as goads to such as are dull and draw back_ and nails to such as are desultory and draw aside_ means to establish the heart and confirm good resolutions_ that we may not sit loose to our duty_ nor even be taken off from it_ but that what good there is in us may be as a nail fastened in a sure place_ Ezra ix,20250223
To excite us to our duty. They are as goads to the ox that draws the plough_ putting him forward when he is dull and quickening him_ to amend his pace. The truths of God prick men to the heart (Acts ii. 37) and put them upon bethinking themselves_ when they trifle and grow remiss_ and exerting themselves with more vigour in their work. While our good affections are so apt as they are to grow flat and cool_ we have need of these goads. ,20250223
To expose his folly_ and the great absurdity of a voluptuous vicious course of life. The very description of it_ if men would see things entirely_ and judge of them impartially_ is enough to show how contrary to reason those act that live such a life. The very opening of the cause is enough to determine it_ without any argument. ,20250223
To feed among the gardens_ to feed his flock_ which he feeds not_ as other shepherds_ in the open fields_ but in his garden_ so well are they provided for_ Ps. xxiii,20250223
To form right notions of things_ and to possess our minds with clear and distinct ideas of them_ that we may know wisdom and instruction_ that wisdom which is got by instruction_ by divine revelation_ may know both how to speak and act wisely ourselves and to give instruction to others,20250223
To gather lilies_ wherewith he is pleased to entertain and adorn himself. He picks the lilies one by one_ and gathers them to himself; and there will be a general harvest of them at the great day_ when he will send forth his angels_ to gather all his lilies_ that he may be for ever glorified and admired in them.,20250223
To get knowledge by them. Some are very able and fit to give counsel_ having an excellent faculty of cleaving a hair_ hitting the joint of a difficulty_ and advising pertinently_ but they are modest_ and reserved_ and not communicative; they have a great deal in them_ but it is loth to come out. In such a case a man of understanding will draw it out_ as wine out of a vessel. We lose the benefit we might have by the conversation of wise men for want of the art of being inquisitive.,20250223
To get the knowledge of them. Though men's counsels and designs are ever so carefully concealed by them_ so that they are as deep water which one cannot fathom_ yet there are those who by sly insinuations_ and questions that seem foreign_ will get out of them both what they have done and what they intend to do. Those therefore who would keep counsel must not only put on resolution_ but stand upon their guard,20250223
To give subtilty to the simple_ to the young man knowledge and discretion,20250223
To give wages to those who have earned them,20250223
To govern our tongues well_ ver. 12-15,20250223
To gratify his smell_ it is perfumed with the sweetest scents_ v,20250223
To hate all sin_ as displeasing to God and destructive to the soul: The fear of the Lord is to hate evil_ the evil way_ to hate sin as sin_ and therefore to hate every false way. Wherever there is an awe of God there is a dread of sin_ as an evil_ as only evil,20250223
To hate lying_ and to keep at the utmost distance from it_ because it is an abomination to the Lord_ and renders those abominable in his sight that allow themselves in it_ not only because it is a breach of his law_ but because it is destructive to human society,20250223
To have them always at heart; for it is in that treasury_ the hidden man of the heart_ that we must keep sound wisdom and discretion_ keep to the principles of it and keep in the ways of it. It is wealth that is worth keeping.,20250223
To hear God speaking to him by his word_ and return an answer: Call thou_ and I will answer; or_ ,20250223
To her own conscience (if she have any left) she denies the fault_ and will not own that that great wickedness is any wickedness at all_ but an innocent entertainment. See Hos. xii. 7_ 8. Thus multitudes ruin their souls by calling evil good and out-facing their convictions with a self-justification.,20250223
To how great a degree a good man will be merciful; he has not only a compassion for the human nature under its greatest abasements_ but he regards even the life of his beast_ not only because it is his servant_ but because it is God's creature_ and in conformity to Providence_ which preserves man and beast. The beasts that are under our care must be provided for_ must have convenient food and rest_ must in no case be abused or tyrannised over. Balaam was checked for beating his ass. The law took care for oxen. Those therefore are unrighteous men that are not just to the brute-creatures; those that are furious and barbarous to them evidence_ and confirm in themselves_ a habit of barbarity_ and help to make the creation groan_ Rom. viii. 22,20250223
To how great a degree a wicked man will be unmerciful; even his tender mercies are cruel; that natural compassion which is in him_ as a man_ is lost_ and_ by the power of corruption_ is turned into hard-heartedness; even that which they will have to pass for compassion is really cruel_ as Pilate's resolution concerning Christ the innocent_ I will chastise him and let him go. Their pretended kindnesses are only a cover for purposed cruelties.,20250223
To humble himself before God for his sins_ and to accept the punishment of them: __I have borne chastisement. What I suffer comes justly upon me_ and therefore I will bear it_ and not only justify God in it_ but acknowledge his goodness.__ Many are chastised that do not bear chastisement_ do not bear it well_ and so_ in effect_ do not bear it at all. Penitents_ if sincere_ will take all well that God does_ and will bear chastisement as a medicinal operation intended for good,20250223
To humble them and lay them low. They thought that they only were the favourites of Heaven_ and that Job had no interest there; but God gives them to understand that he had a better interest there than they had_ and stood fairer for God's acceptance than they did. The day may come when those who despise and censure God's people will court their favour_ and be made to know that God has loved them_ Rev. iii,20250223
To increase the difficulty. It is strange that any wicked people should prosper thus_ but especially that those should prosper who have arrived at such a pitch of wickedness as openly to bid defiance to God himself_ and tell him to his face that they care not for him; nay_ and that their prosperity should be continued_ though they bear up themselves upon that_ in their opposition to God; with that weapon they fight against him_ and yet are not disarmed. Or_ ,20250223
To inform themselves; they had heard_ in general_ that he was excellent and glorious_ but they desired to know more particularly. They wondered what moved the spouse to charge them concerning her beloved with so much vehemence and concern_ and therefore concluded there must be something more in him than in another beloved_ which they are willing to be convinced of. Then there begin to be some hopes of people when they begin to enquire concerning Christ and his transcendent perfections. And sometimes the extraordinary zeal of one_ in enquiring after Christ_ may be a means to provoke many (2 Cor. ix. as the apostle_ by the faith of the Gentiles_ would stir up the Jews to a holy emulation_ Rom. xi,20250223
To keep men from ruin_ v. 18. While sinners are pursuing their evil purposes_ and indulging their pride_ their souls are hastening apace to the pit_ to the sword_ to destruction_ both in this world and that to come; but when God_ by the admonitions of conscience_ withdraws them from sin_ he thereby keeps back their souls from the pit_ from the bottomless pit_ and saves them from perishing by the sword of divine vengeance_ so iniquity shall not be their ruin. That which turns men from sin saves them from hell_ saves a soul from death_ James v,20250223
To keep thee from the strange woman; that is it he aims at; only there he had said_ Keep thy father's commandment_ here (which comes all to one)_ Keep my commandments_ for he speaks to us as unto sons. He speaks in God's name; for it is God's commandments that we are to keep_ his words_ his law. The word of God must be to us,20250223
To keep them from choosing the path of life_ to prevent them from being religious and from going to heaven_ that_ being himself shut out from happiness_ he may keep them out from it. ,20250223
To keep up the fear of God_ v,20250223
To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding,20250223
To lessen the difficulty. God suffers them to prosper; but let us not wonder at it_ for the prosperity of fools destroys them_ by hardening them in sin_ Prov. i. 32; Ps. lxxiii. 7-9.,20250223
To live in a great deal of power_ so as to be not only the terror of the mighty in the land of the living (Ezek. xxxii. but the terror of the wise and good too_ whom he keeps in such awe that none dares declare his way to his face_ v,20250223
To live quiet and peaceable lives_ and not to meddle with those that are factious and seditious_ and are endeavouring to disturb the government and the public repose_ the folly and danger of which disloyal and turbulent practices he shows_ ver. 8-11,20250223
To live to a full age_ and not to have the number of our months cut off in the midst. If the providence of God do not give us long life_ yet_ if the grace of God give us to be satisfied with the time allotted us_ we may be said to come to a full age. That man lives long enough that has done his work and is fit for another world. ,20250223
To make a collection for him_ to set him up again in the world. Though he could plead that his losses came upon him by the hand of God and not by any fault or folly of his own_—that he was utterly ruined and impoverished_—that he had lived in good condition_ and that when he had wherewithal he was charitable and ready to help those that were in distress_—that his friends were rich_ and able to help him_ yet he did not say_ Give me of your substance. Note_ A good man_ when troubled himself_ is afraid of being troublesome to his friends. Or_ 2. To raise the country for him_ to help him to recover his cattle out of the hands of the Sabeans and Chaldeans_ or to make reprisals upon them: __Did I send for you to deliver me out of the hand of the mighty? No_ I never expected you should either expose yourselves to any danger or put yourselves to any charge upon my account. I will rather sit down content under my affliction_ and make the best of it_ than sponge upon my friends.__ St. Paul worked with his hands_ that he might not be burdensome to any. Job's not asking their help did not excuse them from offering it when he needed it and it was in the power of their hands to give it; but it much aggravated their unkindness when he desired no more from them than a good look_ and a good word_ and yet could not obtain them. It often happens that from man_ even when we expect little_ we have less_ but from God_ even when we expect much_ we have more_ Eph. iii. 20.,20250223
To make conscience of truth_ not only in our words_ but in all our actions_ because those that deal truly and sincerely in all their dealings are his delight_ and he is well pleased with them. We delight to converse with_ and make use of_ those that are honest and that we may put a confidence in; such therefore let us be_ that we may recommend ourselves to the favour both of God and man.,20250223
To make good the inference_ he maintains that man's wickedness is that which always brings God's judgments_ ver. 7-11.,20250223
To make kings wise and considerate in dispensing their frowns and smiles. They are not like those of common persons; their frowns are very terrible and their smiles very comfortable_ and therefore it concerns them to be very careful that they never frighten a good man from doing well with their frowns_ nor ever give countenance to a wicked man in doing ill with their smiles_ for then they abuse their influence_ Rom. xiii. 3,20250223
To make subjects faithful and dutiful to their princes. Let them be restrained from all disloyalty by the consideration of the dreadful consequence of having the government against them; and let them be encouraged in all good services to the public by the hopes of the favour of their prince. Christ is a King whose wrath against his enemies will be as the roaring of a lion (Rev. x. 3) and his favour to his own people as the refreshing dew_ Ps. lxxii. 6.,20250223
To make up the many deficiencies in the comfort of human life: That which is wanting there cannot be numbered_ or counted out to us from the treasures of human learning_ but what is wanting will still be so. All our enjoyments here_ when we have done our utmost to bring them to perfection_ are still lame and defective_ and it cannot be helped; as they are_ so they are likely to be. That which is wanting in our knowledge is so much that it cannot be numbered. The more we know the more we see of our own ignorance. Who can understand his errors_ his defects?,20250223
To many it proves a gift. God gives it to men_ as the physician gives a medicine to his patient_ to do him good. This travail is given to us to make us weary of the world and desirous of the remaining rest. It is given to us that we may be kept in action_ and may always have something to do; for we were none of us sent into the world to be idle. Every change cuts us out some new work_ which we should be more solicitous about_ than about the event.,20250223
To men like ourselves we are in a capacity either of doing injury or of showing kindness; and in both these the sovereign Lord and Judge of all will interest himself_ will reward those that do good and punish those that do hurt to their fellow-creatures and fellow-subjects. But_ ,20250223
To oblige them to make their peace with Job_ as the condition of their making their peace with God. If thy brother has aught against thee (as Job had a great deal against them)_ first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift. Satisfaction must first be made for wrong done_ according as the nature of the thing requires_ before we can hope to obtain from God the forgiveness of sin. See how thoroughly God espoused the cause of his servant Job and engaged in it. God will not be reconciled to those that have offended Job till they have first begged his pardon and he be reconciled to them. Job and his friends had differed in their opinion about many things_ and had been too keen in their reflections one upon another_ but now they were to be made friends; in order to that_ they are not to argue the matter over again and try to give it a new turn (that might be endless)_ but they must agree in a sacrifice and a prayer_ and that must reconcile them: they must unite in affection and devotion when they could not concur in the same sentiments. Those who differ in judgments about minor things are yet one in Christ the great sacrifice_ and meet at the same throne of grace_ and therefore ought to love and bear with one another. Once more_ observe_ When God was angry with Job's friends_ he did himself put them in a way to make their peace with him. Our quarrels with God always begin on our part_ but the reconciliation begins on his.,20250223
To obviate his friends' censures of him_ he makes a very ample and particular protestation of his own integrity notwithstanding. In this chapter he looks back to the days of his prosperity_ and shows,20250223
To oppose sin and to confront the corrupt and pernicious inferences which evil men would draw from Job's sufferings_ as that God has forsaken the earth_ that it is in vain to serve him_ and the like: The innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite_ will not bear to hear this (Rev. ii. but will withstand him to his face_ will stir up himself to search into the meaning of such providences and study these hard chapters_ that he may read them readily_ will stir up himself to maintain religion's just but injured cause against all its opposers. Note_ The boldness of the attacks which profane people make upon religion should sharpen the courage and resolution of its friends and advocates. It is time to stir when proclamation is made in the gate of the camp_ Who is on the Lord's side? When vice is daring it is no time for virtue_ through fear_ to hide itself. ,20250223
To order our conversation aright in every things_ This book will give_ that we may receive_ the instruction of wisdom_ that knowledge which will guide our practice in justice_ judgment_ and equity (v. which will dispose us to render to all their due_ to God the things that are God's_ in all the exercises of religion_ and to all men what is due to them_ according to the obligations which by relation_ office_ contract_ or upon any other account_ we lie under to them. Note_ Those are truly wise_ and none but those_ who are universally conscientious; and the design of the scripture is to teach us that wisdom_ justice in the duties of the first table_ judgment in those of the second table_ and equity (that is sincerity) in both; so some distinguish them.,20250223
To pay our just debts without fraud_ covin_ or delay,20250223
To persevere in religion. The righteous_ instead of drawing back_ or so much as starting back_ at this frightful spectacle_ or standing still to deliberate whether he should proceed or no (allude to 2 Sam. ii. shall with so much the more constancy and resolution hold on his way and press forward. __Though in me he foresees that bonds and afflictions abide him_ yet none of these things shall move him___ Acts xx.,20250223
To pity those that are wounded in spirit_ and pray earnestly for them_ because in that condition they know not how to pray for themselves. ,20250223
To pity those who are thus censured and condemned. Innocency itself will be no security against a false and foul tongue. Job_ whom God himself praised as the best man in the world_ is here represented by one of his friends_ and he a wise and good man too_ as one of the greatest villains in nature. Let us not think it strange if at any time we be thus blackened_ but learn how to pass by evil report as well as good_ and commit our cause_ as Job did his_ to him that judgeth righteously.,20250223
To pray to God to discover his sins to him (v. 32): __That which I see not teach thou me. Lord_ upon the review_ I find much amiss in me and much done amiss by me_ but I have reason to fear there is much more that I am not aware of_ greater abominations_ which through ignorance_ mistake_ and partiality to myself_ I do not yet see; Lord_ give me to see it_ awaken by conscience to do its office faithfully.__ A good man is willing to know the worst of himself_ and particularly_ under affliction_ desires to be told wherefore God contends with him and what God designs in correcting him,20250223
To prevent the offence that might arise from the present sufferings of good people_ he directs us to look up to God_ ver. 8.,20250223
To promise reformation (v. 31): I will not offend any more. __If I have done iniquity (or seeing that I have)_ I will do so no more; whatever thou shalt discover to me to have been amiss_ by thy grace I will amend it for the future.__ This implies a confession that we have offended_ true remorse and godly sorrow for the offence_ and a humble compliance with God's design in afflicting us_ which is to separate between us and our sins. The penitent here completes his repentance; for it is not enough to be sorry for our sins_ but we must go and sin no more_ and_ as here_ bind ourselves with the bond of a fixed resolution never more to return to folly. This is meet to be said in a stedfast purpose_ and meet to be said to God in a solemn promise and vow.,20250223
To prove the vanity of all things under the sun_ and their insufficiency to make us happy_ Solomon here shows,20250223
To provide for our relations_ and those that have dependence on us_ for to them it is due,20250223
To quicken us to secure spiritual and eternal blessings. If we would be entertained with new things_ we must acquaint ourselves with the things of God_ get a new nature; then old things pass away_ and all things become new_ 2 Cor. v.,20250223
To receive the instruction of wisdom_ justice_ and judgment_ and equity,20250223
To receive them with readiness: __Hear the instruction of thy father; hear it and heed it; hear it and bid it welcome_ and be thankful for it_ and subscribe to it.__ ,20250223
To recommend it to us_ we are told_ not only that it is the instruction of a father_ but that it is understanding_ and therefore should be welcome to intelligent creatures. Religion has reason on its side_ and we are taught it by fair reasoning. It is a law indeed (v. but that law is founded upon doctrine_ upon unquestionable principles of truth_ upon good doctrine_ which is not only faithful_ but worthy of all acceptation. If we admit the doctrine_ we cannot but submit to the law. ,20250223
To recommend to us this expedient for sharpening ourselves_ but with a caution to take heed whom we choose to converse with_ because the influence upon us is so great either for the better or for the worse,20250223
To recommend wisdom to us_ and to quicken us to the diligent use of all the means for the getting of wisdom_ Solomon here shows that fools are fit for nothing; they are either sottish men_ who will never think and design at all_ or vicious men_ who will never think and design well. 1. They are not fit to be entrusted with any business_ not fit to go on an errand (v. 6): He that does but send a message by the hand of a fool_ of a careless heedless person_ one who is so full of his jests and so given to his pleasures that he cannot apply his mind to any thing that is serious_ will find his message misunderstood_ the one half of it forgotten_ the rest awkwardly delivered_ and so many blunders made about it that he might as well have cut off his legs_ that is_ never have sent him. Nay_ he will drink damage; it will be very much to his prejudice to have employed such a one_ who_ instead of bringing him a good account of his affairs_ will abuse him and put a trick upon him; for_ in Solomon's language_ a knave and a fool are of the same signification. It will turn much to a man's disgrace to make use of the service of a fool_ for people will be apt to judge of the master by his messenger,20250223
To recompense his patience and his confidence in God_ which (notwithstanding the workings of corruption) he did not cast away_ but still held fast_ and that is it which has a great recompence of reward_ Heb. x,20250223
To redress the many grievances of human life: __After all_ I find that that which is crooked will be crooked still and cannot be made straight.__ Our knowledge is itself intricate and perplexed; we must go far about and fetch a great compass to come at it. Solomon thought to find out a nearer way to it_ but he could not. The paths of learning are as much a labyrinth as ever they were. The minds and manners of men are crooked and perverse. Solomon thought_ with his wisdom and power together_ thoroughly to reform his kingdom_ and make that straight which he found crooked; but he was disappointed. All the philosophy and politics in the world will not restore the corrupt nature of man to its primitive rectitude; we find the insufficiency of them both in others and in ourselves. Learning will not alter men's natural tempers_ nor cure them of their sinful distempers; nor will it change the constitution of things in this world; a vale of tears it is and so it will be when all is done.,20250223
To refresh himself with her fruits. He compares her breasts (her pious affections towards him) to clusters of grapes_ a most pleasant fruit (v. and he repeats it (v. 8):,20250223
To render dues both to church and state_ magistrates and ministers,20250223
To render evil for evil is brutish_ but to render evil for good is devilish. He is an ill-natured man who_ because he is resolved not to return a kindness_ will revenge it,20250223
To retain them with resolution: __Forsake not their law; think not that when thou art grown up_ and no longer under tutors and governors_ thou mayest live at large; no_ the law of thy mother was according to the law of thy God_ and therefore it must never be forsaken; thou wast trained up in the way in which thou shouldst go_ and therefore_ when thou art old_ thou must not depart from it.__ Some observe that whereas the Gentile ethics_ and the laws of the Persians and Romans_ provided only that children should pay respect to their father_ the divine law secures the honour of the mother also.,20250223
To return no more to our house above ground (v. 10): He shall return no more to his house_ to the possession and enjoyment of it_ to the business and delights of it. Others will take possession_ and keep it till they also resign to another generation. The rich man in hell desired that Lazarus might be sent to his house_ knowing it was to no purpose to ask that he might have leave to go himself. Glorified saints shall return no more to the cares_ and burdens_ and sorrows of their house; nor damned sinners to the gaieties and pleasures of their house. Their place shall no more know them_ no more own them_ have no more acquaintance with them_ nor be any more under their influence. It concerns us to secure a better place when we die_ for this will no more own us.,20250223
To rivet it in us_ we are directed to receive it as a gift_ to attend to it with all diligence_ to attend so as to know it_ for otherwise we cannot do it_ and not to forsake it by disowning the doctrine or disobeying the law.,20250223
To see his children grown up and settled in the world. All his sons were in houses of their own_ probably married_ and to each of them he had given a competent portion to set up with. Those that had been olive-plants round his table were removed to tables of their own,20250223
To see how they and their calamities were slighted by all about them. They wept and needed comfort_ but there was none to do that friendly office: They had no comforter; their oppressors were powerful and threatening_ and therefore they had no comforter; those that should have comforted them durst not_ for fear of displeasing the oppressors and being made their companions for offering to be their comforters. It is sad to see so little humanity among men.,20250223
To see how those that were wronged laid to heart the wrongs that were done them. He beheld the tears of such as were oppressed_ and perhaps could not forbear weeping with them. The world is a place of weepers; look which way we will_ we have a melancholy scene presented to us_ the tears of those that are oppressed with one trouble or other. They find it is to no purpose to complain_ and therefore mourn in secret (as Job_ ch. xvi. 20; xxx. 28); but Blessed are those that mourn,20250223
To see how unable they were to help themselves: On the side of their oppressors there was power_ when they had done wrong_ to stand to it and make good what they had done_ so that the poor were borne down with a strong hand and had no way to obtain redress. It is sad to see power misplaced_ and that which was given men to enable them to do good perverted to support them in doing wrong,20250223
To see might prevailing against right_ to see so much oppression done under the sun_ to see servants_ and labourers_ and poor workmen_ oppressed by their masters_ who take advantage of their necessity to impose what terms they please upon them_ debtors oppressed by cruel creditors and creditors too by fraudulent debtors_ tenants oppressed by hard landlords and orphans by treacherous guardians_ and_ worst of all_ subjects oppressed by arbitrary princes and unjust judges. Such oppressions are done under the sun; above the sun righteousness reigns for ever. Wise men will consider these oppressions_ and contrive to do something for the relief of those that are oppressed. Blessed is he that considers the poor,20250223
To see them in health_ no sickness in their houses_ for that would have spoiled their feasting and turned it into mourning,20250223
To see them thrive in their affairs_ and able to feast one another_ as well as to feed themselves. Good parents desire_ promote_ and rejoice in_ their children's wealth and prosperity as their own,20250223
To show that if men give themselves to such a course of life as this it is just with God to give them up to it_ to abandon them to their own heart's lusts_ that they may walk in their own counsels_ Hos. iv. 7.,20250223
To show that there is a real beauty in holiness_ that all who are sanctified are thereby beautified; they are truly fair,20250223
To show the folly of the children of men in affecting things that are new_ in imagining that they have discovered such things_ and in pleasing and priding themselves in them. We are apt to nauseate old things_ and to grow weary of what we have been long used to_ as Israel of the manna_ and covet_ with the Athenians_ still to tell and hear of some new thing_ and admire this and the other as new_ whereas it is all what has been. Tatianus the Assyrian_ showing the Grecians how all the arts which they valued themselves upon owed their original to those nations which they counted barbarous_ thus reasons with them: __For shame_ do not call those things eureseis—inventions_ which are but mimeseis—imitations.__,20250223
To show their constant and their Godlike mind_,20250223
To speak pertinently: A word upon the wheels_ that runs well_ is well-circumstanced_ in proper time and place—instruction_ advice_ or comfort_ given seasonably_ and in apt expressions_ adapted to the case of the person spoken to and agreeing with the character of the person speaking—is like golden balls resembling apples_ or like true apples of a golden colour (golden rennets)_ or perhaps gilded_ as sometimes we have gilded laurels_ and those embossed in pictures of silver_ or rather brought to table in a silver network basket_ or in a silver box of that which we call filigree—work_ through which the golden apples might be seen. Doubtless in was some ornament of the table_ then well known. As that was very pleasing to the eye_ so is a word fitly spoken to the ear,20250223
To speak to him by prayer_ and expect an answer: Let me speak_ and answer thou me_ v,20250223
To stand in awe of God_ and to fear the power of his wrath. If good men have been put into such consternation by it_ where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? ,20250223
To stoop to our brethren_ and keep up a respect for them. Where there is humility there is a happy presage of honour and preparative for it. Those that humble themselves shall be exalted here and hereafter.,20250223
To strengthen the temptation_ [1.],20250223
To submit to our God_ and keep up a reverence for him: The fear of the Lord_ as it is the beginning of wisdom_ so it is the instruction and correction of wisdom; the principles of religion_ closely adhered to_ will improve our knowledge_ rectify our mistakes_ and be the best and surest guide of our way. An awe of God upon our spirits will put us upon the wisest counsels and chastise us when we say or do unwisely,20250223
To sustain the love-sick soul_ and to keep it from fainting away: __His left hand is under my head_ to bear it up_ nay_ as a pillow to lay it easy.__ David experienced God's hand upholding him then when his soul was following hard after God (Ps. lxiii. and Job in a state of desertion yet found that God put strength into him_ Job xxiii,20250223
To take hold of her as of the boughs of a palm-tree. He compares her stature to a palm-tree (v. so straight_ so strong_ does she appear_ when she is looked upon in her full proportion. The palm-tree is observed to flourish most when it is loaded; so the church_ the more it has been afflicted_ the more it has multiplied; and the branches of it are emblems of victory. Christ says_ __I will go up to the palm-tree_ to entertain myself with the shadow of it (v. 8) and I will take hold of its boughs and observe the beauty of them.__ What Christ has said he will do_ in favour to his people; we may be sure he will do it_ for his kind purposes are never suffered to fall to the ground; and if he take hold of the boughs of his church_ take early hold of her branches_ when they are young and tender_ he will keep his hold and not let them go. ,20250223
To take us off from expecting happiness or satisfaction in the creature. Why should we look for it there_ where never any yet have found it? What reason have we to think that the world should be any kinder to us than it has been to those that have gone before us_ since there is nothing in it that is new_ and our predecessors have made as much of it as could be made? Your fathers did eat manna_ and yet they are dead. See John viii. 8_ 9; vi,20250223
To the consolations of the saints after a state of inward dejection and despondency. A child of God_ under doubts and fears_ is like the earth in winter_ its nights long_ its days dark_ good affections chilled_ nothing done_ nothing got_ the hand sealed up. But comfort will return; the birds shall sing again_ and the flowers appear. Arise therefore_ poor drooping soul_ and come away with thy beloved. Arise_ and shake thyself from the dust_ Isa. lii,20250223
To the conversion of sinners from a state of nature to a state of grace. That blessed change is like the return of the spring_ a universal change and a very comfortable one; it is a new creation; it is being born again. The soul that was hard_ and cold_ and frozen_ and unprofitable_ like the earth in winter_ becomes fruitful_ like the earth in spring_ and by degrees_ like it_ brings its fruits to perfection. This blessed change is owing purely to the approaches and influences of the sun of righteousness_ who calls to us from heaven to arise and come away; come_ gather in summer. ,20250223
To the daughters of Jerusalem_ v. 5_ 6. The church in general_ being in distress_ speaks to particular churches to guard them against the danger they were in of being offended at the church's sufferings_ 1 Thess. iii,20250223
To the delivering of the church from the power of persecuting enemies_ and the restoring of liberty and peace to it_ after a severe winter of suffering and restraint. When the storms of trouble are over and gone_ when the voice of the turtle_ the joyful sound of the gospel of Christ_ is again heard_ and ordinances are enjoyed with freedom_ then arise and come away to improve the happy juncture. Walk in the light of the Lord; sing in the ways of the Lord. When the churches had rest_ then were they edified_ Acts ix,20250223
To the education of children in that which is good there is necessary a due correction of them for what is amiss; every child of ours is a child of Adam_ and therefore has that foolishness bound up in its heart which calls for rebuke_ more or less_ the rod and reproof which give wisdom. Observe_ It is his rod that must be used_ the rod of a parent_ directed by wisdom and love_ and designed for good_ not the rod of a servant,20250223
To the entertainments of the day. __The light of the morning is welcome_ but_ by reason of this inward darkness_ the comfort of it is soon gone_ and the day is to me as dismal as the black and dark night___ Deut. xxviii. 67. See what reason we have to be thankful for the health and ease which enable us to welcome both the shadows of the evening and the light of the morning.,20250223
To the experience of all ages. It was known of old_ since man was placed upon the earth; that is_ ever since man was made he has had this truth written in his heart_ that the sin of sinners will be their ruin; and ever since there were instances of wickedness (which there were soon after man was placed on the earth) there were instances of the punishments of it_ witness the exclusions of Adam and Cain. When sin entered into the world death entered with it: all the world knows that evil pursues sinners_ whom vengeance suffers not to live (Acts xxviii. and subscribes to that (Isa. iii.,20250223
To the hurt of the ruled (many understand it so); whereas they ought to be God's ministers unto their subjects for their good (Rom. xiii. to administer justice_ and to preserve the public peace and order_ they use their power for their hurt_ to invade their property_ encroach upon their liberty_ and patronise the acts of injustice. It is sad with a people when those that should protect their religion and rights aim at the destruction of both. ,20250223
To the hurt of the rulers (so we render it)_ to their own hurt_ to the feeling of their pride and covetousness_ the gratifying of their passion and revenge_ and so to the filling up of the measure of their sins and the hastening and aggravating of their ruin. Agens agendo repatitur—What hurt men do to others will return_ in the end_ to their own hurt.,20250223
To the introducing of the gospel in the room of the Old-Testament dispensation_ during which it had been winter time with the church. Christ's gospel warms that which was cold_ makes that fruitful which before was dead and barren; when it comes to any place it puts a beauty and glory upon that place (2 Cor. iii. 7_ 8) and furnishes occasion for joy. Spring-time is pleasant time_ and so is gospel-time. Aspice venturo lætentur ut omnia seclo—Behold what joy the dawning age inspires! said Virgil_ from the Sibyls_ perhaps with more reference to the setting up of the Messiah's kingdom at that time than he himself thought of. See Ps. xcvi,20250223
To the praise of good children_ that they are the joy of their parents_ who ought to have joy of them_ having taken so much care and pains about them. And it adds much to the satisfaction of those that are good if they have reason to think that they have been a comfort to their parents in their declining years_ when evil days come,20250223
To the praise of man. We must not be greedy of that any more than of pleasure_ because_ for men to search their own glory_ to court applause and covet to make themselves popular_ is not their glory_ but their shame; every one will laugh at them for it; and the glory which is so courted is not glory when it is got_ for it is really no true honour to a man.,20250223
To the repose of the night_ keeping his eyes waking_ so that the night was as wearisome to him as the day_ and the tossings of the night tired him as much as the toils of the day. ,20250223
To the resurrection of the body at the last day_ and the glory to be revealed. The bones that lay in the grave_ as the roots of the plants in the ground during the winter_ shall then flourish as a herb_ Isa. lxvi. 14; xxvi,20250223
To the same purport he paraphrases v. 20_ The womb shall forget him_ &c. __God sets no such mark of his displeasure upon him but that his mother may soon forget him. The hand of justice does not hang him on a gibbet for the birds to feed on; but he is carried to his grave like other men_ to be the sweet food of worms. There he lies quietly_ and neither he nor his wickedness is any more remembered than a tree which is broken to shivers.__ And v. 24_ They are taken out of the way as all others_ that is_ __they are shut up in their graves like all other men; nay_ they die as easily (without those tedious pains which some endure) as an ear of corn is cropped with your hand.__ Compare this with Solomon's observation (Eccl. viii.,20250223
To the shame of wicked children_ that by their wickedness they put contempt upon their parents_ slight their authority_ and make an ill requital for their kindness: A foolish son despises his mother_ that had most sorrow with him and perhaps had too much indulged him_ which makes his sin in despising her the more sinful and her sorrow the more sorrowful.,20250223
To the world she denies the fact_ and is ready to swear it that she is as chaste and modest as any woman_ and never did the wickedness she is suspected of. Those are the works of darkness which are industriously kept from coming to the light. ,20250223
To their spiritual state. Grace is the riches of the soul; it is true riches; but men commonly misrepresent themselves_ either designedly or through mistake and ignorance of themselves. 1. There are many presuming hypocrites_ that are really poor and empty of grace and yet either think themselves rich_ and will not be convinced of their poverty_ or pretend themselves rich_ and will not own their poverty,20250223
To think highly and honourably of God_ ver. 2_ 3_ 5.,20250223
To think meanly of ourselves_ ver. 4_ 6. These_ however misapplied to Job_ are two good lessons for us all to learn.,20250223
To this great kingdom which thou now hast got,20250223
To those that are secure in the way of sin and danger: __Hast thou not slept enough? Is it not far in the day? Does not thy Master call? Are not the Philistines upon thee? When then wilt thou arise?__,20250223
To those that are slothful in the way of work and duty_ in the duties of their particular calling as men or their general calling as Christians. __How long wilt thou waste thy time_ and when wilt thou be a better husband of it? How long wilt thou love thy ease_ and when wilt thou learn to deny thyself_ and to take pains? How long wilt thou bury thy talents_ and when wilt thou begin to trade with them? How long wilt thou delay_ and put off_ and trifle away thy opportunities_ as one regardless of hereafter; and when wilt thou stir up thyself to do what thou hast to do_ which_ if it be not done_ will leave thee for ever undone?__,20250223
To those who understand aright_ who depart from evil (for that is understanding)_ the knowledge of God and of his will is easy. The parables which harden scorners in their scorning_ and make divine things more difficult to them_ enlighten those who are willing to learn_ and make the same things more plain_ and intelligible_ and familiar to them_ Matt. xiii. 11_ 15_ 16. The same word which to the scornful is a savour of death unto death to the humble and serious is a savour of life unto life. He that understands_ so as to depart from evil (for that is understanding)_ to quit his prejudices_ to lay aside all corrupt dispositions and affections_ will easily apprehend instruction and receive the impressions of it.,20250223
To what they saw in him (v. 28): __Be content_ and look upon me; what do you see in me that bespeaks me either a madman or a wicked man? Nay_ look in my face_ and you may discern there the indications of a patient and submissive spirit_ for all this. Let the show of my countenance witness for me that_ though I have cursed my day_ I do not curse my God.__ Or rather_ __Look upon my ulcers and sore boils_ and by them it will be evident to you that I do not lie___ that is_ __that I do not complain without cause. Let your own eyes convince you that my condition is very sad_ and that I do not quarrel with God by making it worse than it is.__ 2. To what they heard from him_ v.,20250223
To whom he spoke: He answered Job_ directed his speech to him_ to convince him of what was amiss_ before he cleared him from the unjust aspersions cast upon him. It is God only that can effectually convince of sin_ and those shall so be humbled whom he designs to exalt. Those that desire to hear from God_ as Job did_ shall certainly hear from him at length,20250223
To whom the invitation is given: Whoso is simple and wants understanding_ v,20250223
Towards God: Also my prayer is pure; but prayer cannot be pure as long as there is injustice in our hands_ Isa. i,20250223
Towards a man's liberty: A man's gift_ if he be in prison_ may procure his enlargement; there are courtiers_ who_ if they use their interest even for oppressed innocency_ expect to receive a gratuity for it. Or_ if a mean man know not how to get access to a great man_ he may do it by a fee to his servants or a present to himself; those will make room for him,20250223
Towards his preferment. It will bring him to sit among great men_ in honour and power. See how corrupt the world is when men's gifts will not do_ though ever so great; nay_ will gain that for them which they are unworthy of and unfit for; and no wonder that those take bribes in their offices who gave bribes for them. Vendere jura potest_ emerat ille prius—He that bought law can sell it.,20250223
Towards men: __Not for any injustice in my hands_ any wealth that I have unjustly got or kept.__ Eliphaz had represented him as a tyrant and an oppressor. __No___ says he_ __I never did any wrong to any man_ but always despised the gain of oppression.__ ,20250223
Triumphing in his approaches towards her_ ver. 8_ 9.,20250223
Trouble and anguish (that inward tribulation and anguish of soul spoken of Rom. ii. 8_ 9_ which are the effect of God's indignation and wrath fastening upon the conscience) shall make him afraid of worse to come. What is the hell before him if this be the hell within him? And though he would fain shake off his fears_ drink them away_ and jest them away_ it will not do; they shall prevail against him_ and overpower him_ as a king ready to the battle_ with forces too strong to be resisted. He that would keep his peace_ let him keep a good conscience. Fourthly_ If at any time he be in trouble_ he despairs of getting out (v. 22): He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness_ but he gives himself up for gone and lost in an endless night. Good men expect light at evening time_ light out of darkness; but what reason have those to expect that they shall return out of the darkness of trouble who would not return from the darkness of sin_ but went on in it? Ps. lxxxii,20250223
Trouble will come upon him_ certainly it will. Troubles in the world often surprise those that are most secure of an uninterrupted prosperity. However_ death will come_ and trouble with it_ when he must leave the world and all his delights in it. The judgment of the great day will come; fearfulness will surprise the hypocrites_ Isa. xxxiii.,20250223
True Friendship.,20250223
True and complete happiness. Serious godliness has a direct tendency to life; to all good_ to eternal life; it is the sure and ready way to it; there is something in the nature of it fitting men for heaven and so leading them to it.,20250223
True believers_ as they are looking for_ so they are hastening to_ the coming of that day of the Lord_ not that they would have him make more haste than good speed_ but that the intermediate counsels may all be fulfilled_ and then that the end may come—the sooner the better. Not that they think him slack concerning his promise_ as some men count slackness_ but thus they express the strength of their affections to him and the vastness of their expectations from him when he comes again,20250223
True dignity will go by merit. If a servant be wise_ and manage things well_ he shall be further trusted_ and not only have rule with_ but rule over a son that causes shame; for God and nature have designed that the fool shall be servant to the wise in heart. Nay_ a prudent servant may perhaps come to have such an interest in his master as to be taken in for a child's share of the estate and to have part of the inheritance among the brethren.,20250223
True merit does not go by dignity. All agree that the son in the family is more worthy than the servant (John viii. and yet sometimes it so happens that the servant is wise_ and a blessing and credit to the family_ when the son is a fool_ and a burden and shame to the family. Eliezer of Damascus_ though Abram could not bear to think that he should be his heir_ was a stay to the family_ when he obtained a wife for Isaac; whereas Ishmael_ a son_ was a shame to it_ when he mocked Isaac,20250223
True religion_ consisting in the fear of the Lord_ which is the wisdom before recommended_ teaches men,20250223
True wisdom consists in the due discharge of our duty towards man_ as well as towards God_ in honesty as well as piety_ and therefore we have here divers excellent precepts of wisdom which relate to our neighbour.,20250223
True wisdom is true honour_ and will gain a man a reputation_ which is like a box of precious ointment_ pleasing and very valuable,20250223
True wisdom_ with its furniture and improvement_ comes from him as the God of grace and the Father of every good and perfect gift. Shall we pretend to be wiser than God_ when we have all our wisdom from him? Nay_ shall we pretend to be wise above our sphere_ and beyond the limits which he that gave us our understanding sets to it? He designed we should with it serve God and do our duty_ but never intended we should with it set up for directors of the stars or the lightning.,20250223
Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. 6 In all thy ways acknowledge him_ and he shall direct thy paths.,20250223
Truth and Falsehood.,20250223
Truth is that by which the heart must be guided and governed_ for without truth there is no goodness; no regular practices without right principles. It is by the power of truth_ known and believed_ that we must be kept back from sin and constrained to duty. The understanding must be well-informed with wisdom and instruction_ and therefore_ ,20250223
Tuque ut te serves non expergisceris?—,20250223
Turn away thine eyes from me_ for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. 6 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing_ whereof every one beareth twins_ and there is not one barren among them. 7 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks. 8 There are threescore queens_ and fourscore concubines_ and virgins without number. 9 My dove_ my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother_ she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her_ and blessed her; yea_ the queens and the concubines_ and they praised her. 10 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning_ fair as the moon_ clear as the sun_ and terrible as an army with banners?,20250223
Turn from afflicting a poor creature thus_ and let him rest awhile; allow him some breathing time_ until he shall accomplish as a hireling his day. It is appointed to me once to die; let that one day suffice me_ and let me not thus be continually dying_ dying a thousand deaths. Let it suffice that my life_ at best_ is as the day of a hireling_ a day of toil and labour. I am content to accomplish that_ and will make the best of the common hardships of human life_ the burden and heat of the day; but let me not feel those uncommon tortures_ let not my life be as the day of a malefactor_ all execution-day.__ Thus may we find some relief under great troubles by recommending ourselves to the compassion of that God who knows our frame and will consider it_ and our being out of frame too.,20250223
Turn from him_ that he may rest_ till he shall accomplish_ as a hireling_ his day.,20250223
Turn thy eyes towards me (so some read it)_ __turn the eyes of faith and love towards me_ for they have lifted me up; look unto me_ and be comforted.__ When we are calling to God to turn the eye of his favour towards us he is calling to us to turn the eye of our obedience towards him. We read it as a strange expression of love_ __Turn away thy eyes from me_ for I cannot bear the brightness of them; they have quite overcome me_ and I am prevailed with to overlook all that is past;__ as God said to Moses_ when he interceded for Israel_ __Let me alone_ or I must yield___ Exod. xxxii,20250223
Twenty chapters of the book of Proverbs (beginning with ch. x. and ending with ch. xxix.)_ consisting mostly of entire sentences in each verse_ could not well be reduced to proper heads_ and the contents of them gathered; I have therefore here put the contents of all these chapters together_ which perhaps may be of some use to those who desire to see at once all that is said of any one head in these chapters. Some of the verses_ perhaps_ I have not put under the same heads that another would have put them under_ but the most of them fall (I hope) naturally enough to the places I have assigned them.,20250223
Two extremes in the management of family-affairs are here condemned and the ill consequences of them foretold:—1. Carefulness and carnal policy_ on the one hand. There are those that by their extreme earnestness in pursuit of the world_ their anxiety about their business and fretfulness about their losses_ their strictness with their servants and their niggardliness towards their families_ trouble their own houses and give continual vexation to all about them; while others think_ by supporting factions and feuds in their families_ which are really a trouble to their houses_ to serve some turn for themselves_ and either to get or to save by it. But they will both be disappointed; they will inherit the wind. All they will get by these arts will not only be empty and worthless as the wind_ but noisy and troublesome_ vanity and vexation,20250223
Two more instances we have here of Job's integrity:—,20250223
Two reasons he gives why we should be thus cautious in going to law:—1. __Because otherwise the cause will be in danger of going against thee_ and thou wilt not know what to do when the defendant has justified himself in what thou didst charge upon him_ and made it out that thy complaint was frivolous and vexatious and that thou hadst no just cause of action_ and so put thee to shame_ non-suit thee_ and force thee to pay costs_ all which might have been prevented by a little consideration.__ 2. __Because it will turn very much to thy reproach if thou fall under the character of being litigious. Not only the defendant himself (v. but he that hears the cause tried will put thee to shame_ will expose thee as a man of no principle_ and thy infamy will not turn away; thou wilt never retrieve thy reputation.__,20250223
Two sorts of people are dangerous to be conversed with:—1. Tale-bearers_ though they are commonly flatterers_ and by fair speeches insinuate themselves into men's acquaintance. Those are unprincipled people that go about carrying stories_ that make mischief among neighbours and relations_ that sow in the minds of people jealousies of their governors_ of their ministers_ and of one another_ that reveal secrets which they are entrusted with or which by unfair means they come to the knowledge of_ under pretence of guessing at men's thoughts and intentions_ tell that of them which is really false. __Be not familiar with such; do not give them the hearing when they tell their tales and reveal secrets_ for you may be sure that they will betray your secrets too and tell tales of you.__ 2. Flatterers_ for they are commonly tale-bearers. If a man fawn upon you_ compliment and commend you_ suspect him to have some design upon you_ and stand upon your guard; he would pick that out of you which will serve him to make a story of to somebody else to your prejudice; therefore meddle not with him that flatters with his lips. Those too dearly love_ and too dearly buy_ their own praise_ that will put confidence in a man and trust him with a secret or business because he flatters them.,20250223
Two sorts of persons are here spoken of that are ruining their own estates_ and will be beggars shortly_ and therefore are not to be trusted with any good security:—1. Those that will be bound for any body that will ask them_ that entangle themselves in rash suretiship to oblige their idle companions; they will break at last_ nay_ they cannot hold out long; these waste by wholesale,20250223
Two things are here declared to be of bad consequence:—1. Ignorance: To be without the knowledge of the soul is not good_ so some read it. Know we not our own selves_ our own hearts? A soul without knowledge is not good; it is a great privilege that we have souls_ but_ if these souls have not knowledge_ what the better are we? If man has not understanding_ he is as the beasts_ Ps. xlix An ignorant soul cannot be a good soul. That the soul be without knowledge is not safe_ nor pleasant; what good can the soul do_ of what is it good for_ if it be without knowledge? 2. Rashness. He that hastes with his feet (that does things inconsiderately and with precipitation_ and will not take time to ponder the path of his feet) sins; he cannot but often miss the mark and take many a false step_ which those prevent that consider their ways. As good not know as not consider.,20250223
Two things are here intimated to be the causes of the mal-administration of princes:—1. The love of money_ that root of all evil; for hating covetousness here stands opposed to oppression_ according to Moses's character of good magistrates_ men fearing God and hating covetousness (Exod. xviii. not only not being covetous_ but hating it_ and shaking the hands from the holding of bribes. A ruler that is covetous will neither do justly nor love mercy_ but the people under him shall be bought and sold,20250223
Two things are here pronounced pleasant:— 1. It is pleasant to have a good prospect to see the light of the sun (Eccl. xi. 7) and by it to see the wonderful works of God_ with which this lower world is beautified and enriched. Those that want the mercy know how to value it; how would the light of the eyes rejoice their hearts! The consideration of this should make us thankful for our eyesight,20250223
Two things are here recommended to us_ in dealing with others_ as likely means to gain our point:—1. Patience_ to bear a present heat without being put into a heat by it_ and to wait for a fit opportunity to offer our reasons and to give persons time to consider them. By this means even a prince may be persuaded to do a thing which he seemed very averse to_ much more a common person. That which is justice and reason now will be so another time_ and therefore we need not urge them with violence now_ but wait for a more convenient season,20250223
Two things are here represented as very absurd: 1. That men of no repute should be dictators. What can be more unbecoming than for fools_ who are known to have little sense and discretion_ to pretend to that which is above them and which they were never cut out for? A fool_ in Solomon's proverbs_ signifies a wicked man_ whom excellent speech does not become_ because his conversation gives the lie to his excellent speech. What have those to do to declare God's statutes who hate instruction? Ps. l,20250223
Two things are here said to be insatiable_ and they are two things near of kin—death and sin.,20250223
Two things are here spoken of with astonishment:—1. God's great goodness to foolish man_ in putting a price into his hand to get wisdom_ to get knowledge and grace to fit him for both worlds. We have rational souls_ the means of grace_ the strivings of the Spirit_ access to God by prayer; we have time and opportunity. He that has a good estate (so some understand it) has advantages thereby of getting wisdom by purchasing instruction. Good parents_ relations_ ministers_ friends_ are helps to get wisdom. It is a price_ therefore of value_ a talent. It is a price in the hand_ in possession; the word is nigh thee. It is a price for getting; it is for our own advantage; it is for getting wisdom_ the very thing which_ being fools_ we have most need of. We have reason to wonder that God should so consider our necessity_ and should entrust us with such advantages_ though he foresaw we should not make a right improvement of them,20250223
Two things we are apt to take a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction in_ and value ourselves upon_ with reference to our business and enjoyments in the world_ as if they helped to save them from vanity. Solomon shows us our mistake in both.,20250223
Two things_ by which God is greatly affronted_ men are here said to be ensnared by_ and entangled not only in guilt_ but in trouble and ruin at length:—1. Sacrilege_ men's alienating holy things and converting them to their own use_ which is here called devouring them. What is devoted in any way to the service and honour of God_ for the support of religion and divine worship or the relief of the poor_ ought to be conscientiously preserved to the purposes designed; and those that directly or indirectly embezzle it_ or defeat the purpose for which it was given_ will have a great deal to answer for. Will a man rob God in tithes and offerings? Mal. iii,20250223
Two ways Bildad takes here to exalt God and abase man:—,20250223
Two ways a man may show himself to be a wise man:—1. By the good temper_ the sweetness and the sedateness_ of his mind: A man of understanding is of an excellent spirit_ a precious spirit (so the word is); he is one that looks well to his spirit_ that it be as it should be_ and so keeps it in an even frame_ easy to himself and pleasant to others. A gracious spirit is a precious spirit_ and renders a man amiable and more excellent than his neighbour. He is of a cool spirit (so some read it)_ not heated with passion_ nor put into any tumult or disorder by the impetus of any corrupt affection_ but even and stayed. A cool head with a warm heart is an admirable composition,20250223
Ultimate Ruin of the Wicked. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Unbridled passion is folly proclaimed: He that is hasty of spirit_ whose heart is tinder to every spark of provocation_ that is all fire and tow_ as we say_ he thinks hereby to magnify himself and make those about stand in awe of him_ whereas really he exalts his own folly; he makes it known_ as that which is lifted up is visible to all_ and he submits himself to it as to the government of one that is exalted.,20250223
Unbridled passions embitter and spoil the comfort of all relations. A peevish angry wife makes her husband's life uneasy_ to whom she should be a comfort and a meet help. Those cannot dwell in peace and happiness that cannot dwell in peace and love. Even those that are one flesh_ if they be not withal one spirit_ have no joy of their union,20250223
Under some tyrants_ it has been crime enough to be rich; and how little is a man beholden to his wealth when it only serves to redeem that life which otherwise would not have been exposed! 2. Those that are poor_ if by some_ that should be their friends_ they are despised and overlooked_ yet_ to balance that_ they are also despised and overlooked by others that would be their enemies if they had any thing to lose: The poor hear not rebuke_ are not censured_ reproached_ accused_ nor brought into trouble_ as the rich are; for nobody thinks it worth while to take notice of them. When the rich Jews were carried captives to Babylon the poor of the land were left_ 2 Kings xxv,20250223
Under those mountains were they_,20250223
Underneath are the everlasting arms,20250223
Ungoverned passion often grows more violent when it meets with some rebuke and check. The troubled sea rages most when it dashes against a rock. Job had been courting death_ as that which would be the happy period of his miseries_ ch. iii. For this Eliphaz had gravely reproved him_ but he_ instead of unsaying what he had said_ says it here again with more vehemence than before; and it is as ill said as almost any thing we meet with in all his discourses_ and is recorded for our admonition_ not our imitation.,20250223
United strength. If an enemy find a man alone_ he is likely to prevail against him; with his own single strength he cannot make his part good_ but_ if he have a second_ he may do well enough: two shall withstand him. __You shall help me against my enemy_ and I will help you against yours;__ according to the agreement between Joab and Abishai (2 Sam. x. and so both are conquerors; whereas_ acting separately_ both would have been conquered; as was said of the ancient Britons_ when the Romans invaded them_ Dum singuli pugnant_ universi vincuntur—While they fight in detached parties_ they sacrifice the general cause. In our spiritual warfare we may be helpful to one another as well as in our spiritual work; next to the comfort of communion with God_ is that of the communion of saints. He concludes with this proverb_ A threefold cord is not easily broken_ any more than a bundle of arrows_ though each single thread_ and each single arrow_ is. Two together he compares to a threefold cord; for where two are closely joined in holy love and fellowship_ Christ will by his Spirit come to them_ and make the third_ as he joined himself to the two disciples going to Emmaus_ and then there is a threefold cord that can never be broken. They that dwell in love_ dwell in God_ and God in them.,20250223
Unmercifulness to the poor_ the widows_ and the fatherless_ ver. 16-23,20250223
Unprofitable talk is evil talk. We must give an account in the great day not only for wicked words_ but for idle words. Speeches therefore which do no good_ which do no service either to God or our neighbour_ or no justice to ourselves_ which are no way to the use of edifying_ were better unspoken. Those words which are as wind_ light and empty_ especially which are as the east wind_ hurtful and pernicious_ it will be pernicious to fill either ourselves or others with_ for they will pass very ill in the account,20250223
Unsearchable_ and such as can never be fathomed_ can never be found out from the beginning to the end_ Eccl. iii,20250223
Until the set time comes for my being remembered_ as Noah was remembered in the ark (Gen. viii. 1)_ where God not only hid him from the destruction of the old world_ but reserved him for the reparation of a new world. The bodies of the saints shall not be forgotten in the grave. There is a time appointed_ a time set_ for their being enquired after. We cannot be sure that we shall look through the darkness of our present troubles and see good days after them in this world; but_ if we can but get well to the grave_ we may with an eye of faith look through the darkness of that_ as Job here_ and see better days on the other side of it_ in a better world.,20250223
Until thy wrath be past. As long as the bodies of the saints lie in the grave_ so long there are some remains of that wrath which they were by nature children of_ so long they are under some of the effects of sin; but_ when the body is raised_ it is wholly past—death_ the last enemy_ will then be totally destroyed. ,20250223
Unto you_ O men! I call_ Prov. viii,20250223
Usually young men are the disputants and old men the moderators; but here_ when old men were the disputants_ as a rebuke to them for their unbecoming heat_ a young man is raised up to be the moderator. Divers of Job's friends were present_ that came to visit him and to receive instruction. Now here we have_,20250223
Ut jugulent homines_ surgunt de nocte latrones_,20250223

V. A permission granted to Satan to make this trial_ v,20250223
V. As the manner of the composition of these books is excellent_ and very proper to engage the attention_ move the affections_ and fix them in the memory_ so the matter is highly useful_ and such as will be every way serviceable to us. They have in them the very sum and substance of religion_ and what they contain is more fitted to our hand_ and made ready for use_ than any part of the Old Testament_ upon which account_ if we may be allowed to compare one star with another in the firmament of the scripture_ these will be reckoned stars of the first magnitude. All scripture is profitable (and this part of it in a special manner) for instruction in doctrine_ in devotion_ and in the right ordering of the conversation. The book of Job directs us what we are to believe concerning,20250223
V. For the further clearing of this great difficulty_ as he began this discourse with the doctrine of the happiness of the righteous (whatever they may suffer_ they and their works are in the hands of God_ and therefore in good hands_ they could not be in better)_ so he concludes with the doctrine of the misery of the wicked; however they may prosper_ madness is in their heart while they live_ and after that they go to the dead. Envy not the prosperity of evil-doers_ for,20250223
V. God provides food for the inferior creatures_ and it is by his providence_ not by any care or pains of ours_ that they are fed. The following chapter is wholly taken up with the instances of God's power and goodness about animals_ and therefore some transfer to it the last three verses of this chapter_ which speak of the provision made,20250223
V. He brings ruin upon hypocrites_ the secret enemies of his kingdom (such as Elihu described_ v. who_ though they were numbered among the righteous whom Elihu had spoken of before_ yet did not obey God_ but_ being children of disobedience and darkness_ become children of wrath and perdition; these are the hypocrites in heart_ who heap up wrath_ v,20250223
V. He charges him with opposition to God himself and to religion (v. 12_ 13): __Why doth thy heart carry thee away into such indecent irreligious expressions?__ Note_ Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust_ Jam. i,20250223
V. He endeavours to convince them of the wrong they did to God's honour_ while they pretended to plead for him_ v. 7_ 8. They valued themselves upon it that they spoke for God_ were advocates for him_ and had undertaken to justify him and his proceedings against Job; and_ being (as they thought) of counsel for the sovereign_ they expected not only the ear of the court and the last word_ but judgment on their side. But Job tells them plainly,20250223
V. He finds himself wasting away apace under the heavy hand of God_ v,20250223
V. He grounds his comfort upon the testimony of his conscience for him that he had been faithful and firm to his profession of religion_ and in some degree useful and serviceable to the glory of God in his generation: I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. Observe,20250223
V. He shows how much she was esteemed_ not by him only_ but by all that had acquaintance with her and stood in relation to her. It would add to her praise to say,20250223
V. He wishes to argue the case even with God himself_ if he might but have leave to settle the preliminaries of the treaty_ v. 20-22. He had desired (v. 3) to reason with God_ and is still of the same mind. He will not hide himself_ that is_ he will not decline the trial_ nor dread the issue of it_ but under two provisos:—1. That his body might not be tortured with this exquisite pain: __Withdraw thy hand far from me; for_ while I am in this extremity_ I am fit for nothing. I can make a shift to talk with my friends_ but I know not how to address myself to thee.__ When we are to converse with God we have need to be composed_ and as free as possible from every thing that may make us uneasy,20250223
V. Her compliance with these methods of divine grace at last: My bowels were moved for him. The will was gained by a good work wrought upon the affections: My bowels were moved for him_ as those of the two disciples were when Christ made their hearts to burn within them. She was moved with compassion to her beloved_ because his head was wet with dew. Note_ Tenderness of spirit_ and a heart of flesh_ prepare the soul for the reception of Christ into it; and therefore his love to us is represented in such a way as is most affecting. Did Christ redeem us in his pity? Let us in pity receive him_ and_ for his sake_ those that are his_ when at any time they are in distress. This good work_ wrought upon her affections_ raised her up_ and made her ashamed of her dulness and slothfulness (v. 5_ I rose up_ to open to my beloved)_ his grace inclining her to do it and conquering the opposition of unbelief. It was her own act_ and yet he wrought it in her. And now her hands dropped with myrrh upon the handles of the lock. Either,20250223
V. His life was long. What age he was when his troubles came we are nowhere told_ but here we are told he lived 140 years_ whence some conjecture that he was 70 when he was in his troubles_ and that so his age was doubled_ as his other possessions. 1. He lived to have much of the comfort of this life_ for he saw his posterity to the fourth generation_ v,20250223
V. How close she kept to him when she had found him. She is now as much in fear of losing him as before she was in care to find him: I held him_ held him fast_ as the women_ when they met with Christ after his resurrection_ held him by the feet_ and worshipped him_ Matt. xxviii,20250223
V. It is a ruin_ not only to himself_ but to his family: It shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle_ for the curse shall reach him_ and he shall be cut off perhaps by the same grievous disease. There is an entail of wrath upon the family_ which will destroy both his heirs and his inheritance_ v,20250223
V. Of the place and way of light and darkness. Of the day-spring he had spoken before (v. 12) and he returns to speak of it again (v. 19): Where is the way where light dwells? And again (v. 24): By what way is the light parted? He challenges him to describe,20250223
V. Of the sinfulness of human life_ arising from the sinfulness of the human nature. So some understand that question (v.,20250223
V. See a universal amazement at his fall_ v,20250223
V. She experiences the power and tenderness of divine grace_ relieving her in her present faintings_ v,20250223
V. That God_ instead of delivering him out of their hands_ as he hoped_ delivered him into their hands (v. 11): He hath turned me over into the hands of the wicked. They could have had no power against him if it had not been given them from above. He therefore looks beyond them to God who gave them their commission_ as David did when Shimei cursed him; but he thinks it strange_ and almost thinks it hard_ that those should have power against him who were God's enemies as much as his. God sometimes makes use of wicked men as his sword to one another (Ps. xvii. 13) and his rod to his own children_ Isa. x,20250223
V. That it is much better for us to have our corruptions mortified by the rebuke of the wise than to have them gratified by the song of fools_ v,20250223
V. The devil's base insinuation against Job_ in answer to God's encomium of him. He could not deny but that Job feared God_ but suggested that he was a mercenary in his religion_ and therefore a hypocrite (v. 9): Doth Job fear God for nought? Observe,20250223
V. The enjoyment of what we have cannot but be acknowledged more rational than a greedy grasping at more (v. 9): Better is the sight of the eyes_ making the best of that which is present_ than the wandering of the desire_ the uneasy walking of the soul after things at a distance_ and the affecting of a variety of imaginary satisfactions. He is much happier that is always content_ though he has ever so little_ than he that is always coveting_ though he has ever so much. We cannot say_ Better is the sight of the eyes than the fixing of the desire upon God_ and the resting of the soul in him; it is better to live by faith in things to come than to live by sense_ which dwells only upon present things; but better is the sight of the eyes than the roving of the desire after the world_ and the things of it_ than which nothing is more uncertain nor more unsatisfying at the best. This wandering of the desire is vanity and vexation of spirit. It is vanity at the best; if what is desired_ be obtained_ it proves not what we promised ourselves from it_ but commonly the wandering desire is crossed and disappointed_ and then it turns to vexation of spirit.,20250223
V. The general rule which God will go by in dealing with the children of men inferred from this instance_ v. 27_ 28. As sick people_ upon their submission_ are restored_ so all others that truly repent of their sins shall find mercy with God. See here,20250223
V. The gracious concern he had for mankind_ v,20250223
V. We must act considerately in all we do (v. 26): Ponder the path of thy feet_ weigh it (so the word is); __put the word of God in one scale_ and what thou hast done_ or art about to do_ in the other_ and see how they agree; be nice and critical in examining whether thy way be good before the Lord and whether it will end well.__ We must consider our past ways and examine what we have done_ and our present ways_ what we are doing_ whither we are going_ and see that we walk circumspectly. It concerns us to consider what are the duties and what the difficulties_ what are the advantages and what the dangers_ of our way_ that we may act accordingly. __Do nothing rashly.__,20250223
V. We must study to answer God's end in all his providences_ which is in general to make us religious. God does all that men should fear before him_ to convince them that there is a God above them that has a sovereign dominion over them_ at whose disposal they are and all their ways_ and in whose hands their times are and all events concerning them_ and that therefore they ought to have their eyes ever towards him_ to worship and adore him_ to acknowledge him in all their ways_ to be careful in every thing to please him_ and afraid of offending him in any thing. God thus changes his disposals_ and yet is unchangeable in his counsels_ not to perplex us_ much less to drive us to despair_ but to teach us our duty to him and engage us to do it. That which God designs in the government of the world is the support and advancement of religion among men.,20250223
V. With a proud and arrogant expectation to give law even to Providence itself: __Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Surely not; there is no reason for that_ that the course of nature should be changed and the settled rules of government violated to gratify the humour of one man. Job_ dost thou think the world cannot stand without thee; but that_ if thou art ruined_ all the world is ruined and forsaken with thee?__ Some make it a reproof of Job's justification of himself_ falsely insinuating that either Job was a wicked man or we must deny a Providence and suppose that God has forsaken the earth and the rock of ages is removed. It is rather a just reproof of his passionate complaints. When we quarrel with the events of Providence we forget that_ whatever befals us_ it is,20250223
VI,20250223
VI. Finding her beloved thus nigh unto her she is in great care that her communion with him be not interrupted (v. 7): I charge you_ O you daughters of Jerusalem. Jerusalem_ the mother of us all_ charges all her daughters_ the church charges all her members_ the believing soul charges all its powers and faculties_ the spouse charges herself and all about her_ not to stir up_ or awake_ her love until he please_ now that he is asleep in her arms_ as she was borne up in his_ v,20250223
VI. He charges him with justifying himself to such a degree as even to deny his share in the common corruption and pollution of the human nature (v. 14): What is man_ that he should be clean? that is_ that he should pretend to be so_ or that any should expect to find him so. What is he that is born of a woman_ a sinful woman_ that he should be righteous? Note,20250223
VI. He endeavours to possess them with a fear of God's judgment_ and so to bring them to a better temper. Let them not think to impose upon God as they might upon a man like themselves_ nor expect to gain his countenance in their bad practices by pretending a zeal for him and his honour. __As one man mocks another by flattering him_ do you think so to mock him and deceive him?__ Assuredly those who think to put a cheat upon God will prove to have put a cheat upon themselves. Be not deceived_ God is not mocked. That they might not think thus to jest with God_ and affront him_ Job would have them to consider both God and themselves_ and then they would find themselves unable to enter into judgment with him.,20250223
VI. He justifies himself_ in this extreme desire of death_ from the deplorable condition he was now in_ v. 11_ 12. Eliphaz_ in the close of his discourse_ had put him in hopes that he should yet see a good issue of his troubles; but poor Job puts these cordials away from him_ refuses to be comforted_ abandons himself to despair_ and very ingeniously_ yet perversely_ argues against the encouragements that were given him. Disconsolate spirits will reason strangely against themselves. In answer to the pleasing prospects Eliphaz had flattered him with_ he here intimates,20250223
VI. He produces the encomium that was given of her_ and makes it his own (v. 10): Who is she that looks forth as the morning? This is applicable both to the church in the world and to grace in the heart.,20250223
VI. Her said disappointment when she did open to her beloved. And here is the most melancholy part of the story: I opened to my beloved_ as I intended_ but_ alas! my beloved had withdrawn himself_ and was gone. My beloved was gone_ was gone_ so the word is.,20250223
VI. How desirous she was to make others acquainted with him: __I brought him to my mother's house_ that all my relations_ all who are dear to me_ might have the benefit of communion with him.__ When Zaccheus found Christ_ or rather was found of him_ salvation came to his house_ Luke,20250223
VI. It is a ruin which will manifestly appear to be just and righteous_ and what he has brought upon himself by his own wickedness; for (v. 27) the heaven shall reveal his iniquity_ that is_ the God of heaven_ who sees all the secret wickedness of the wicked_ will_ by some means or other_ let all the world know what a base man he has been_ that they may own the justice of God in all that is brought upon him. The earth also shall rise up against him_ both to discover his wickedness and to avenge it. The earth shall disclose her blood_ Isa. xxvi,20250223
VI. Of the settled period of human life_ v. 5.,20250223
VI. Of the treasures of the snow and hail (v. 22_ 23): __Hast thou entered into these and taken a view of them?__ In the clouds the snow and hail are generated_ and thence they come in such abundance that one would think there were treasures of them laid up in store there_ whereas indeed they are produced extempore—suddenly_ as I may say_ and pro re nata—for the occasion. Sometimes they come so opportunely_ to serve the purposes of Providence_ in God's fighting for his people and against his and their enemies_ that one would think they were laid up as magazines_ or stores of arms_ ammunition_ and provisions_ against the time of trouble_ the day of battle and war_ when God will either contend with the world in general (as in the deluge_ when the windows of heaven were opened_ and the waters fetched out of these treasures to drown a wicked world_ that waged war with Heaven) or with some particular persons or parties_ as when God out of these treasures fetched great hail-stones wherewith to fight against the Canaanites_ Josh. x,20250223
VI. Our lot_ whatever it is_ is that which is appointed us by the counsel of God_ which cannot be altered_ and it is therefore our wisdom to reconcile ourselves to it and cheerfully to acquiesce in it (v. 10): That which has been_ or (as some read it) that which is_ and so likewise that which shall be_ is named already; it is already determined in the divine foreknowledge_ and all our care and pains cannot make it otherwise than as it is fixed. Jacta est alea—The die is cast. It is therefore folly to quarrel with that which will be as it is_ and wisdom to make a virtue of necessity. We shall have what pleases God_ and let that please us.,20250223
VI. See all this averred as the unanimous sense of the patriarchal age_ grounded upon their knowledge of God and their many observations of his providence (v. 21): Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked_ and this is the place (this the condition) of him that knows not God! See here what is the beginning_ and what is the end_ of the wickedness of this wicked world. 1. The beginning of it is ignorance of God_ and it is a wilful ignorance_ for there is that to be known of him which is sufficient to leave them for ever inexcusable. They know not God_ and then they commit all iniquity. Pharaoh knows not the Lord_ and therefore will not obey his voice,20250223
VI. That God not only delivered him into the hands of the wicked_ but took him into his own hands too_ into which it is a fearful thing to fall (v. 12): __I was at ease in the comfortable enjoyment of the gifts of God's bounty_ not fretting and uneasy_ as some are in the midst of their prosperity_ who thereby provoke God to strip them; yet he has broken me asunder_ put me upon the rack of pain_ and torn me limb from limb.__ God_ in afflicting him_ had seemed,20250223
VI. The complaint Satan made of Job's prosperity_ v,20250223
VI. We must act with steadiness_ caution_ and consistency: __Let all thy ways be established (v.,20250223
VI. Whatever changes we see or feel in this world_ we must acknowledge the inviolable steadiness of God's government. The sun rises and sets_ the moon increases and decreases_ and yet both are where they were_ and their revolutions are in the same method from the beginning according to the ordinances of heaven; so it is with the events of Providence (v. 15): That which has been is now. God has not of late begun to use this method. No; things were always as mutable and uncertain as they are now_ and so they will be: That which is to be has already been; and therefore we speak inconsiderately when we say_ __Surely the world was never so bad as it is now___ or __None ever met with such disappointments as we meet with___ or __The times will never mend;__ they may mend with us_ and after a time to mourn there may come a time to rejoice_ but that will still be liable to the common character_ to the common fate. The world_ as it has been_ is and will be constant in inconstancy; for God requires that which is past_ that is_ repeats what he has formerly done and deals with us no otherwise than as he has used to deal with good men; and shall the earth be forsaken for us_ or the rock removed out of his place? There has no change befallen us_ nor any temptation by it overtaken us_ but such as is common to men. Let us not be proud and secure in prosperity_ for God may recall a past trouble_ and order that to seize us and spoil our mirth (Ps. xxx. 7); nor let us despond in adversity_ for God may call back the comforts that are past_ as he did to Job. We may apply this to our past actions_ and our behaviour under the changes that have affected us. God will call us to account for that which is past; and therefore_ when we enter into a new condition_ we should judge ourselves for our sins in our former condition_ prosperous or afflicted.,20250223
Vain knowledge or unprofitable talk ought to be reproved and checked_ especially in a wise man_ whom it worst becomes and who does most hurt by the bad example of it.,20250223
Valleys were sunk for it in the earth_ capacious enough to receive it_ and there it is laid to sleep; and_ if it be sometimes tossed with winds_ that (as bishop Patrick observes) is but the rocking of the cradle_ which makes it sleep the faster. As for the sea_ so for every one of us_ there is a decreed place; for he that determined the times before appointed determined also the bounds of our habitation,20250223
Vanity of Human Wisdom.,20250223
Vanity of Worldly Pleasure.,20250223
Vanity of vanities_ all is vanity; that is the doctrine too; it is proved at large by many arguments and an induction of particulars_ and divers objections are answered_ and in the close we have the use and application of all_ by way of exhortation_ to remember our Creator_ to fear him_ and to keep his commandments. There are indeed many things in this book which are dark and hard to be understood_ and some things which men of corrupt minds wrest to their own destruction_ for want of distinguishing between Solomon's arguments and the objections of atheists and epicures; but there is enough easy and plain to convince us (if we will admit the conviction) of the vanity of the world_ and its utter insufficiency to make us happy_ the vileness of sin_ and its certain tendency to make us miserable_ and of the wisdom of being religious_ and the solid comfort and satisfaction that are to be had in doing our duty both to God and man. This should be intended in every sermon_ and that is a good sermon by which these points are in any measure gained.,20250223
Verily I have cleansed my hands in vain_ Ps. lxxiii. 13_ 14. Who will be honest if the tabernacles of robbers prosper? ch. xii,20250223
Verily_ thou shalt be fed_ nay_ even in the days of famine thou shalt be satisfied_ Ps.,20250223
Very artfully and with design. He has the subtlety of the serpent_ and carries on his projects with a great deal of craft and management (v. with his eyes_ with his feet_ with his fingers. He expresses his malice when he dares not speak out (so some)_ or_ rather_ thus he carries on his plot; those about him_ whom he makes use of as the tools of his wickedness_ understand the ill meaning of a wink of his eye_ a stamp of his feet_ the least motion of his fingers. He gives orders for evil-doing_ and yet would not be thought to do so_ but has ways of concealing what he does_ so that he may not be suspected. He is a close man_ and upon the reserve; those only shall be let into the secret that would do any thing he would have them to do. He is a cunning man_ and upon the trick; he has a language by himself_ which an honest man is not acquainted with_ nor desires to be. ,20250223
Very good and seasonable advice to him_ which Eliphaz transfers to himself in a figure: __For my part_ the best way I should think I could take_ if I were in thy condition_ would be to apply to God.__ Note_ We should give our friends no other counsel than what we would take ourselves if we were in their case_ that we may be easy under our afflictions_ may get good by them_ and may see a good issue of them. ,20250223
Very ignorant: She is simple and knows nothing_ that is_ she has no sufficient solid reason to offer; where she gets dominion in a soul she works out all the knowledge of holy things; they are lost and forgotten. Whoredom_ and wine_ and new wine_ take away the heart; they besot men_ and make fools of them.,20250223
Very importunate. The less she has to offer that is rational the more violent and pressing she is_ and carries the day often by dint of impudence. She is clamorous and noisy (v. continually haunting young people with her enticements. She sits at the door of her house (v. watching for a prey; not as Abraham at his tent-door_ seeking an opportunity to do good. She sits on a seat (on a throne_ so the word signifies) in the high places of the city_ as if she had authority to give law_ and we were all debtors to the flesh_ to live after the flesh_ and as if she had reputation_ and were in honour_ and thought worthy of the high places of the city; and perhaps she gains upon many more by pretending to be fashionable than by pretending to be agreeable. __Do not all persons of rank and figure in the world__ (says she) __give themselves a greater liberty than the strict laws of virtue allow; and why shouldst thou humble thyself so far as to be cramped by them?__ Thus the tempter affects to seem both kind and great.,20250223
Very palatable and grateful to the taste. It goes down sweetly; it goes straightly (so the margin reads it); it moves itself aright_ Prov. xxiii,20250223
Very pathetically; she cries_ and again she cries_ as one in earnest. Jesus stood and cried. She utters her voice_ she utters her words with all possible clearness and affection. God is desirous to be heard and heeded.,20250223
Very spitefully and with ill design. It is not so much ambition or covetousness that is in his heart_ as downright frowardness_ malice_ and ill nature. He aims not so much to enrich and advance himself as to do an ill turn to those about him. He is continually devising one mischief or other_ purely for mischief-sake—a man of Belial indeed_ of the devil_ resembling him not only in subtlety_ but in malice.,20250223
Vice_ reigning in a nation_ puts disgrace upon it: Sin is a reproach to any city or kingdom_ and renders them despicable among their neighbours. The people of Israel were often instances of both parts of this observation; they were great when they were good_ but when they forsook God all about them insulted them and trampled on them. It is therefore the interest and duty of princes to use their power for the suppression of vice and support of virtue.,20250223
Vigour and diligence in the prosecution of sin—feet that are swift in running to mischief_ as if they were afraid of losing time or were impatient of delay in a thing they are so greedy of. The policy and vigilance_ the eagerness and industry_ of sinners_ in their sinful pursuits_ may shame us who go about that which is good so awkwardly and so coldly,20250223
Violence done will recoil in the face of him that does it: The soul of the transgressors that harbours and plots mischief_ and vents it by word and deed_ shall eat violence; they shall have their belly full of it. Reward her as she has rewarded thee_ Rev. xviii,20250223
Virgil.,20250223
Virtue will have its praise_ Phil. iv,20250223
Visiting the afflicted_ sick or sore_ fatherless or childless_ in their sorrow_ is made a branch of pure religion and undefiled (Jam. i. and_ if done from a good principle_ will be abundantly recompensed shortly_ Matt. xxv. 36.,20250223
Walk in the way of good men (Prov. ii. follow the track_ ask for the good old way_ observe the footsteps of the flock_ and go forth by them. It will not serve to sit still and cry_ __Lord_ show me the way___ but we must bestir ourselves to enquire out the way; and we may find it by looking which way the footsteps of the flock lead_ what has been the practice of godly people all along; let that practice be ours_ Heb. vi. 12,20250223
Want of consideration: He that hates covetousness shall prolong his government and peace_ shall be happy in the affections of his people and the blessing of his God. It is as much the interest as the duty of princes to reign in righteousness. Oppressors therefore and tyrants are the greatest fools in the world; they want understanding; they do not consult their own honour_ ease_ and safety_ but sacrifice all to their ambition of an absolute and arbitrary power. They might be much happier in the hearts of their subjects than in their necks or estates.,20250223
Wantonness and uncleanness of heart_ ver. 1-4,20250223
Was it to me that thou didst direct thy discourse? And dost thou take me for such a child as to need these instructions? Or dost thou think them proper for one in my condition?__ Every thing that is true and good is not suitable and seasonable. To one that was humbled_ and broken_ and grieved in spirit_ as Job was_ he ought to have preached of the grace and mercy of God_ rather than of his greatness and majesty_ to have laid before him the consolations rather than the terrors of the Almighty. Christ knows how to speak what is proper for the weary (Isa. l. and his ministers should learn rightly to divide the word of truth_ and not make those sad whom God would not have made sad_ as Bildad did; and therefore Job asks him_ Whose spirit came from thee? that is_ __What troubled soul would ever be revived_ and relieved_ and brought to itself_ by such discourses as these?__ Thus are we often disappointed in our expectations from our friends who should comfort us_ but the Comforter_ who is the Holy Ghost_ never mistakes in his operations nor misses of his end.,20250223
Wast thou made before the hills? No_ thou wast not. But before the hills was the eternal Word brought forth,20250223
We are all apt to be partial in judging of ourselves and our own actions_ and to think too favourably of our own character_ as if there was nothing amiss in it: Every way of a man_ even his by-way_ is right in his own eyes. The proud heart is very ingenious in putting a fair face upon a foul matter_ and in making that appear right to itself which is far from being so_ to stop the mouth of conscience,20250223
We are all apt to be partial in judging of ourselves: All the ways of a man_ all his designs_ all his doings_ are clean in his own eyes_ and he sees nothing amiss in them_ nothing for which to condemn himself_ or which should make his projects prove otherwise than well; and therefore he is confident of success_ and that the answer of the tongue shall be according to the expectations of the heart; but there is a great deal of pollution cleaving to our ways_ which we are not aware of_ or do not think so ill of as we ought,20250223
We are allowed a sober and moderate use of the delights of sense: Hast thou found honey? It is not forbidden fruit to thee_ as it was to Jonathan; thou mayest eat of it with thanksgiving to God_ who_ having created things grateful to our senses_ has given us leave to make use of them. Eat as much as is sufficient_ and no more. Enough is as good as a feast,20250223
We are apt to judge of men's blessedness_ at least in this world_ by their wealth_ and that they are more or less happy accordingly as they have more or less of this world's goods; but Solomon here shows what a gross mistake it is_ that we may be reconciled to a poor condition_ and may neither covet riches ourselves nor envy those that have abundance. 1. Those that are rich_ if by some they are respected for their riches_ yet_ to balance that_ by others they are envied and struck at_ and brought in danger of their lives_ which therefore they are forced to ransom with their riches. Slay us not_ for we have treasures in the field_ Jer. xli,20250223
We are but dust and ashes at the best_ and our bodies are vile bodies; but we are apt to forget it_ till God_ by some sore disease_ makes us sensibly to feel and own what we are. __I have become already like that dust and ashes into which I must shortly be resolved: wherever I go I carry my grave about with me.__,20250223
We are cautioned against a false and deceitful way to happiness_ and that is_ right or wrong_ raising an estate suddenly. Say not_ This is the way to abound with blessings_ for he that makes haste to be rich_ more haste than good speed_ shall not be innocent; and_ if he be not_ he shall not be blessed of God_ but rather bring a curse upon what he has; nor_ if he be not innocent_ can he long be easy to himself; he shall not be accounted innocent by his neighbours_ but shall have their ill will and ill word. He does not say that he cannot be innocent_ but there is all the probability in the world that he will not prove so: He that hasteth with his feet sinneth_ stumbleth_ falleth. Sed quæ reverentia legum_ quis metus_ aut pudor_ est unquam properantis avari?—What reverence for law_ what fear_ what shame_ was ever indicated by an avaricious man hasting to be rich?,20250223
We are cautioned against it because of the danger it exposes us to; it is like taking a snarling cur by the ears_ that will snap at you and bite you; you had better have let him alone_ for you cannot get clear of him when you would_ and must thank yourselves if you come off with a wound and dishonour. He that has got a dog by the ears_ if he lets him go he flies at him_ if he keeps his hold_ he has his hands full_ and can do nothing else. Let every one with quietness work and mind his own business_ and not with unquietness quarrel and meddle with other people's business.,20250223
We are cautioned not to dread the power of man_ neither the power of a prince nor the power of the multitude; both are formidable enough_ but the slavish fear of either brings a snare_ that is_ exposes men to many insults (some take a pride in terrifying the timorous)_ or rather exposes men to many temptations. Abraham_ for fear of man_ denied his wife_ and Peter his Master_ and many a one his God and religion. We must not shrink from duty_ nor commit sin_ to avoid the wrath of man_ nor_ though we see it coming upon us_ be disquieted with fear_ Dan. iii. 16; Ps. cxviii,20250223
We are cautioned to take heed of excess. We must use all pleasures as we do honey_ with a check upon our appetite_ lest we take more than does us good and make ourselves sick with it. We are most in danger of surfeiting upon that which is most sweet_ and therefore those that fare sumptuously every day have need to watch over themselves_ lest their hearts be at any time overcharged. The pleasures of sense lose their sweetness by the excessive use of them and become nauseous_ as honey_ which turns sour in the stomach; it is therefore our interest_ as well as our duty_ to use them with sobriety.,20250223
We are directed in the true way to be happy_ and that is to be holy and honest. He that is faithful to God and man shall be blessed of the Lord_ and he shall abound with blessings of the upper and nether springs. Men shall praise him_ and pray for him_ and be ready to do him any kindness. He shall abound in doing good_ and shall himself be a blessing to the place where he lives. Usefulness shall be the reward of faithfulness_ and it is a good reward,20250223
We are dying_ but he liveth_ and hath assured us that because he lives we shall live also_ John xiv.,20250223
We are expected in our long home: The graves are ready for me. But would not one grave serve? Yes_ but he speaks of the sepulchres of his fathers_ to which he must be gathered: __The graves where they are laid are ready for me also___ graves in consort_ the congregation of the dead. Wherever we go there is but a step between us and the grave. Whatever is unready_ that is ready; it is a bed soon made. If the graves be ready for us_ it concerns us to be ready for the graves. The graves for me (so it runs)_ denoting not only his expectation of death_ but his desire of it. __I have done with the world_ and have nothing now to wish for but a grave.__,20250223
We are here admonished concerning the government of the tongue_ that necessary duty of a Christian. 1. It is good to say little_ because in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin_ or sin doth not cease. Usually_ those that speak much speak much amiss_ and among many words there cannot but be many idle words_ which they must shortly give an account of. Those that love to hear themselves talk do not consider what work they are making for repentance; for that will be wanted_ and first or last will be had_ where there wanteth not sin,20250223
We are here assured_ for our quickening to every good word and work,20250223
We are here directed not to cast pearls before swine (Matt. vii. 6) and not to expose things sacred to the contempt and ridicule of profane scoffers. It is our duty to take all fit occasions to speak of divine things; but,20250223
We are here directed to double our guard at such a time. We must_ ,20250223
We are here forbidden to be in any thing injurious to our neighbour_ particularly in and by the forms of law_ either,20250223
We are here led to think_,20250223
We are here quickened to the study of wisdom by the consideration both of the pleasure and the profit of it. 1. It will be very pleasant. We eat honey because it is sweet to the taste_ and upon that account we call it good_ especially that which runs first from the honey-comb. Canaan was said to flow with milk and honey_ and honey was the common food of the country (Luke xxiv. 41_ even for children_ Isa. vii,20250223
We are here taught,20250223
We are here taught as before (v. 3 and ch. x. 25_ 30),20250223
We are here taught how to value men_ not by their wealth and preferment in the world_ but by their virtue.,20250223
We are here taught that in all our affairs,20250223
We are here taught to live a life of communion with God; and without controversy great is this mystery of godliness_ and of great consequence to us_ and_ as is here shown_ will be of unspeakable advantage.,20250223
We are here taught to try whether we have grace or no by enquiring how we stand affected to the means of grace. 1. Those that have grace and love it will delight in all the instructions that are given them by way of counsel; admonition_ or reproof_ by the word or providence of God; they will value a good education_ and think it not a hardship_ but a happiness_ to be under a strict and prudent discipline. Those that love a faithful ministry_ that value it_ and sit under it with pleasure_ make it to appear that they love knowledge,20250223
We are here told,20250223
We are here told whence to expect a good name. Reputation is what most have a high regard to and stand much upon. Now it is certain,20250223
We are here told_ and we may depend upon it,20250223
We are invited to her table (v. 5): Come_ eat of my bread_ that is_ taste of the true pleasures that are to be found in the knowledge and fear of God. By faith acted on the promises of the gospel_ applying them to ourselves and taking the comfort of them_ we feed_ we feast_ upon the provisions Christ has made for poor souls. What we eat and drink we make our own_ we are nourished and refreshed by it_ and so are our souls by the word of God; it has that in it which is meat and drink to those that have understanding.,20250223
We are married to Christ_ that we should bring forth unto God_ Rom. vii,20250223
We are much indebted to sparing mercy; it is bad indeed with us when we are weary of that. Let us rather say with David_ O spare me a little.,20250223
We are not only unconcerned in the government of the stars (the government they are under_ and the government they are entrusted with_ for they both rule and are ruled)_ but utterly unacquainted with it; we know not the ordinances of heaven_ v,20250223
We are not only weak_ and cannot come of ourselves any further than we are helped_ but we are naturally backward and averse to come_ and therefore must pray for those influences and operations of the Spirit_ by the power of which we are unwilling made willing_ Ps. cx,20250223
We are often surprised with the evils we were in little fear of (v. 12): Man knows not his time_ the time of his calamity_ his fall_ his death_ which_ in scripture_ is called our day and our hour.,20250223
We are ready to think every thing that concerns us should be just as we would have it; but Elihu here shows,20250223
We are really as we are with God. Those are happy_ truly happy_ for ever happy_ that obtain favour of the Lord_ though the world frown upon them_ and they find little favour with men; for in God's favour is life_ and that is the fountain of all good. On the other hand those are miserable whom he condemns_ however men may applaud them_ and cry them up; whom he condemns he condemns to the second death,20250223
We are still among Solomon's happy men_ his happy servants_ that stood continually before him to hear his wisdom; and they are the choicest of all the dictates of his wisdom_ such as were more immediately given by divine inspiration_ that are here transmitted to us_ not to be heard_ as by them_ but once_ and then liable to be mistaken or forgotten_ and by repetition to lose their beauty_ but to be read_ reviewed_ revolved_ and had in everlasting remembrance. The account we have of Solomon's apostasy from God_ in the latter end of his reign (1 Kings xi. 1)_ is the tragical part of his story; we may suppose that he spoke his Proverbs in the prime of his time_ while he kept his integrity_ but delivered his Ecclesiastes when he had grown old (for of the burdens and decays of age he speaks feelingly ch. xii.)_ and was_ by the grace of God_ recovered from his backslidings. There he dictated his observations; here he wrote his own experiences; this is what days speak_ and wisdom which the multitude of years teaches. The title of the book and the penman we shall meet with in the first verse_ and therefore shall here only observe_,20250223
We are sure that it is very ancient_ though we cannot fix the precise time either when Job lived or when the book was written. So many_ so evident_ are its hoary hairs_ the marks of its antiquity_ that we have reason to think it of equal date with the book of Genesis itself_ and that holy Job was contemporary with Isaac and Jacob; though not coheir with them of the promise of the earthly Canaan_ yet a joint-expectant with them of the better country_ that is_ the heavenly. Probably he was of the posterity of Nahor_ Abraham's brother_ whose first-born was Uz (Gen. xxii. and in whose family religion was for some ages kept up_ as appears_ Gen. xxxi. 53_ where God is called_ not only the God of Abraham_ but the God of Nahor. He lived before the age of man was shortened to seventy or eighty_ as it was in Moses's time_ before sacrifices were confined to one altar_ before the general apostasy of the nations from the knowledge and worship of the true God_ and while yet there was no other idolatry known than the worship of the sun and moon_ and that punished by the Judges_ ch. xxxi. 26-28. He lived while God was known by the name of God Almighty more than by the name of Jehovah; for he is called Shaddai—the Almighty_ above thirty times in this book. He lived while divine knowledge was conveyed_ not by writing_ but by tradition; for to that appeals are here made_ ch. viii. 8; xxi. 29; xv. 18; v. 1. And we have therefore reason to think that he lived before Moses_ because here is no mention at all of the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt_ or the giving of the law. There is indeed one passage which might be made to allude to the drowning of Pharaoh (ch. xxvi. 12): He divideth the sea with his power_ and by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab_ which name Egypt is frequently called by in scripture_ as Ps. lxxxvii. 4; lxxxix. 10; Isa. li,20250223
We are sure that it is_ for the substance of it_ a true history_ and not a romance_ though the dialogues are poetical. No doubt there was such a man as Job; the prophet Ezekiel names him with Noah and Daniel_ Ezek. xiv,20250223
We are sure that the judgment of God concerning us is according to truth. Whatever our judgment is concerning ourselves_ the Lord ponders the heart. God looks at the heart_ and judges of men according to that_ of their actions according to their principles and intentions; and his judgment of that is as exact as ours is of that which we ponder most_ and more so; he weighs it in an unerring balance_ ch. xvi. 2.,20250223
We are tempted to envy those that grow rich_ and raise their estates and families_ by such unjust courses as our consciences will by no means suffer us to use. But_ to set aside that temptation_ Solomon here shows that a man_ with prudent management_ may raise his estate and family by lawful and honest means_ with a good conscience_ and a good name_ and the blessing of God upon his industry; and_ if the other be raised a little sooner_ yet these will last a great deal longer. 1. That which is here recommended to us as having the best influence upon our outward prosperity is wisdom_ and understanding_ and knowledge; that is_ both piety towards God (for that is true wisdom) and prudence in the management of our outward affairs. We must govern ourselves in every thing by the rules of religion first and then of discretion. Some that are truly pious do not thrive in the world_ for want of prudence; and some that are prudent enough_ yet do not prosper_ because they lean to their own understanding and do not acknowledge God in their ways; therefore both must go together to complete a wise man,20250223
We are very much in the dark concerning future events and the time and season of them: Man knows not that which shall be himself; and who can tell him when or how it shall be? v,20250223
We are weak in ourselves_ but if Christ make us as horses_ strong and bold_ we need not fear what all the powers of darkness can do against us,20250223
We are with God as we are with men_ as we have our conversation in this world. Our Father judges of his children very much by their conduct one to another; and therefore a good man_ that is merciful_ and charitable_ and does good_ draws out favour from the Lord by his prayers; but a malicious man_ that devises wickedness against his neighbours_ he will condemn_ as unworthy of a place in his kingdom.,20250223
We believe that day will come_ but we do not see it_ because it is future_ and its presages are secret,20250223
We brought nothing of this world's goods into the world_ but have them from others; and it is certain that we can carry nothing out_ but must leave them to others. We come into the world naked_ not only unarmed_ but unclothed_ helpless_ shiftless_ not so well covered and fenced as other creatures. The sin we are born in makes us naked_ to our shame_ in the eyes of the holy,20250223
We cannot attain to a right understanding of God and his will_ of ourselves and our duty and interest_ by reading any books or men_ but by reading God's book and the men of God. Such is the degeneracy of human nature that there is no true wisdom to be found with any but those who are born again_ and who_ through grace_ partake of the divine nature. As for others_ even the most ingenious and industrious_ they can tell us no tidings of this lost wisdom.,20250223
We cannot attain true wisdom but by divine revelation. The Lord giveth wisdom_ Prov. ii,20250223
We cannot describe what death is_ how the knot is untied between body and soul_ nor how the spirit of a man goes upward (Eccl. iii. to be we know not what and live we know not how_ as Mr. Norris expresses; with what dreadful curiosity (says he) does the soul launch out into the vast ocean of eternity and resign to an untried abyss! Let us make it sure that the gates of heaven shall be opened to us on the other side death_ and then we need not fear the opening of the gates of death_ though it is a way we are to go but once,20250223
We cannot fathom God's designs_ nor find out the reasons of his proceedings. His judgments are a great deep. Paul attributes such immeasurable dimensions to the divine love as Zophar here attributes to the divine wisdom_ and yet recommends it to our acquaintance. Eph. iii. 18_ 19_ That you may know the breadth_ and length_ and depth_ and height_ of the love of Christ.,20250223
We cannot trust in God except in the way of duty; we are therefore taught our duty_ that we may have reason to trust in God. Nay_ this is itself one great duty we are to learn_ and a duty that is the foundation of all practical religion_ to live a life of delight in God and dependence on him. ,20250223
We cause him to hear our prayers when we not only pray_ but wrestle and strive in prayer. He loves to be pressingly importuned_ which is not the manner of men. Some read it_ __Cause me to be heard; thou hast often an opportunity of speaking to thy companions_ and they hearken to what thou sayest; speak of me to them; let my name be heard among them; let me be the subject of thy discourse.__ __One word of Christ__ (as archbishop Usher used to say) __before you part.__ No subject is more becoming_ or should be more pleasing.,20250223
We have a necessary and constant dependence upon God. All our natural actions depend upon his providence_ all our spiritual actions upon his grace. The best man is no better than God makes him; and every creature is that to us which it is the will of God that it should be. Our enterprises succeed_ not as we desire and design_ but as God directs and disposes. The goings even of a strong man (so the word signifies) are of the Lord_ for his strength is weakness without God_ nor is the battle always to the strong,20250223
We have daily instances of that; and therefore_ since thou dost thus perish and art consumed_ we have reason to think that_ whatever profession of religion thou hast made_ thou hast but ploughed iniquity and sown wickedness. Even as I have seen in others_ so do I see in thee.__,20250223
We have fasted_ Isa. lviii,20250223
We have heard what Christ has to say_ to engage our affections to God and godliness_ and one would think the whole world should go after him; but here we are told how industrious the tempter is to seduce unwary souls into the paths of sin_ and with the most he gains his point_ and Wisdom's courtship is not effectual. Now observe_,20250223
We have here Job in a post of honour and power. Though he had comfort enough in his own house_ yet he did not confine himself to that. We are not born for ourselves_ but for the public. When any business was to be done in the gate_ the place of judgment_ Job went out to it through the city (v. not in an affectation of pomp_ but in an affection to justice. Observe_ Judgment was administered in the gate_ in the street_ in the places of concourse_ to which every man might have a free access_ that every one who would might be a witness to all that was said and done_ and that when judgment was given against the guilty others might hear and fear. Job being a prince_ a judge_ a magistrate_ a man in authority_ among the children of the east_ we are here told_,20250223
We have here Job's creed_ or confession of faith. His belief in God the Father Almighty_ the Maker of heaven and earth_ and the principles of natural religion_ he had often professed: but here we find him no stranger to revealed religion; though the revelation of the promised Seed_ and the promised inheritance_ was then discerned only like the dawning of the day_ yet Job was taught of God to believe in a living Redeemer_ and to look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come_ for of these_ doubtless_ he must be understood to speak. These were the things he comforted himself with the expectation of_ and not a deliverance from his trouble or a revival of his happiness in this world_ as some would understand him; for besides that the expressions he here uses_ of the Redeemer's standing at the latter day upon the earth_ of his seeing God_ and seeing him for himself_ are wretchedly forced if they be understood of any temporal deliverance_ it is very plain that he had no expectation at all of his return to a prosperous condition in this world. He had just now said that his way was fenced up_ (v. 8) and his hope removed like a tree_ v,20250223
We have here Job's protestation against three more sins_ together with his general appeal to God's bar and his petition for a hearing there_ which_ it is likely_ was intended to conclude his discourse (and therefore we will consider it last)_ but that another particular sin occurred_ from which he thought it requisite to acquit himself. He clears himself from the charge_,20250223
We have here a further account of Job's prosperity and his piety.,20250223
We have here a particular account of Job's troubles.,20250223
We have here an account of the kind visit which Job's three friends paid him in his affliction. The news of his extraordinary troubles spread into all parts_ he being an eminent man both for greatness and goodness_ and the circumstances of his troubles being very uncommon. Some_ who were his enemies_ triumphed in his calamities_ ch. xvi. 10; xix. 18; xxx. 1_ &c. Perhaps they made ballads on him. But his friends concerned themselves for him_ and endeavoured to comfort him. A friend loveth at all times_ and a brother is born for adversity. Three of them are here named (v.,20250223
We have here an account of the way and end of a great many self-deluded souls. 1. Their way is seemingly fair: It seems right to themselves; they please themselves with a fancy that they are as they should be_ that their opinions and practices are good_ and such as will bear them out. The way of ignorance and carelessness_ the way of worldliness and earthly-mindedness_ the way of sensuality and flesh-pleasing_ seem right to those that walk in them_ much more the way of hypocrisy in religion_ external performances_ partial reformations_ and blind zeal; this they imagine will bring them to heaven; they flatter themselves in their own eyes that all will be well at last,20250223
We have here an introduction to this book_ which some think was prefixed by the collector and publisher_ as Ezra; but it is rather supposed to have been penned by Solomon himself_ who_ in the beginning of his book_ proposes his end in writing it_ that he might keep to his business_ and closely pursue that end. We are here told_,20250223
We have here before us three exhortations_ each of them enforced with a good reason:—,20250223
We have here the application of Wisdom's discourse; the design and tendency of it is to bring us all into an entire subjection to the laws of religion_ to make us wise and good_ not to fill our heads with speculations_ or our tongues with disputes_ but to rectify what is amiss in our hearts and lives. In order to this_ here is_,20250223
We have here the application of the foregoing story: __Hearken to me therefore_ and not to such seducers (v. 24); give ear to a father_ and not to an enemy.__ 1. __Take good counsel when it is given you. Let not thy heart decline to her ways (v. 25); never leave the paths of virtue_ though strait and narrow_ solitary and up-hill_ for the way of the adulteress_ though green_ and broad_ and crowded with company. Do not only keep thy feet from those ways_ but let not so much as thy heart incline to them; never harbour a disposition this way_ nor think otherwise than with abhorrence of such wicked practices as these. Let reason_ and conscience_ and the fear of God ruling in the heart_ check the inclinations of the sensual appetite. If thou goest in her paths_ in any of the paths that lead to this sin_ thou goest astray_ thou art out of the right way_ the safe way; therefore take heed_ go not astray_ lest thou wander endlessly.__ 2. __Take fair warning when it is given you.__ ,20250223
We have here the conclusion of this first part of Elihu's discourse_ in which,20250223
We have here the dignity of the soul_ the great soul of man_ that light which lighteth every man. 1. It is a divine light; it is the candle of the Lord_ a candle of his lighting_ for it is the inspiration of the Almighty that gives us understanding. He forms the spirit of man within him. It is after the image of God that man is created in knowledge. Conscience_ that noble faculty_ is God's deputy in the soul; it is a candle not only lighted by him_ but lighted for him. The Father of spirits is therefore called the Father of lights,20250223
We have here the title of this book_ showing,20250223
We have here two instances of men's folly:—1. That they bring themselves into straits and troubles_ and run themselves a-ground_ and embarrass themselves: The foolishness of man perverts his way. Men meet with crosses and disappointments in their affairs_ and things do not succeed as they expected and wished_ and it is owing to themselves and their own folly; it is their own iniquity that corrects them,20250223
We have here two very sad considerations:— 1. That corruption is woven into our nature. Sin is foolishness; it is contrary both to our right reason and to our true interest. It is in the heart; there is an inward inclination to sin_ to speak and act foolishly. It is in the heart of children; they bring it into the world with them; it is what they were shapen and conceived in. It is not only found there_ but it is bound there; it is annexed to the heart (so some); vicious dispositions cleave closely to the soul_ are bound to it as the cion to the stock into which it is grafted_ which quite alters the property. There is a knot tied between the soul and sin_ a true lover's knot; they two became one flesh. It is true of ourselves_ it is true of our children_ whom we have begotten in our own likeness. O God! thou knowest this foolishness,20250223
We have here_,20250223
We have here_ as often before_ a caution against suretiship_ as a thing both imprudent and unjust. 1. We must not associate ourselves_ nor contract an intimacy_ with men of broken fortunes_ and reputations_ who need and will urge their friends to be bound for them_ that they may cheat their neighbours to feed their lusts_ and by keeping up a little longer may do the more damage at last to those that give them credit. Have nothing to do with such; be not thou among them,20250223
We have no correspondence at all with separate souls_ nor any acquaintance with their state. It is an unknown undiscovered region to which they are removed; we can neither hear from them nor send to them. While we are here_ in a world of sense_ we speak of the world of spirits as blind men do of colours_ and when we remove thither we shall be amazed to find how much we are mistaken.,20250223
We have no foresight of future events_ and therefore know not how to forecast for them: How can a man understand his own way? How can he tell what will befal him_ since God's counsels concerning him are secret_ and therefore how can he of himself contrive what to do without divine direction? We so little understand our own way that we know not what is good for ourselves_ and therefore we must make a virtue of necessity_ and commit our way unto the Lord_ in whose hand it is_ follow the guidance and submit to the disposal of Providence.,20250223
We have no joy but in Christ_ and which we are indebted to him for.__ Gaudium in Domino—Joy in the Lord_ was the ancient salutation_ and Salus in Domino sempiterna—Eternal salvation in the Lord. ,20250223
We have now before us_ A new author_ or penman rather_ or pen (if you will) made use of by the Holy Ghost for making known the mind of God to us_ writing as moved by the finger of God (so the Spirit of God is called)_ and that is Solomon; through his hand came this book of Scripture and the two that follow it_ Ecclesiastes and Canticles_ a sermon and a song. Some think he wrote Canticles when he was very young_ Proverbs in the midst of his days_ and Ecclesiastes when he was old. In the title of his song he only writes himself Solomon_ perhaps because he wrote it before his accession to the throne_ being filled with the Holy Ghost when he was young. In the title of his Proverbs he writes himself the son of David_ king of Israel_ for then he ruled over all Israel. In the title of his Ecclesiastes he writes himself the son of David_ king of Jerusalem_ because then perhaps his influence had grown less upon the distant tribes_ and he confined himself very much in Jerusalem. Concerning this author we may observe,20250223
We have reason to suppose that in such a pious household as Job had his wife was one that had been well affected to religion_ but that now_ when all their estate and comfort were gone_ she could not bear the loss with that temper of mind that Job had; but that she should go about to infect his mind with her wretched distemper was a great provocation to him_ and he could not forbear thus showing his resentment. Note_ ,20250223
We have reason to think that Job was just now under an extraordinary impulse of the blessed Spirit_ which raised him above himself_ gave him light_ and gave him utterance_ even to his own surprise. And some observe that_ after this_ we do not find Job's discourses such passionate_ peevish_ unbecoming_ complaints of God and his providence as we have before met with: this hope quieted his spirit_ stilled the storm and_ having here cast anchor within the veil_ his mind was kept steady from this time forward. Let us observe_,20250223
We have seen what Job has to say concerning life; let us now see what he has to say concerning death_ which his thoughts were very much conversant with_ now that he was sick and sore. It is not unseasonable_ when we are in health_ to think of dying; but it is an inexcusable incogitancy if_ when we are already taken into the custody of death's messengers_ we look upon it as a thing at a distance. Job had already shown that death will come_ and that its hour is already fixed. Now here he shows_,20250223
We have seen what changes there are in the world_ and must not expect to find the world more sure to us than it has been to others. Now here Solomon shows the hand of God in all those changes; it is he that has made every creature to be that to us which it is_ and therefore we must have our eye always upon him.,20250223
We have something to say_ something to utter before God_ when we draw nigh to him in holy duties; he is one with whom we have to do_ with whom we have business of vast importance. If we come without an errand_ we shall go away without any advantage. ,20250223
We have the fathers on our side; all the ancient doctors of the church are of our opinion.__ A thing soon said_ but not so soon proved; and_ when proved_ truth is not so soon discovered and proved by it as most people imagine. David preferred right scripture-knowledge before that of antiquity (Ps. cxix. 100): I understand more than the ancients_ because I keep thy precepts. Or perhaps one or more_ if not all three_ of these friends of Job_ were older than he (ch. xxxii. and therefore they thought he was bound to acknowledge them to be in the right. This also serves contenders to make a noise with to very little purpose. If they are older than their adversaries_ and can say they knew such a thing before their opponents were born_ this will not serve to justify them in being arrogant and overbearing; for the oldest are not always the wisest_ ch. xxxii. 9.,20250223
We have the possession of inward pleasures_ the comfort of communion with God and a good conscience_ and that great peace which those have that love God's law. If we rejoice not in the Lord always_ and in hope of eternal life_ it is our own fault; and what better pleasures can we spend our years in?,20250223
We have the promise of outward prosperity_ the promise of the life that now is_ and the comforts of it_ as far as is for God's glory and our good; and who would desire them any further? ,20250223
We know but in part_ 1 Cor.,20250223
We know not how the bones are fashioned in the womb of her that is with child. We cannot describe the manner either of the formation of the body or of its information with a soul; both_ we know_ are the work of God_ and we acquiesce in his work_ but cannot_ in either_ trace the process of the operation. We doubt not of the birth of the child that is conceived_ though we know not how it is formed; nor need we doubt of the performance of the promise_ though we perceive not how things work towards it. And we may well trust God to provide for us that which is convenient_ without our anxious disquieting cares_ and therein to recompense us for our charity_ since it was without any knowledge or forecast of ours that our bodies were curiously wrought in secret and our souls found the way into them; and so the argument is the same_ and urged to the same intent_ with that of our Saviour (Matt. vi.,20250223
We know not how the clouds are poised in the air_ the balancing of them_ which is one of the wondrous works of God. They are so balanced_ so spread_ that they never rob us of the benefit of the sun (even the cloudy day is day)_ so balanced that they do not fall at once_ nor burst into cataracts or water-spouts. The rainbow is an intimation of God's favour in balancing the clouds so as to keep them from drowning the world. Nay_ so are they balanced that they impartially distribute their showers on the earth_ so that_ one time or other_ every place has its share. ,20250223
We know not how the comfortable change comes when the winter is past_ v,20250223
We know not what is the way of the Spirit_ of the wind (so some)_ we know not whence it comes_ or whither it goes_ or when it will turn; yet the seamen lie ready waiting for it_ till it turns about in favour of them; so we must do our duty_ in expectation of the time appointed for the blessing. Or it may be understood of the human soul; we know that God made us_ and gave us these souls_ but how they entered into these bodies_ are united to them_ animate them_ and operate upon them_ we know not; the soul is a mystery to itself_ no marvel then that the work of God is so to us. ,20250223
We know not what orders God has given concerning the clouds_ nor what orders he will give_ v,20250223
We left Job honourably acquitted upon a fair trial between God and Satan concerning him. Satan had leave to touch_ to touch and take_ all he had_ and was confident that he would then curse God to his face; but_ on the contrary_ he blessed him_ and so he was proved an honest man and Satan a false accuser. Now_ one would have thought_ this would be conclusive_ and that Job would never have his reputation called in question again; but Job is known to be armour of proof_ and therefore is here set up for a mark_ and brought upon his trial_ a second time.,20250223
We may be in the way of our duty and yet may miss the comfort_ for the wind bloweth where it listeth. How heavy is the accent on this repeated complaint: I sought him_ but I found him not! like that of Mary Magdalen_ They have taken away my Lord_ and I know not where they have laid him_ John xx. 13.,20250223
We may expect that our doing so will be taken as a kindness_ Ps. cxli,20250223
We may help a young man into business that we know to be honest and diligent_ and gain him credit by passing our word for him_ and so do him a great kindness without any detriment to ourselves. But,20250223
We may infer hence that a deference is to be paid_ in all civil matters_ to usages that have prevailed time out of mind and the settled constitutions of government_ in which it becomes us to acquiesce_ lest an attempt to change it_ under pretence of changing it for the better_ prove of dangerous consequence.,20250223
We may see how strong men's love of money is_ that they will love any man_ how undeserving soever he be otherwise_ if he has but a deal of money and is free with it_ so that they may hope to be the better for it. Wealth enables a man to send many presents_ make many entertainments_ and do many good offices_ and so gains him many friends_ who pretend to love him_ for they flatter him and make their court to him_ but really love what he has_ or rather love themselves_ hoping to get by him,20250223
We may see how weak men's love of one another is. He who_ while he prospered_ was beloved and respected_ if he fall into poverty is separated from his neighbour_ is not owned nor looked upon_ not visited nor regarded_ is bidden to keep his distance and told he is troublesome. Even one that has been his neighbour and acquaintance will turn his face from him and pass by on the other side. Because men's consciences tell them they ought to relieve and succour such_ they are willing to have this excuse_ that they did not see them.,20250223
We may see in Job a type of Christ_ who was thus made a reproach of men and despised of the people (Ps. xxii. 6; Isa. liii. and who hid not his face from shame and spitting_ but bore the indignity better than Job did.,20250223
We may see that it has often been the lot of very wise and good men to be trampled upon and abused. And_ 3. That those who look only at the things that are seen despise those whom the world frowns upon_ though they are ever so much the favourites of Heaven. Nothing is more grievous in poverty than that it renders men contemptible. Turba Remi sequitur fortunam_ ut semper odit damnatos—The Roman populace_ faithful to the turns of fortune_ still persecute the fallen,20250223
We may see the uncertainty of worldly honour_ and particularly of popular applause_ how suddenly a man may fail from the height of dignity into the depth of disgrace. What little cause therefore have men to be ambitious or proud of that which may be so easily lost_ and what little confidence is to be put in it! Those that to-day cry Hosannah may to-morrow cry Crucify. But there is an honour which comes from God_ which if we secure_ we shall find it not thus changeable and loseable,20250223
We might save ourselves a great deal of labour_ and prevent a great deal of danger_ if we did whet before we cut_ that is_ consider and premeditate what is fit to be said and done in every difficult case_ that we may accommodate ourselves to it and may do our work smoothly and easily both to others and to ourselves. Wisdom will direct how to sharpen and put an edge upon both ourselves and those we employ_ not to work deceitfully (Ps. lii. but to work cleanly and cleverly. The mower loses no time when he is whetting his scythe. ,20250223
We must acquaint ourselves with them; for we cannot be said to forget that which we never knew. ,20250223
We must alarm ourselves into temperance and moderation: __Put a knife to thy throat_ that is_ restrain thyself_ as it were with a sword hanging over thy head_ from all excess. Let these words_ Take heed lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness_ and so that day come upon you unawares—or those_ For all these things_ God shall bring thee into judgment—or those_ Drunkards_ shall not inherit the kingdom of God_ be a knife to the throat.__ The Latins call luxury gula—the throat. __Take up arms against that sin. Rather be so abstemious that thy craving appetite will begin to think thy throat cut than indulge thyself in voluptuousness.__ We must never feed ourselves without fear (Jude but we must in a special manner fear when temptation is before us. ,20250223
We must all of us very certainly_ and very shortly_ go this journey; and it is comfortable to those who keep a good conscience to think of it_ for it is the crown of their integrity.,20250223
We must always govern ourselves by the rules of wisdom_ of right reason and religion_ because that is the way to be always easy_ ver. 21-26.,20250223
We must apply our hearts to them_ else inclining the ear to them will stand us in no stead.,20250223
We must arm ourselves against the temptation of an oppressive government and not think it strange_ ver. 9_ 10. The impunity of oppressors makes them more daring (ver. but in the issue it will be well with the righteous and ill with the wicked (ver. 12_ and therefore the present prosperity of the wicked and afflictions of the righteous ought not to be a stumbling-block to us_ ver. 14,20250223
We must be constant to our duty because that is the way to be happy_ ver. 1-4.,20250223
We must be convinced that the words of God are the fountain and standard of wisdom and understanding_ and that we need not desire to be wiser than they will make us. We must incline our ear and apply our hearts to them_ as to wisdom or understanding itself. Many wise things may be found in human compositions_ but divine revelation_ and true religion built upon it_ are all wisdom. ,20250223
We must be dead to the wealth of this world_ that we may the more closely and earnestly apply ourselves to the business of religion. We must receive instruction as the main matter_ and then be indifferent whether we receive silver or no; nay_ we must not receive it as our portion and reward_ as the rich man in his life-time received his good things.,20250223
We must be diligent and take pains; not only sit down and contrive_ but be up and doing: __Set thy heart to thy herds_ as one in care; lay thy hands_ lay thy bones_ to thy business.__,20250223
We must be discreet and considerate in the management of our business_ know the state of things_ and look well to them_ that nothing may be lost_ no opportunity let slip_ but every thing done in proper time and order_ and so as to turn to the best advantage,20250223
We must be observant of the laws. In all those things wherein the civil power is to interpose_ whether legislative or judicial_ we ought to submit to its order and constitutions: I counsel thee; it may as well be supplied_ I charge thee_ not only as a prince but as a preacher: he might do both; __I recommend it to thee as a piece of wisdom; I say_ whatever those say that are given to change_ keep the king's commandment; wherever the sovereign power is lodged_ be subject to it. Observe the mouth of a king__ (so the phrase is); __say as he says; do as he bids thee; let his word be a law_ or rather let the law be his word.__ Some understand the following clause as a limitation of this obedience: __Keep the king's commandment_ yet so as to have a regard to the oath of God_ that is_ so as to keep a good conscience and not to violate thy obligations to God_ which are prior and superior to thy obligations to the king. Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's_ but so as to reserve pure and entire to God the things that are his.__ ,20250223
We must be pleased with our lot in this world_ and cheerfully acquiesce in the will of God concerning us_ and accommodate ourselves to it. There is no certain_ lasting_ good in these things; what good there is in them we are here told_ v. 12_ 13. We must make a good use of them,20250223
We must be very humble in our attendance on divine instructions_ and be glad of any place_ even the meanest_ so we may but be within hearing of them_ as David_ who would gladly be a door-keeper in the house of God. ,20250223
We must be willing to hear reason from those that are every way inferior to us_ and to yield to it. He that has a good eye can see further upon level ground than he that is purblind can from the top of the highest mountain. Better is a poor and wise child then an old and foolish king_ Eccl. iv. 13.,20250223
We must buy it_ that is_ be willing to part with any thing for it. He does not say at what rate we must buy it_ because we cannot buy it too dear_ but must have it at any rate; whatever it costs us_ we shall not repent the bargain. When we are at expense for the means of knowledge_ and resolved not to starve so good a cause_ then we buy the truth. Riches should be employed for the getting of knowledge_ rather than knowledge for the getting of riches. When we are at pains in searching after truth_ that we may come to the knowledge of it and may distinguish between it and error_ then we buy it. Dii laboribus omnia vendunt—Heaven concedes every thing to the laborious. When we choose rather to suffer loss in our temporal interest than to deny or neglect the truth they we buy it; and it is a pearl of such great price that we must be willing to part with all to purchase it_ must make shipwreck of estate_ trade_ preferment_ rather than of faith and a good conscience. ,20250223
We must by faith see him there_ and by prayer seek him there_ with boldness enter into the holiest_ and herein must join with the generation of those that seek him (Ps. xxiv. even with all that in every place call upon him_ 1 Cor. i,20250223
We must by patience refer ourselves and our cause to him: To God would I commit my cause; having spread it before him_ I would leave it with him; having laid it at his feet_ I would lodge it in his hand. __Here I am_ let the Lord do with me as seemeth him good.__ If our cause be indeed a good cause_ we need not fear committing it to God_ for he is both just and kind. Those that would seek so as to speed must refer themselves to God.,20250223
We must by prayer fetch in mercy and grace from God_ seek to him as a Father and friend_ though he contend with us_ as one who is alone able to support and succour us. His favour we must seek when we have lost all we have in the world; to him we must address ourselves as the fountain and Father of all good_ all consolation. Is any afflicted? let him pray. It is heart's-ease_ a salve for every sore. ,20250223
We must cheerfully use the gifts of God's providence_ ver. 15,20250223
We must conduct ourselves aright under our afflictions_ v. 11_ 12. This the apostle quotes (Heb. xii. and calls it an exhortation which speaks unto us as unto children_ with the authority and affection of a father. We are here in a world of troubles. Now observe_,20250223
We must confess the fact of sin (I have sinned) and not deny the charge_ or stand upon our own justification; we must confess the fault of sin_ the iniquity_ the dishonesty of it ( have perverted that which was right); we must confess the folly of sin—__so foolish have I been and ignorant_ for it profited me not; and therefore what have I to do any more with it?__ Is there not good reason why we should make such a penitent confession as this? For_ ,20250223
We must cry after knowledge_ as one that is ready to perish for hunger begs hard for bread. Faint desires will not prevail; we must be importunate_ as those that know the worth of knowledge and our own want of it. We must cry_ as new-born babes_ after the sincere milk of the word. 1 Pet. ii,20250223
We must depend upon the performance of the promise when all the ways leading to it are shut up_ Rom.,20250223
We must diligently attend to the word of God read and preached. __Be swift to hear the exposition which the priests give of the sacrifices_ declaring the intent and meaning of them_ and do not think it enough to gaze upon what they do_ for it must be a reasonable service_ otherwise it is the sacrifice of fools.__ ,20250223
We must do all the good we can_ and no hurt_ to our neighbours_ because according as men are just or unjust_ charitable or uncharitable_ humble or haughty_ accordingly they shall receive of God_ ver. 27-35. From all this it appears what a tendency religion has to make men both blessed and blessings.,20250223
We must do our duty with them_ and be more in care how to use an estate well_ for the ends for which we were entrusted with it_ than how to raise or increase an estate. This is intimated v. 26_ where those only are said to have the comfort of this life who are good in God's sight_ and again_ good before God_ truly good_ as Noah_ whom God saw righteous before him. We must set God always before us_ and give diligence in every thing to approve ourselves to him. The Chaldee-paraphrase says_ A man should make his soul to enjoy good by keeping the commandments of God and walking in the ways that are right before him_ and (v. 25) by studying the words of the law_ and being in care about the day of the great judgment that is to come. ,20250223
We must do that which is commendable_ for which even strangers may praise us. Our light must shine before men_ and we must do good works that may be seen_ though we must not do them on purpose that they may be seen. Let our own works be such as will praise us_ even in the gates_ Phil. iv. 8,20250223
We must draw out our souls to the hungry_ Isa. lviii. 10,20250223
We must every one of us be brought into judgment_ however we may now put far from us that evil day. ,20250223
We must get ready for sudden evils_ and especially for sudden death_ ver. 6-8,20250223
We must give our voice to understanding (so the word is)_ speak for it_ vote for it_ submit the tongue to the command of wisdom. We must consecrate our voice to it; having applied our heart to it_ we must employ our voice in seeking for it. Solomon could write probatum est—a tried remedy_ upon this method; he prayed for wisdom and so obtained it.,20250223
We must have a continual regard to God's promises_ which go along with his precepts_ and are to be received_ and retained_ with them (v. 3): __Let not mercy and truth forsake thee_ God's mercy in promising_ and his truth in performing. Do not forfeit these_ but live up to them_ and preserve thy interest in them; do not forget these_ but live upon them_ and take the comfort of them. Bind them about thy neck_ as the most graceful ornament.__ It is the greatest honour we are capable of in this world to have an interest in the mercy and truth of God. __Write to them upon the table of thy heart_ as dear to thee_ thy portion_ and most delightful entertainment; take a pleasure in applying them and thinking them over.__ Or it may be meant of the mercy and truth which are our duty_ piety and sincerity_ charity towards men_ fidelity towards God. Let these be fixed and commanding principles in thee. To encourage us to do this we are assured (v. 4) that this is the way to recommend ourselves both to our Creator and fellow-creatures: So shalt thou find favour and good understanding.,20250223
We must have a continual regard to God's providence_ must own and depend upon it in all our affairs_ both by faith and prayer. 1. By faith. We must repose an entire confidence in the wisdom_ power_ and goodness of God_ assuring ourselves of the extent of his providence to all the creatures and all their actions. We must therefore trust in the Lord with all our hearts (v. 5); we must believe that he is able to do what he will_ wise to do what is best_ and good_ according to his promise_ to do what is best for us_ if we love him_ and serve him. We must_ with an entire submission and satisfaction_ depend upon him to perform all things for us_ and not lean to our own understanding_ as if we could_ by any forecast of our own_ without God_ help ourselves_ and bring our affairs to a good issue. Those who know themselves cannot but find their own understanding to be a broken reed_ which_ if they lean to_ will certainly fail them. In all our conduct we must be diffident of our own judgment_ and confident of God's wisdom_ power_ and goodness_ and therefore must follow Providence and not force it. That often proves best which was least our own doing,20250223
We must hear afflictions well because that is the way to get good by them_ ver. 11_ 12.,20250223
We must herein acknowledge God; we must see that it is from the hand of God_ that is_ ,20250223
We must hide them with us_ as we do our treasures_ which we are afraid of being robbed of. We must not only receive_ but retain_ the word of God_ and lodge it in our hearts_ that it may be always ready to us. ,20250223
We must humble ourselves for what we have done amiss_ and even lie in the dust before God_ in sorrow for it_ as Job did_ when he repented of what he had said foolishly (ch. xl. 4_ I will lay my hand upon my mouth)_ and as the convicted leper_ who put a covering upon his upper lip. If we have done foolishly_ we must not stand to it before men_ but by silence own our guilt_ which will be the best way of appeasing those we have offended,20250223
We must improve opportunities_ we must gather when it is to be had_ as the ant does in summer and harvest_ in the proper time. It is our wisdom to improve the season while that favours us_ because that may be done then which cannot be done at all_ or not so well done_ at another time. Walk while you have the light.,20250223
We must incline our ear to them; we must lay hold on all opportunities of hearing the word of God_ and listen to it with attention and seriousness_ as those that are afraid of letting it slip. ,20250223
We must keep a watchful eye and a strict hand upon all the motions of our inward man_ v.,20250223
We must keep the evil thought we have conceived in our minds from breaking out in any evil speeches. Do not give the evil thought an imprimatur—a license; allow it not to be published; but lay thy hand upon thy mouth; use a holy violence with thyself_ if need be_ and enjoin thyself silence; as Christ suffered not the evil spirits to speak. It is bad to think ill_ but it is much worse to speak it_ for that implies a consent to the evil thought and a willingness to infect others with it.,20250223
We must keep up the fear of God because that is the way to be healthful_ ver. 7_ 8.,20250223
We must lay hold on all opportunities of getting knowledge and grace_ and must get into_ and keep in_ a constant settled course of communion with God. ,20250223
We must lay it up as a thing of great value_ that it may be safe; and we must lay it up in our hearts_ as a thing of great use_ that it may be ready to us when there is occasion and we may neither lose it wholly nor be at a loss for it in a time of need,20250223
We must lift our voice for understanding lift it up to heaven; thence these good and perfect gifts must be expected_ Jam. i. 17; Job xxxviii,20250223
We must live a life of dependence upon God because that is the way to be safe_ ver. 5.,20250223
We must maintain a holy jealousy of ourselves_ and set a strict guard_ accordingly_ upon all the avenues of the soul; keep our hearts from doing hurt and getting hurt_ from being defiled by sin and disturbed by trouble; keep them as our jewel_ as our vineyard; keep a conscience void of offence; keep out bad thoughts; keep up good thoughts; keep the affections upon right objects and in due bounds. Keep them with all keepings (so the word is); there are many ways of keeping things—by care_ by strength_ by calling in help_ and we must use them all in keeping our hearts; and all little enough_ so deceitful are they_ Jer. xvii,20250223
We must make a good use of our estates_ and that is the way to increase them_ v. 9_ 10. Here is_,20250223
We must needs be subject_ for conscience-sake_ and that is the most powerful principle of subjection. We must be subject because of the oath of God_ the oath of allegiance which we have taken to be faithful to the government_ the covenant between the king and the people_ 2 Chron. xxiii,20250223
We must never cast them off_ never think it a mighty achievement (as some do) to get clear of the restraints of a good education: __Keep thy father's commandment_ keep it still_ and never forsake it.__ ,20250223
We must never design any hurt or harm to any body (v. 29): __Devise not evil against thy neighbour; do not contrive how to do him an ill-turn undiscovered_ to prejudice him in his body_ goods_ or good name_ and the rather because he dwells securely by thee_ and_ having given thee no provocation_ entertains no jealousy or suspicion of thee_ and therefore is off his guard.__ It is against the laws both of honour and friendship to do a man an ill-turn and give him no warning. Cursed be he that smites his neighbour secretly. It is a most base ungrateful thing_ if our neighbours have a good opinion of us_ that we will do them no harm_ and we thence take advantage to cheat and injure them.,20250223
We must never lay them by_ no_ not for a time (v. 21): Bind them continually_ not only upon thy hand (as Moses had directed_ Deut. vi. 8) but upon thy heart. Phylacteries upon the hand were of no value at all_ any further than they occasioned pious thoughts and affections in the heart. There the word must be written_ there it must be hid_ and laid close to the conscience. Tie them about thy neck_ as an ornament_ a bracelet_ or gold chain_—about thy throat (so the word is); let them be a guard upon that pass; tie them about thy throat_ that no forbidden fruit may be suffered to go in nor any evil word suffered to go out through the throat; and thus a great deal of sin would be prevented. Let the word of God be always ready to us_ and let us feel the impressions of it_ as of that which is bound upon our hearts and about our necks.,20250223
We must not associate with peevish passionate people_ that are exceptions_ and apt to put the worst constructions upon everything_ that pick quarrels upon the least occasion_ and are quick_ and high_ and hot_ in resenting affronts. These are contentious men_ that kindle strife_ v.,20250223
We must not be forward to find fault with the public administration_ or quarrel with every thing that is not just according to our mind_ nor quit our post of service under the government_ and throw it up_ upon every discontent (v. 3): __Be not hasty to go out of his sight_ when he is displeased at thee (ch. x. or when thou art displeased at him; fly not off in a passion_ nor entertain such jealousies of him as will tempt thee to renounce the court or forsake the kingdom.__ Solomon's subjects_ as soon as his head was laid low_ went directly contrary to this rule_ when upon the rough answer which Rehoboam gave them_ they were hasty to go out of his sight_ would not take time for second thoughts nor admit proposals of accommodation_ but cried_ To your tents_ O Israel! __There may perhaps be a just cause to go out of his sight; but be not hasty to do it; act with great deliberation.__ ,20250223
We must not be quarrelsome and litigious (v. 30): __Do not strive with a man without cause; contend not for that which thou hast no title to; resent not that as a provocation which peradventure was but an oversight. Never trouble thy neighbour with frivolous complaints and accusations_ or vexatious law-suits_ when either there is no harm done thee or none worth speaking of_ or thou mightest right thyself in a friendly way.__ Law must be the last refuge; for it is not only our duty_ but our interest_ as much as in us lies_ to live peaceably with all men. When accounts are balanced_ it will be found there is little got by striving.,20250223
We must not be stocks_ and stones_ and stoics_ under our afflictions_ insensible of them_ hardening ourselves under them_ and concluding we can easily get through them without God. ,20250223
We must not be weary of an affliction_ be it ever so heavy and long_ not faint under it_ so the apostle renders it_ not be dispirited_ dispossessed of our own souls_ or driven to despair_ or to use any indirect means for our relief and the redress of our grievances. We must not think that the affliction either presses harder or continues longer than is meet_ not conclude that deliverance will never come because it does not come so soon as we expect it.,20250223
We must not cheat people of their money_ by striking hands ourselves_ or becoming surety for others_ when we have not to pay. If a man by the divine providence is disabled to pay his debts_ he ought to be pitied and helped; but he that takes up money or goods himself_ or is bound for another_ when he knows that he has not wherewithal to pay_ or that what he has is so settled that the creditors cannot come at it_ does in effect pick his neighbour's pocket_ and though_ in all cases_ compassion is to be used_ yet he may thank himself if the law have its course and his bed be taken from under him_ which might be taken for a pledge to secure a debt_ Exod. xxii. 26_ 27. For_ if a man appeared to be so poor that he had nothing else to give for security_ he ought to be relieved_ and it was honestly done to own it; but_ for the recovery of a debt_ it seems it might be taken by the summum jus—the strict operation of law,20250223
We must not despise an affliction_ be it ever so light and short_ as if it were not worth taking notice of_ or as if it were not sent on an errand and therefore required no answer.,20250223
We must not give ear to talebearers_ for they feed the fire of contention with fuel; nay_ they spread it with combustible matter; the tales they carry are fireballs. Those who by insinuating base characters_ revealing secrets_ and misrepresenting words and actions_ do what they can to make relations_ friends_ and neighbours_ jealous one of another_ to alienate them one from another_ and sow discord among them_ are to be banished out of families and all societies_ and then strife will as surely cease as the fire will go out when it has no fuel; the contenders will better understand one another and come to a better temper; old stories will soon be forgotten when there are no new ones told to keep up the remembrance of them_ and both sides will see how they have been imposed upon by a common enemy. Whisperers and backbiters are incendiaries not to be suffered. To illustrate this_ he repeats (v. 22) what he had said before (ch. xviii. that the words of a tale-bearer are as wounds_ deep and dangerous wounds_ wounds in the vitals. They wound the reputation of him who is belied_ and perhaps the wound proves incurable_ and even the plaster of a recantation (which yet can seldom be obtained) may not prove wide enough for it. They wound the love and charity which he to whom they are spoken ought to have for his neighbour and give a fatal stab to friendship and Christian fellowship. We must therefore not only not be tale-bearers ourselves at any time_ nor ever do any ill offices_ but we should not give the least countenance to those that are,20250223
We must not harbour in our hearts any secret discontent at the providence of God_ though it seem to smile upon them_ nor wish ourselves in their condition. __Let not thy heart imitate sinners__ (so some read it); do not as they do; walk not in the way with them; use not the methods they take to enrich themselves_ though they thrive by them,20250223
We must not persist in a fault when it is shown us: __Stand not in an evil thing; in any offence thou hast given to thy prince humble thyself_ and do not justify thyself_ for that will make the offence much more offensive. In any ill design thou hast_ upon some discontent_ conceived against thy prince_ do not proceed in it; but if thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself_ or hast thought evil_ lay thy hand upon thy mouth___ Prov. xxx,20250223
We must not ruin our own estates and families. Every man ought to be just to himself and to his wife and children; those are not so who live above what they have_ who by the mismanagement of their own affairs_ or by encumbering themselves with debts of others_ waste what they have and bring themselves to poverty. We may take joyfully the spoiling of our goods if it be for the testimony of a good conscience; but_ if be for our own rashness and folly_ we cannot but take it heavily.,20250223
We must not sell it. Do not part with it for pleasures_ honours_ riches_ any things in this world. Do not neglect the study of it_ nor throw off the profession of it_ nor revolt from under the dominion of it_ for the getting or saving of any secular interest whatsoever. Hold fast the form of sound words_ and never let it go upon any terms.,20250223
We must not think of building till we can afford it: __First apply thyself to thy work without in the field; let thy ground be put into good order; look after thy husbandry_ for it is that by which thou must get; and_ when thou hast got well by that_ then_ and not till then_ thou mayest think of rebuilding and beautifying thy house_ for that is it upon which_ and in which_ thou wilt have occasion to spend.__ Many have ruined their estates and families by laying out money on that which brings nothing in_ beginning to build when they were not able to finish. Some understand it as advice to young men not to marry (for by that the house is built) till they have set up in the world_ and not wherewith to maintain a wife and children comfortably,20250223
We must not vow that which_ through the frailty of the flesh_ we have reason to fear we shall not be able to perform_ as those that vow a single life and yet know not how to keep their vow. Hereby_ ,20250223
We must pray with and for others.,20250223
We must prefer religion before riches_ and look upon it that_ if we have the knowledge and fear of God in our hearts_ we are really more happy and better provided for every condition of life than if we had ever so much silver and gold. Wisdom is in itself_ and therefore must be in our account_ better than rubies. It will bring us in a better price_ be to us a better portion; show it forth_ and it will be a better ornament than jewels and precious stones of the greatest value. Whatever we can sit down and wish for of the wealth of this world would_ if we had it_ be unworthy to be compared with the advantages that attend serious godliness,20250223
We must prepare for hereafter_ and not mind the present time only_ not eat up all_ and lay up nothing_ but in gathering time treasure up for a spending time. Thus provident we must be in our worldly affairs_ not with an anxious care_ but with a prudent foresight; lay in for winter_ for straits and wants that may happen_ and for old age; much more in the affairs of our souls. We must provide meat and food_ that which is substantial and will stand us in stead_ and which we shall most need. In the enjoyment of the means of grace provide for the want of them_ in life for death_ in time for eternity; in the state of probation and preparation we must provide for the state of retribution. ,20250223
We must proceed and persevere in the way of our duty_ though it cost us all that is dear to us in this world_ even life itself_ Heb. xi,20250223
We must prudently accommodate ourselves to our opportunities_ both for our own relief_ if we think ourselves wronged_ and for the redress of public grievances: A wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment (v. 5); it is the wisdom of subjects_ in applying themselves to their princes_ to enquire and consider both at what season and in what manner they may do it best and most effectually_ to pacify his anger_ obtain his favour_ or obtain the revocation of any grievous measure prescribed. Esther_ in dealing with Ahasuerus_ took a deal of pains to discern both time and judgment_ and she sped accordingly. This may be taken as a general rule of wisdom_ that every thing should be well timed; and our enterprises are then likely to succeed_ when we embrace the exact opportunity for them.,20250223
We must raise our expectations of these instructions_ and hearken to them with care_ and patience_ and perseverance_ must watch and wait_ as Christ's hearers_ that hanged on him to hear him_ as the word in the original is (Luke xix. 48) and (ch. xxi. 38) came early in the morning to hear him.,20250223
We must reason ourselves into a holy contempt of the gratifications of sense: __If thou be a man given to appetite_ thou must_ by a present solution_ and an application of the terrors of the Lord_ restrain thyself. When thou art in danger of falling into any excess put a knife to thy throat; that may serve for once. But that is not enough: lay the axe to the root; mortify that appetite which has such a power over thee: Be not desirous of dainties.__ Note_ We ought to observe what is our own iniquity_ and_ if we find ourselves addicted to flesh-pleasing_ we must not only stand upon our guard against temptations from without_ but subdue the corruption within. Nature is desirous of food_ and we are taught to pray for it_ but it is lust that is desirous of dainties_ and we cannot in faith pray for them_ for frequently they are not food convenient for mind_ body_ or estate. They are deceitful meat_ and therefore David_ instead of praying for them_ prays against them_ Ps. cxli,20250223
We must receive them readily: __Incline thy ear to them (v. 20); humbly bow to them; diligently listen to them.__ The attentive hearing of the word of God is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart and a good means of carrying it on. It is to be hoped that those are resolved to do their duty who are inclined to know it. ,20250223
We must remember them so that they may be ready to us whenever we have occasion to use them. ,20250223
We must resolve to comply with the will of God as it is made known to us. Hearing is often put for obeying_ and that is it that is better than sacrifice_ 1 Sam. xv. 22; Isa. i. 15_ 16. We come in a right frame to holy duties when we come with this upon our heart_ Speak_ Lord_ for thy servant hears.,20250223
We must retain them carefully (v. 21); we must lay them before us as our rule: __Let them not depart from thy eyes; view them_ review them_ and in every thing aim to conform to them.__ We must lodge them within us_ as a commanding principle_ the influences of which are diffused throughout the whole man: __Keep them in the midst of thy heart_ as things dear to thee_ and which thou art afraid of losing.__ Let the word of God be written in the heart_ and that which is written there will remain.,20250223
We must separate ourselves from all those things which would divert us from or retard us in the pursuit_ retire out of the noise of this world's vanities_ and then seek and intermeddle with all the means and instructions of wisdom_ be willing to take pains and try all the methods of improving ourselves_ be acquainted with a variety of opinions_ that we may prove all things and hold fast that which is good.,20250223
We must serve God with our estates because that is the way to be rich_ ver. 9_ 10.,20250223
We must set a watch before the door of our lips_ that we offend not with out tongue (v.,20250223
We must take pains to obtain wisdom because that is the way to gain her_ and to gain by her_ ver. 13-20.,20250223
We must take pains_ and labour in our business_ yea_ though we labour under inconveniences. Even in summer_ when the weather is hot_ the ant is busy in gathering food and laying it up_ and does not indulge her ease_ nor take her pleasure_ as the grasshopper_ that sings and sports in the summer and then perishes in the winter. The ants help one another; if one have a grain of corn too big for her to carry home_ her neighbours will come in to her assistance. ,20250223
We must take the comfort of them. These things will not make a happiness for the soul; all the good we can have out of them is for the body_ and if we make use of them for the comfortable support of that_ so that it may be fit to serve the soul and able to keep pace with it in the service of God_ then they turn to a good account. There is therefore nothing better for a man_ as to these things_ than to allow himself a sober cheerful use of them_ according as his rank and condition are_ to have meat and drink out of them for himself_ his family_ his friends_ and so delight his senses and make his soul enjoy good_ all the good that is to be had out of them; do not lose that_ in pursuit of that good which is not to be had out of them. But observe_ He would not have us to give up business_ and take our ease_ that we may eat and drink; no_ we must enjoy good in our labour; we must use these things_ not to excuse us from_ but to make us diligent and cheerful in_ our worldly business. ,20250223
We must up and be doing now with all possible diligence_ because our doing-time will be done shortly and we know not how soon. But this we know that_ if the work of life be not done when our time is done_ we are undone for ever: __There is no work to be done_ nor device to do it_ no knowledge for speculation_ nor wisdom for practice_ in the grave whither thou goest.__ We are all going towards the grave; every day brings us a step nearer to it; when we are in the grave it will be too late to mend the errors of life_ too late to repent and make our peace with God_ too late to lay up any thing in store for eternal life; it must be done now or never. The grave is a land of darkness and silence_ and therefore there is no doing any thing for our souls there; it must be done now or never_ John xii. 35.,20250223
We must wait with patience for the full discovery of that which to us seems intricate and perplexed_ acknowledging that we cannot find out the work that God makes from the beginning to the end_ and therefore must judge nothing before the time. We are to believe that God has made all beautiful. Every thing is done well_ as in creation_ so in providence_ and we shall see it when the end comes_ but till then we are incompetent judges of it. While the picture is in drawing_ and the house in building_ we see not the beauty of either; but when the artist has put his last hand to them_ and given them their finishing strokes_ then all appears very good. We see but the middle of God's works_ not from the beginning of them (then we should see how admirably the plan was laid in the divine counsels)_ nor to the end of them_ which crowns the action (then we should see the product to be glorious)_ but we must wait till the veil be rent_ and not arraign God's proceedings nor pretend to pass judgment on them. Secret things belong not to us. Those words_ He has set the world in their hearts_ are differently understood. 1. Some make them to be a reason why we may know more of God's works than we do; so Mr. Pemble: __God has not left himself without witness of his righteous_ equal_ and beautiful ordering of things_ but has set it forth_ to be observed in the book of the world_ and this he has set in men's hearts_ given man a large desire_ and a power_ in good measure_ to comprehend and understand the history of nature_ with the course of human affairs_ so that_ if men did but give themselves to the exact observation of things_ they might in most of them perceive an admirable order and contrivance.__ 2. Others make them to be a reason why we do not know so much of God's works as we might; so bishop Reynolds: __We have the world so much in our hearts_ are so taken up with thoughts and cares of worldly things_ and are so exercised in our travail concerning them_ that we have neither time nor spirit to eye God's hand in them.__ The world has not only gained possession of the heart_ but has formed prejudices there against the beauty of God's works.,20250223
We must with an entire satisfaction acquiesce in the will of God_ and_ not pretending to find the bottom_ we must humbly and silently adore the depth of his unsearchable counsels_ being assured they are all wise_ just_ and good_ ver. 16_ 17.,20250223
We must_ accordingly_ receive the word of God with all readiness of mind_ and bid it welcome_ even the commandments as well as the promises_ without murmuring or disputing. Speak_ Lord_ for thy servant hears. ,20250223
We ought rightly and fully to understand our business_ and know what we have to do_ and not meddle with that which we do not understand,20250223
We ought therefore to wait upon the Spirit of grace for his quickening influences_ to pray for them_ and to lay our souls under them. God has promised to give us his Spirit_ but he will for this be enquired of.,20250223
We ought to be observers of the thoughts and intents of our own hearts_ and to judge of ourselves by them; for they are the first-born of the soul_ that have most of its image undisguised. Right thoughts are a righteous man's best evidences_ as nothing more certainly proves a man wicked than wicked contrivances and designs. A good man may have in his mind bad suggestions_ but he does not indulge them and harbour them till they are ripened into bad projects and resolutions,20250223
We ought to have an eye to it ourselves_ and not turn over all the care of it to others. We should_ with our own eyes_ inspect the state of our flocks_ it is the master's eye that makes them fat,20250223
We ought to take notice of our own spiritual slumbers and distempers_ and to reflect upon it with sorrow and shame that we have fallen asleep when Christ has been nigh us in his garden. ,20250223
We prepare confusion for ourselves by our vain hopes: the reeds break under us because we lean upon them. If we build a house upon the sand_ we shall certainly be confounded_ for it will fall in the storm_ and we must thank ourselves for being such fools as to expect it would stand. We are not deceived unless we deceive ourselves.,20250223
We read of the glory of Lebanon (Isa. xxxv. 2) and its goodly smell_ Hos. xiv,20250223
We read of the harvest of the river_ Isa. xxiii.,20250223
We read of the pleasant dew of Hermon (Ps. cxxxiii. 3) and the joy of Hermon (Ps.,20250223
We shall be enabled still to do yet more good: He that waters_ even he shall be as rain (so some read it); he shall be recruited as the clouds are which return after the rain_ and shall be further useful and acceptable_ as the rain to the new-mown grass. he that teaches shall learn (so the Chaldee reads it); he that uses his knowledge in teaching others shall himself be taught of God; to him that has_ and uses what he has_ more shall be given.,20250223
We shall be reckoned with for all our carnal mirth and sensual pleasures in that day. ,20250223
We shall have the recompence of it both from God and man: He that waters others with the streams of his bounty shall be also watered himself; God will certainly return it in the dews_ in the plentiful showers_ of his blessing_ which he will pour out_ till there be not room enough to receive it_ Mal. iii,20250223
We shall know how to conduct ourselves aright towards all men (v. 9): __Thou shalt understand_ by the word of God_ righteousness_ and judgment_ and equity_ shalt learn those principles of justice_ and charity_ and fair dealing_ which shall guide and govern thee in the whole course of thy conversation_ shall make thee fit for every relation_ every business_ and faithful to every trust. It shall give thee not only a right notion of justice_ but a disposition to practise it_ and to render to all their due; for those that do not do justly do not rightly understand it.__ This will lead them in every good path_ for the scripture will make the man of God perfect. Note_ Those have the best knowledge who know their duty_ Ps. cxi. 10.,20250223
We shall know how to maintain our acquaintance and communion with God: __Thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord (v. that is_ thou shalt know how to worship him aright_ shalt be led into the meaning and mystery of every ordinance_ and be enabled to answer the end of its institution.__ Thou shalt find the knowledge of God_ which is necessary to our fearing him aright. It concerns us to understand how much it is our interest to know God_ and to evidence it by agreeable affections towards him and adorations of him,20250223
We shall run ourselves into endless mistakes: __Thou wilt be found a liar_ a corrupter of the word of truth_ a broacher of heresies_ and guilty of the worst of forgeries_ counterfeiting the broad seal of heaven_ and pretending a divine mission and inspiration_ when it is all a cheat. Men may be thus deceived_ but God is not mocked.__,20250223
We shall see of what vast consequence it is to us that we be religious if we consider the account we must every one of us shortly give of himself to God; thence he argued against a voluptuous and vicious life (ch. xi. and here for a religious life: God shall bring every work into judgment. Note,20250223
We should never have come into the banqueting-house_ never have been acquainted with spiritual pleasures_ if Christ had not brought us_ by opening for us a new and living way and opening in us a new and living fountain,20250223
We should reckon that the most pleasant conversation which is about spiritual things_ and promotes the prosperity of the soul. ,20250223
We should say and do all we can to strengthen them_ suggesting to them such considerations as are proper to encourage their confidence in God and to support their sinking spirits. Faith and patience are the strength of the afflicted; whatever helps these graces confirms the feeble knees. ,20250223
We should show ourselves backward to say that which we foresee will be grievous_ though ever so necessary. God himself_ though he afflicts justly_ does not afflict willingly_ Lam. iii. 33 With what assurance he speaks of the truth and pertinency of what he was about to say: Who can withhold himself from speaking? Surely it was a pious zeal for God's honour_ and the spiritual welfare of Job_ that laid him under this necessity of speaking. __Who can forbear speaking in vindication of God's honour_ which we hear reproved_ in love to thy soul_ which we see endangered?__ Note_ It is foolish pity not to reprove our friends_ even our friends in affliction_ for what they say or do amiss_ only for fear of offending them. Whether men take it well or ill_ we must with wisdom and meekness do our duty and discharge a good conscience. He exhibits a twofold charge against Job.,20250223
We sin even in our doing good; there is something defective_ nay_ something offensive_ in our best performances. That which_ for the substance of it_ is good_ and pleasing to God_ is not so well done as it should be_ and omissions in duty are sins_ as well as omissions of duty. ,20250223
We speak wisely when we speak seasonably: The answer of the mouth will be our credit and joy when it is pertinent and to the purpose_ and is spoken in due season_ when it is needed and will be regarded_ and_ as we say_ hits the joint. Many a good word comes short of doing the good it might have done_ for want of being well-timed. Nor is any thing more the beauty of discourse than to have a proper answer ready off-hand_ just when there is occasion for it_ and it comes in well,20250223
We were not then born_ nor is the number of our days so great that we can describe the birth of that first-born of the visible creation_ v,20250223
We will suppose them to be rich in money and plate_ in clothing and furniture. They heap up silver in abundance as the dust_ and prepare raiment as the clay; they have heaps of clothes about them_ as plentiful as heaps of clay. Or it intimates that they have such abundance of clothes that they are even a burden to them. They lade themselves with thick clay_ Hab. ii,20250223
We will suppose them to have built themselves strong and stately houses; but they are like the house which the moth makes for herself in an old garment_ out of which she will soon be shaken_,20250223
We wish this were always true as a proposition_ and we ought to make it our prayer for kings_ and all in authority_ that a divine sentence may be in their lips_ both in giving orders_ that they may do that in wisdom_ and in giving sentence_ that they may do that in equity_ both which are included in judgment_ and that in neither their mouth may transgress_ 1 Tim. ii. 1. But it is often otherwise; and therefore,20250223
Wealth to a worldling is like drink to one in a dropsy_ which does but increase the thirst. Some read the whole verse thus: Though all a man's labour fall out to his own mind (ori ejus obveniat—so as to correspond with his views_ Juv.)_ just as himself would have it_ yet his desire is not satisfied_ still he has a mind to something more,20250223
Weighty Sayings.,20250223
Welcome nothing_ once in seven years. Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator—When a traveller is met by a robber he will rejoice at not having much property about him.,20250223
What Christ is pleased to compare himself to; and he condescends very much in the comparison. He that is the Son of the Highest_ the bright and morning star_ calls and owns himself the rose of Sharon_ and the lily of the valleys_ to express his presence with his people in this world_ the easiness of their access to him_ and the beauty and sweetness which they find in him_ and to teach them to adorn themselves with him_ as shepherds and shepherdesses_ when they appeared gay_ were decked with roses and lilies_ garlands and chaplets of flowers. The rose_ for beauty and fragrance_ is the chief of flowers_ and our Saviour prefers the clothing of the lily before that of Solomon in all his glory. Christ is the rose of Sharon_ where probably the best roses grew and in most plenty_ the rose of the field (so some)_ denoting that the gospel salvation is a common salvation; it lies open to all; whoever will may come and gather the rose-buds of privileges and comforts that grow in the covenant of grace. He is not a rose locked up in a garden_ but all may come and receive benefit by him and comfort in him. He is a lily for whiteness_ a lily of the valleys for sweetness_ for those which we call so yield a strong perfume. He is a lily of the valleys_ or low places_ in his humiliation_ exposed to injury. Humble souls see most beauty in him. Whatever he is to others_ to those that are in the valleys he is a lily. He is the rose_ the lily; there is none besides. Whatever excellence is in Christ_ it is in him singularly and in the highest degree.,20250223
What God can do with us. He can soon bring us to dust; there needs not any positive act of his omnipotence to do it; if he do but withdraw that concurrence of his providence by which we live_ if he gather unto himself that spirit and breath which was from his hand at first and is still in his hand_ we expire immediately_ like an animal in an air-pump when the air is exhausted. ,20250223
What God does for them. Some way or other he provides for them_ so that they grow up_ and come to maturity. And he that takes this care of the young ravens certainly will not be wanting to his people or theirs. This_ being but one instance of many of the divine compassion_ may give us occasion to think how much good our God does_ every day_ beyond what we are aware of.,20250223
What God does_ it shall be for ever (Eccl. iii. 14); and therefore_ as we cannot find fault with God's work_ so we need not be in fear concerning it; it will last_ and answer the end_ the works of his providence as well as the work of creation; the measures of neither can never be broken; and the work of redemption is no less firm_ of which Christ himself is both the foundation and the corner-stone. The church stands as fast as the earth.,20250223
What God had done for Job. He had protected him_ made a hedge about him_ for the defence of his person_ his family_ and all his possessions. Note_ God's peculiar people are taken under his special protection_ they and all that belong to them; divine grace makes a hedge about their spiritual life_ and divine providence about their natural life_ so they are safe and easy. He had prospered him_ not in idleness or injustice (the devil could not accuse him of them)_ but in the way of honest diligence: Thou hast blessed the work of his hands. Without that blessing_ be the hands ever so strong_ ever so skilful_ the work will not prosper; but_ with that_ his substance has wonderfully increased in the land. The blessing of the Lord makes rich: Satan himself owns it,20250223
What Job had said of man's utter inability to contend with God he here applies to himself_ and in effect despairs of gaining his favour_ which (some think) arises from the hard thoughts he had of God_ as one who_ having set himself against him_ right or wrong_ would be too hard for him. I rather think it arises from the sense he had of the imperfection of his own righteousness_ and the dark and cloudy apprehensions which at present he had of God's displeasure against him.,20250223
What a check does this give to politic designing men_ who think they can outwit all mankind_ that there is a God in heaven that laughs at them! Ps. ii,20250223
What a comfort it would be to him if herein he answered his expectation: __If thy heart be wise_ my heart shall rejoice_ shall rejoice in thee_ even mine_ who have taken so much care and pains about thee_ my heart_ that has many a time ached for thee_ for which thou shouldst study thus to make a grateful requital.__ Note_ The wisdom of children will be the joy of their parents and teachers_ who have no greater joy than to see them walk in the truth_ 3 John 4. __Children_ if you be wise and good_ devout and conscientious_ God will be pleased with you_ and that will be our joy: we shall think our labour in instructing you well bestowed; it will be a comfortable answer for the many prayers we have put up for you; we shall be eased of a great deal of care_ shall not need to be so strict and severe in watching over you_ and shall consequently be the easier both to you and to ourselves. We shall rejoice in hope that you will be a credit and comfort to us_ if we should live to be old_ that you will bear up the name of Christ in your generation_ that you will live comfortably in this world and happily in another.__,20250223
What a deal of advantage a wise man has above a fool in the management of business (v.,20250223
What a deference he paid to his seniors_ and what great expectations he had from them_ (v. 7): I said_ Days should speak. Note_ Age and experience give a man great advantage in judging of things_ both as they furnish a man with so much the more matter for his thoughts to work upon and as they ripen and improve the facilities he is to work with_ which is a good reason why old people should take pains both to learn themselves and to teach others (else the advantages of their age are a reproach to them)_ and why young people should attend on their instructions. It is a good lodging with an old disciple_ Acts xxi. 16; Tit. ii,20250223
What a diffidence he had of himself and of his own judgment (v. 6): __I am young_ and therefore I was afraid_ and durst not show you my opinion_ for fear I should either prove mistaken or do that which was unbecoming me.__ He was so observant of all that passed_ and applied his mind so closely to what he heard_ that he had formed in himself a judgment of it. He neither neglected it as foreign_ nor declined it as intricate; but_ how clear soever the matter was to himself_ he was afraid to deliver his mind upon it_ because he differed in his sentiments from those that were older than he. Note_ It becomes us to be suspicious of our own judgment in matters of doubtful disputation_ to be swift to hear the sentiments of others and slow to speak our own_ especially when we go contrary to the judgment of those for whom_ upon the score of their learning and piety_ we justly have a veneration,20250223
What a dread he had of this sin_ and what frightful apprehensions he had concerning the malignity of it—that it was a heinous crime (v. one of the greatest vilest sins a man can be guilty of_ highly provoking to God_ and destructive to the prosperity of the soul. With respect to the mischievousness of it_ and the punishment it deserved_ he owns that_ if he were guilty of that heinous crime_ ,20250223
What a friend God is to our welfare: He speaketh to us once_ yea_ twice_ v,20250223
What a great affliction it is to a man to have a brawling scolding woman for his wife_ who upon every occasion_ and often upon no occasion_ breaks out into a passion_ and chides either him or those about her_ is fretful to herself and furious to her children and servants_ and_ in both_ vexatious to her husband. If a man has a wide house_ spacious and pompous_ this will embitter the comfort of it to him—a house of society (so the word is)_ in which a man may be sociable_ and entertain his friends; this will make both him and his house unsociable_ and unfit for enjoyments of true friendship. It makes a man ashamed of his choice and his management_ and disturbs his company,20250223
What a great deal of care and pains worldly men take to get riches. He had observed concerning the wicked man (ch. xxvii. 16) that he heaped up silver as the dust; now here he shows whence that silver came which he was so fond of and how it was obtained_ to show what little reason wicked rich men have to be proud of their wealth and pomp. Observe here_,20250223
What a great deal of good he did in his place. He was very serviceable to his country with the power he had; and here we shall see what it was which Job valued himself by in the day of his prosperity. It is natural to men to have some value for themselves_ and we may judge something of our own character by observing what that is upon which we value ourselves. Job valued himself_ not by the honour of his family_ the great estate he had_ his large income_ his full table_ the many servants he had at his command_ the ensigns of his dignity_ his equipage and retinue_ the splendid entertainments he gave_ and the court that was made to him_ but by his usefulness. Goodness is God's glory_ and it will be ours; if we are merciful as God is_ we are perfect as he is.,20250223
What a great deal of vanity and vexation of spirit attends human life. If we had not a God to serve in this world_ and better things to hope for in another world_ considering the faculties we are endued with and the troubles we are surrounded with_ we should be strongly tempted to wish that we had died from the womb_ which would have prevented a great deal both of sin and misery.,20250223
What a great sin those are guilty of who trample upon the poor_ who ridicule their wants and the meanness of their appearance_ upbraid them with their poverty_ and take advantage from their weakness to be abusive and injurious to them. They reproach their Maker_ put a great contempt and affront upon him_ who allotted the poor to the condition they are in_ owns them_ and takes care of them_ and can_ when he pleases_ reduce us to that condition. Let those that thus reproach their Maker know that they shall be called to an account for it_ Matt. xxv. 40_ 41; Prov. xiv. 31,20250223
What a great way the wit of man may go in diving into the depths of nature and seizing the riches of it_ what a great deal of knowledge and wealth men may_ by their ingenious and industrious searches_ make themselves masters of. But does it therefore follow that men may_ by their wit_ comprehend the reasons why some wicked people prosper and others are punished_ why some good people prosper and others are afflicted? No_ by no means. The caverns of the earth may be discovered_ but not the counsels of heaven,20250223
What a holy security and serenity of mind those enjoy who keep conscience void of offence and so keep themselves in the love of God: The righteous are bold as a lion_ as a young lion; in the greatest dangers they have a God of almighty power to trust to. Therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed. Whatever difficulties they meet with in the way of their duty_ they are not daunted by them. None of those things move me.,20250223
What a just prospect he had of the continuance of his comfort at home (ver. 18-20) and of his interest abroad_ ver. 21-25. All this he enlarges upon_ to aggravate his present calamities; like Naomi_ __I went out full___ but am brought __home again empty.__,20250223
What a merciful and tender care divine Providence took of us at our entrance into the world. It was owing to this that we died not from the womb and did not give up the ghost when we came out of the belly. Why were we not cut off as soon as we were born? Not because we did not deserve it. Justly might such weeds have been plucked up as soon as they appeared; justly might such cockatrices have been crushed in the egg. Nor was it because we did_ or could_ take any care of ourselves and our own safety: no creature comes into the world so shiftless as man. It was not our might_ or the power of our hand_ that preserved us these beings_ but God's power and providence upheld our frail lives_ and his pity and patience spared our forfeited lives. It was owing to this that the knees prevented us. Natural affection is put into parents' he arts by the hand of the God of nature: and hence it was that the blessings of the breast attended those of the womb,20250223
What a powerful thing it is. It is of such force that it perverts the ways of judgment. The course of justice is not only obstructed_ but turned into injustice; and the greatest wrongs are done under colour of doing right.,20250223
What a weak and helpless creature man is when he comes into the world_ and how slender the thread of life is when it is first drawn. We are ready to die from the womb_ and to breathe our last as soon as we begin to breathe at all. We can do nothing for ourselves_ as other creatures can_ but should drop into the grave if the knees did not prevent us; and the lamp of life_ when first lighted_ would go out of itself if the breasts given us_ that we should suck_ did not supply it with fresh oil,20250223
What abundance of good he did in his place_ as a magistrate_ ver. 11-17,20250223
What an abominable thing sin is_ and how hateful sometimes it is made to appear_ even to the sinner himself. When his conscience is convinced_ or he feels smart from his sin_ he is sick of it_ and vomits it up; he seems then to detest it and to be willing to part with it. It is in itself_ and_ first or last_ will be to the sinner_ more loathsome than the vomit of a dog_ Ps. xxxvi,20250223
What an empty place is this world in comparison with the other! ,20250223
What an evil thing bribery is: He is a wicked man that will take a gift to engage him to give a false testimony_ verdict_ or judgment; when he does it he is ashamed of it_ for he takes it_ with all the secresy imaginable_ out of the bosom where he knows it is laid ready for him; it is industriously concealed_ and so slyly that_ if he could_ he would hide it from his own conscience. A gift is taken out of the bosom of a wicked man (so some read it); for he is a bad man that gives bribes_ as well as he that takes them,20250223
What are the effects of that wrath? They die in youth_ and their life is among the unclean_ v,20250223
What can I say against that which God does? If I go about to reason with him_ he will certainly be too hard for me.__ If the potter make the clay into a vessel of dishonour_ or break in pieces the vessel he has made_ shall the clay or the broken vessel reason with him? So absurd is the man who replies against God_ or thinks to talk the matter out with him. No_ let all flesh be silent before him.,20250223
What care she was in that no disturbance might be given him (v. 5); she repeats the charge she had before given (ch. ii. 7) to the daughters of Jerusalem not to stir up or awake her love. When she had brought him into her mother's house_ among her sisters_ she gives them a strict charge to keep all quiet and in good order_ to be very observant of him_ careful to please him_ and afraid of offending him. The charge given to the church in the wilderness concerning the angel of the covenant_ who was among them_ explains this. Exod. xxiii. 21_ Beware of him and obey his voice; provoke him not. See that none of you stir out of your places_ lest you disturb him_ but with quietness work and mind your own business; make no noise; let all clamour and bitterness be put far from you_ for that grieves the Holy Spirit of God_ Eph. iv. 30_ 31. Some make this to be Christ's charge to the daughters of Jerusalem not to disturb or disquiet his church_ nor trouble the minds of the disciples; for Christ is very tender of the peace of his church_ and all the members of it_ even the little ones; and those that trouble them shall bear their judgment_ Gal. v. 10.,20250223
What comfort and satisfaction he had in his house and family_ ver. 1-6.,20250223
What comfort does this speak to all God's people_ that all God's purposes_ which we are sure are right and good_ shall be accomplished in due time!,20250223
What comfort those have in God whose neighbours unjustly condemn them: if they may not speak to them with any hopes of a fair hearing_ yet they may speak to the Almighty; they have easy access to him and shall find acceptance with him.,20250223
What confidence those have towards God whose hearts condemn them not of reigning hypocrisy: they can_ with humble boldness_ appear before him and appeal to him,20250223
What continual frights those are subject to that go on in wicked ways. Guilt in the conscience makes men a terror to themselves_ so that they are ready to flee when none pursues; like one that absconds for debt_ who thinks every one he meets a bailiff. Though they pretend to be easy_ there are secret fears which haunt them wherever they go_ so that they fear where no present or imminent danger is_ Ps. liii,20250223
What course she took in this condition. She did not sink into despair_ and conclude that she should die of her disease_ but she sent after her beloved; she asked the advice of her neighbours_ and begged their prayers for her_ that they would intercede with him on her behalf. __Tell him_ though I was careless_ and foolish_ and slothful_ and rose not up so soon as I should have done to open to him_ yet I love him; he knows all things_ he knows that I do. Represent me to him as sincere_ though in many instances coming short of my duty; nay_ represent me to him as sincere_ though in many instances coming short of my duty; nay_ represent me as an object of his pity_ that he may have compassion on me and help me.__ She does not bid them tell him how the watchmen had abused her; how unrighteous soever they were in it_ she acknowledges that the Lord is righteous_ and therefore bears it patiently. __But tell him that I am wounded with love to him.__ Gracious souls are more sensible of Christ's withdrawings than of any other trouble whatsoever.,20250223
What distress the young ravens are often in: They wander for lack of meat. The old ones_ they say_ neglect them_ and do not provide for them as other birds do for their young: and indeed those that are ravenous to others are commonly barbarous to their own_ and unnatural. ,20250223
What encouragement we have to do so. ,20250223
What enemies we are to our own welfare: Man perceives it not_ that is_ he does not heed it or regard it_ does not discern or understand it_ is not aware that it is the voice of God_ nor does he receive the things revealed_ for they are foolishness to him; he stops his ear_ stands in his own light_ rejects the counsel of God against himself_ and so is never the wiser_ no not for the dictates of wisdom itself. God speaks to us by conscience_ by providences_ and by ministers_ of all which Elihu here discourses at large_ to show Job that God was both telling him his mind and doing him a kindness_ even now that he seemed to keep him in the dark and so treat him as a stranger_ and to keep him in distress and so treat him as an enemy. There was not then_ that we know of_ any divine revelation in writing_ and therefore that is not here mentioned among the ways by which God speaks to men_ though now it is the principal way.,20250223
What excuse can Satan make for the failure of his former attempt? What can he say to palliate it_ when he had been so very confident that he should gain his point? Why_ truly_ he has this to say_ Skin for skin_ and all that a man has_ will he give for his life. Something of truth there is in this_ that self-love and self-preservation are very powerful commanding principles in the hearts of men. Men love themselves better than their nearest relations_ even their children_ that are parts of themselves_ will not only venture_ but give_ their estates to save their lives. All account life sweet and precious_ and_ while they are themselves in health and at ease_ they can keep trouble from their hearts_ whatever they lose. We ought to make a good use of this consideration_ and_ while God continues to us our life and health and the use of our limbs and senses_ we should the more patiently bear the loss of other comforts. See Matt. vi,20250223
What good use we should make of the wisdom God gives us; we must use it for our own guidance in the paths of virtue_ and for the arming of us against temptations of every kind,20250223
What good we have an opportunity of doing we must do while we have the opportunity_ and do it with our might_ with care_ vigour_ and resolution_ whatever difficulties and discouragements we may meet with in it. Harvest-days are busy days; and we must make hay while the sun shines. Serving God and working out our salvation must be done with all that is within us_ and all little enough. ,20250223
What great advantage true wisdom will be of to us; it will keep us from the paths of sin_ which lead to ruin_ and will therein do us a greater kindness than if it enriched us with all the wealth of the world,20250223
What great conscience Job had made of his duty as a magistrate_ or a man of reputation_ in the place where he lived. He did not_ he durst not_ keep silence when he had a call to speak in an honest cause_ or keep within doors when he had a call to go abroad to do good. The case may be such that it may be our sin to be silent and retired_ as when we are called to reprove sin and bear our testimony against it_ to vindicate the truths and ways of God_ to do justice to those who are injured or oppressed_ or in any way to serve the public or to do honour to our religion,20250223
What great danger those are in of falling into trouble themselves who are pleased to see and hear of the troubles of others: He that is glad at calamities_ that he may be built up upon the ruins of others_ and regales himself with the judgments of God when they are abroad_ let him know that he shall not go unpunished; the cup shall be put into his hand_ Ezek. xxv. 6_ 7.,20250223
What great things are here said of God_ designed to possess Job with a reverence of him_ and to check his reflections upon him and upon his dealings with him: ,20250223
What great things he promises himself from it_ intimated in the rivers_ the floods_ the brooks of honey and butter (v. 17); his being disappointed of them supposes that he had flattered himself with the hopes of them: he expected rivers of sensual delights.,20250223
What ground we have to hope for this success in our pursuits of wisdom; we must take our encouragement herein from God only_ v. 6-8.,20250223
What has man of all his labour? What has he to himself and to his own use? What has he that will go with him into another world?,20250223
What have thy prayers procured but woe and pain? Hast thou not yet thy int'rest understood?,20250223
What hazards they run. Those that dig in the mines have their lives in their hands; for they are obliged to bind the floods from overflowing (v. and are continually in danger of being suffocated by damps or crushed or buried alive by the fall of the earth upon them. See how foolish man adds to his own burden. He is sentenced to eat bread in the sweat of his face; but_ as if that were not enough_ he will get gold and silver at the peril of his life_ though the more is gotten the less valuable it is. In Solomon's time silver was as stones. But_ 4. Observe what it is that carries men through all this toil and peril: Their eye sees every precious thing_ v,20250223
What he argues for_ not only the bearing_ but the receiving of evil: Shall we not receive evil_ that is_ ,20250223
What he argues from: __Shall we receive so much good as has come to us from the hand of God during all those years of peace and prosperity that we have lived_ and shall we not now receive evil_ when God thinks fit to lay it on us?__ Note_ The consideration of the mercies we receive from God_ both past and present_ should make us receive our afflictions with a suitable disposition of spirit. If we receive our share of the common good in the seven years of plenty_ shall we not receive our share of the common evil in the years of famine? Qui sentit commodum_ sentire debet et onus—he who feels the privilege_ should prepare for the privation. If we have so much that pleases us_ why should we not be content with that which pleases God? If we receive so many comforts_ shall we not receive some afflictions_ which will serve as foils to our comforts_ to make them the more valuable (we are taught the worth of mercies by being made to want them sometimes)_ and as allays to our comforts_ to make them the less dangerous_ to keep the balance even_ and to prevent our being lifted up above measure? 2 Cor. xii,20250223
What he depends upon God for—justification and salvation_ the two great things we hope for through Christ. ,20250223
What he dreams of_ and pretends to dread—a lion in the way. When he is pressed to be diligent_ either in his worldly affairs or in the business of religion_ this is his excuse (and a sorry excuse it is_ as bad as none)_ There is a lion in the way_ some insuperable difficulty or danger which he cannot pretend to grapple with. Lions frequent woods and deserts; and_ in the day-time_ when man has business to do_ they are in their dens_ Ps. civ. 22_,20250223
What he has unjustly swallowed he shall be compelled to disgorge (v. 15): He swallowed down riches_ and then thought himself sure of them_ and that they were as much his own as the meat he had eaten; but he was deceived: he shall vomit them up again; his own conscience perhaps may make him so uneasy in the keeping of what he has gotten that_ for the quiet of his own mind_ he shall make restitution_ and that not with the pleasure of a virtue_ but the pain of a vomit_ and with the utmost reluctancy. Or_ if he do not himself refund what he has violently taken away_ God will_ by his providence_ force him to it_ and bring it about_ one way or other_ that ill-gotten goods shall return to the right owners: God shall cast them out of his belly_ while yet the love of the sin is not cast out of his heart. So loud shall the clamours of the poor_ whom he has impoverished_ be against him_ that he shall be forced to send his children to them to soothe them and beg their pardon (v.,20250223
What he is pleased to compare his church to_ v,20250223
What he may do with us without doing us wrong. He may recall the being he gave_ of which we are but tenants at will_ and which also we have forfeited; and therefore_ as long as that is continued of his mere favour_ we have no reason to cry out of wrong_ whatever other comforts are removed.,20250223
What he purchased he paid for_ as Abraham for the land he bought (Gen. xxiii. and David_ 2 Sam. xxiv,20250223
What he said. We may conjecture that Elihu_ or some other of the auditory_ wrote down verbatim what was delivered out of the whirlwind_ for we find (Rev. x. 4) that_ when the thunders uttered their voices_ John was prepared to write. Or_ if it was not written then_ yet_ the penman of the book being inspired by the Holy Ghost_ we are sure that we have here a very true and exact report of what was said. The Spirit (says Christ) shall bring to your remembrance_ as he did here_ what I have said to you. The preface is very searching. ,20250223
What he would teach them: __That which is with the Almighty___ that is_ __the counsels and purposes of God concerning wicked people_ which are hidden with him_ and which you cannot hastily judge of; and the usual methods of his providence concerning them.__ This_ says Job_ will I not conceal. What God has not concealed from us we must not conceal from those we are concerned to teach. Things revealed belong to us and our children,20250223
What her condition was. She loved Jesus Christ to such a degree that his absence made her sick_ extremely sick_ she could not bear it_ and she was in pain for his return as a woman in travail_ as Ahab for Naboth's vineyard_ which he so passionately coveted. This is a sickness which is a sign of a healthy constitution of soul_ and will certainly end well_ a sickness that will not be death_ but life. It is better to be sick of love to Christ than at ease in love to the world. ,20250223
What his confession itself is; what are the words which he would have to be written; we here have them written_ v. 25-27. Let us observe them.,20250223
What his parents taught him he teaches others. Observe_ ,20250223
What his punishment is for this wickedness.,20250223
What his soul desireth even that he doeth; now he says_ with pleasure and satisfaction_ that God's counsels shall stand. If God's thoughts concerning us be thoughts of good_ to give us an unexpected end_ he cannot be withheld from accomplishing his gracious purposes_ whatever difficulties may seem to lie in the way.,20250223
What in the summer they had lost before:,20250223
What inventions men have to get this wealth. They search out all perfection_ v,20250223
What is intended for our good challenges our regard. If Job will observe what is said_ ,20250223
What is lighter than the wind? Yet God hath ways of poising it. He knows how to make the weight for the winds_ which he brings out of his treasuries (Ps. cxxxv. keeping a very particular account of what he draws out_ as men do of what they pay out of their treasuries_ not at random_ as men bring out their trash.,20250223
What is not liked is commonly thought long; but Job had more reason to think those long who assaulted him than they had to think him long who only vindicated himself. Better cause may be shown for defending ourselves_ if we have right on our side_ than for offending our brethren_ though we have right on our side. Now observe here_,20250223
What is often done by the providence of God: The righteous is delivered out of trouble_ and the wicked comes in his stead_ and so seems as if he were a ransom for him_ ch. xi,20250223
What is required of those that may have the benefit of this invitation_ v,20250223
What is the business of magistrates. They are to be a terror to evil-doers. They must scatter the wicked_ who are linked in confederacies to assist and embolden one another in doing mischief; and there is no doing this but by bringing the wheel over them_ that is_ putting the laws in execution against them_ crushing their power and quashing their projects. Severity must sometimes be used to rid the country of those that are openly vicious and mischievous_ debauched and debauching,20250223
What is the care and aim of a good man: His root yields fruit_ and is his strength and stability_ and that is it that he desires_ to do good and to be fixed and confirmed in doing good. The wicked desires only a net wherewith to fish for himself; the righteous desires to yield fruit for the benefit of others and God's glory_ Rom. xiv. 6.,20250223
What is the care and aim of a wicked man; he would do mischief: He desires the net of evil men. __Oh that I were but as cunning as such a man_ to make a hand of those I deal with_ that I had but his art of over-reaching_ that I could but take my revenge on one I have spite to as effectually as he can!__ He desires the strong-hold_ or fortress_ of evil men (so some read it)_ to act securely in doing mischief_ that it may not turn upon him,20250223
What is the common course men take to advance and enrich themselves_ and make themselves great: they seek the ruler's favour_ and_ as if all their judgment proceeded from him_ to him they make all their court. Solomon was himself a ruler_ and knew with what sedulity men made their application to him_ some on one errand_ others on another_ but all for his favour. It is the way of the world to make interest with great men_ and expect much from the smiles of second causes_ which yet are uncertain_ and frequently disappoint them. Many take a great deal of pains in seeking the ruler's favour and yet cannot have it; many have it for a little while_ but they cannot keep themselves in it_ by some little turn or other they are brought under his displeasure; many have it_ and keep it_ and yet it does not answer their expectation_ they cannot make that hand of it that they promised themselves they should. Haman had the ruler's favour_ and yet it availed him nothing,20250223
What is the common fate of those that fall into adversity. Poverty serves to eclipse all their lustre; though they are lamps_ yet_ if taken out of golden candlesticks_ and put_ like Gideon's_ into earthen pitchers_ nobody values them as formerly_ but those that live at ease despise them.,20250223
What is the common fault of those that live in prosperity. Being full_ and easy_ and merry themselves_ they look scornfully upon those that are in want_ pain_ and sorrow; they overlook them_ take no notice of them_ and study to forget them. See Ps. cxxiii,20250223
What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God? Seared consciences will feel it hereafter_ but do not fear it now. Enlightened consciences fear it now_ but shall not feel it hereafter. Job's present apprehension was that God counted him as one of his enemies; and yet_ at the same time_ God loved him_ and gloried in him_ as his faithful friend. It is a gross mistake_ but a very common one_ to think that whom God afflicts he treats as his enemies; whereas_ on the contrary_ as many as he loves he rebukes and chastens; it is the discipline of his sons. Which way soever Job looked he thought he saw the tokens of God's displeasure against him. 1. Did he look back upon his former prosperity? He saw God's hand putting an end to that (v. 9): __He has stripped me of my glory_ my wealth_ honour_ power_ and all the opportunity I had of doing good. My children were my glory_ but I have lost them; and whatever was a crown to my head he has taken it from me_ and has laid all my honour in the dust.__ See the vanity of worldly glory: it is what we may be soon stripped of; and_ whatever strips us_ we must see and own God's hand in it and comply with his design,20250223
What is the qualification of magistrates_ which is necessary in order to do this. They have need to be both pious and prudent_ for it is the wise king_ who is both religious and discreet_ that is likely to effect the suppression of vice and reformation of manners.,20250223
What is the true way to true happiness_ the certain means to attain our great end? He had in vain sought it among those things which most men are eager in pursuit of_ but here_ at length_ he has found it_ by the help of that discovery which God anciently made to man (Job xxviii. that serious godliness is the only way to true happiness: Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter_ the return entered upon the writ of enquiry_ the result of this diligent search; you shall have all I have been driving at in two words. He does not say_ Do you hear it_ but Let us hear it; for preachers must themselves be hearers of that word which they preach to others_ must hear it as from God; those are teachers by the halves who teach others and not themselves_ Rom. ii Every word of God is pure and precious_ but some words are worthy of more special remark_ as this; the Masorites begin it with a capital letter_ as that Deut. vi,20250223
What is the wisdom of ancient men compared with the wisdom of the ancient of days! It is but little that we know_ and less that we can do; but God can do every thing_ and no thought can be withheld from him. Happy are those who have this God for their God_ for they have infinite wisdom and strength engaged for them. Foolish and fruitless are all the attempts of men against him (v. 14): He breaketh down_ and it cannot be built again. Note_ There is no contending with the divine providence_ nor breaking the measures of it. As he had said before (ch. ix.,20250223
What is the wisest course men can take to be happy. Let them look up to God_ and seek the favour of the Ruler of rulers; for every man's judgment proceeds from the Lord. It is not with us as the ruler pleases; his favour cannot make us happy_ his frowns cannot make us miserable. But it is as God pleases; every creature is that to us that God makes it to be_ no more and no other. He is the first Cause_ on which all second causes depend; if he help not_ they cannot_ 2 Kings vi. 27; Job,20250223
What is thy beloved more than another beloved? wondering that the spouse should be so passionately in love with him_ are now of another mind_ and are themselves in love with him; for,20250223
What is to be done with the scorner that will not be reclaimed: Cast him out of your society_ as Ishmael_ when he mocked Isaac_ was thrust out of Abraham's family. Those that would secure the peace must exclude the scorner.,20250223
What is to be gotten by it—riches_ and honour_ and comfort_ and long life_ in this world_ as far as God sees good_ at least spiritual riches and honour in the favour of God_ and the promises and privileges of the covenant of grace_ and eternal life at last.,20250223
What is urged to recommend it to us. ,20250223
What it is that is here recommended to us_ not to indulge the appetites of the flesh_ or to take up with present pleasures or profits for our portion_ but soberly and moderately to make use of what Providence has allotted for our comfortable passage through this world. We must not starve ourselves through covetousness_ because we cannot afford ourselves food convenient_ nor through eagerness in our worldly pursuits_ nor through excessive care and grief_ but eat and drink what is fit for us to keep our bodies in good plight for the serving of our souls in God's service. We must not kill ourselves with labour_ and then leave others to enjoy the good of it_ but take the comfort of that which our hands have laboured for_ and that not now and then_ but all the days of our life which God gives us. Life is God's gift_ and he has appointed us the number of the days of our life (Job xiv. 5); let us therefore spend those days in serving the Lord our God with joyfulness and gladness of heart. We must not do the business of our calling as a drudgery_ and make ourselves slaves to it_ but we must rejoice in our labour_ not grasp at more business than we can go through without perplexity and disquiet_ but take a pleasure in the calling wherein God has put us_ and go on in the business of it with cheerfulness. This it to rejoice in our labour_ whatever it is_ as Zebulun in his going out and Issachar in his tents,20250223
What it is that is provided for them. ,20250223
What it is that keeps a fool from being wise: His way is right in his own eyes; he thinks he is in the right in every thing he does_ and therefore asks no advice_ because he does not apprehend he needs it; he is confident he knows the way_ and cannot miss it_ and therefore never enquires the way. The rule he goes by is to do that which is right in his own eyes_ to walk in the way of his heart. Quicquid libet_ licet—He makes his will his law. He is a fool that is governed by his eye_ and not by his conscience,20250223
What it is that keeps a wise man from being a fool; he is willing to be advised_ desires to have counsel given him_ and hearkens to counsel_ being diffident of his own judgment and having a value for the direction of those that are wise and good. He is wise (it is a sign he is so_ and he is likely to continue so) whose ear is always open to good advice.,20250223
What it is that thus affects him with delight.,20250223
What it is to make religion our business; it is to follow after righteousness and mercy_ not to content ourselves with easy performances_ but to do our duty with the utmost care and pains_ as those that are pressing forward and in fear of coming short. We must both do justly and love mercy_ and must proceed and persevere therein; and_ though we cannot attain to perfection_ yet it will be a comfort to us if we aim at it and follow after it,20250223
What little account Job made of the discouragements he met with in the way of his duty. He valued not the clamours of the mob_ feared not a great multitude_ nor did he value the menaces of the mighty: The contempt of families never terrified him. He was not deterred by the number or quality_ the scorns or insults_ or the injurious from doing justice to the injured; no_ he scorned to be swayed and biassed by any such considerations_ nor ever suffered a righteous cause to be run down by a high hand. He feared the great God_ not the multitude_ and his curse_ not the contempt of families.,20250223
What little comfort wise and useful men must expect to have in this world. Let them behave themselves ever so cautiously_ they cannot escape being envied; and who can stand before envy? Prov. xxvii,20250223
What little conscience most men have_ that they will bear a grudge to a neighbour_ give him an ill word and do him an ill turn_ only because he is more ingenious and industrious than themselves_ and has more of the blessing of heaven. Cain envied Abel_ Esau Jacob_ and Saul David_ and all for their right works. This is downright diabolism,20250223
What many a man is forced to do under such an affliction. He cannot keep up his authority. He finds it to no purpose to contradict the most unreasonable passion_ for it is unruly and rages so much the more; and his wisdom and grace will not suffer him to render railing for railing_ nor his conjugal affection to use any severity_ and therefore he finds it his best way to retire into a corner of the house-top_ and sit alone there_ out of the hearing of her clamour; and if he employ himself well there_ as he may do_ it is the wisest course he can take. Better do so than quit the house_ and go into bad company_ for diversion_ as many_ who_ like Adam_ make their wife's sin the excuse of their own.,20250223
What notice the devil took of it_ and how he improved it against him. The devil speaks of it with vexation. __I see thou hast made a hedge about him_ round about;__ as if he had walked it round_ to see if he could spy a single gap in it_ for him to enter in at_ to do him a mischief; but he was disappointed: it was a complete hedge. The wicked one saw it and was grieved_ and argued against Job that the only reason why he served God was because God prospered him. __No thanks to him to be true to the government that prefers him_ and to serve a Master that pays him so well.__,20250223
What ought to be the care of a servant_ the meanest that is sent on an errand and entrusted with any business_ much more the greatest_ the agent and ambassador of a prince; he ought to be faithful to him that sends him_ and to see to it that he do not_ by mistake or with design_ falsify his trust_ and that he be in nothing that lies in his power wanting to his master's interest. Those that act as factors_ by commission_ ought to act as carefully as for themselves,20250223
What ought to quiet us under our troubles—that it is to no purpose to contend with Omnipotence. ,20250223
What pains he takes for it: It is that which he laboured for (v. not by honest diligence in a lawful calling_ but by an unwearied prosecution of all ways and methods_ per fas_ per nefas—right or wrong_ to be rich. We must labour_ not to be rich (Prov. xxiii. but to be charitable_ that we may have to give (Eph. iv. not to spend. ,20250223
What pains men take to do mischief to others. As they put a force upon themselves by concealing their design with a profession of friendship_ so they put themselves to a great deal of labour to bring it about; it is digging a pit_ it is rolling a stone_ hard work_ and yet men will not stick at it to gratify their passion and revenge,20250223
What pains men take_ and what vast charge they are at_ to get this wealth. They work their way through the rocks and undermine the mountains_ v. 10,20250223
What pleasure God takes in the work of his own hands. When we are made as a wall_ as a brazen wall (Jer. i. 18; xv. that stands firmly against the blast of the terrible ones (Isa. xxv. then God takes delight in us to do us good. ,20250223
What preparation they hereby make of mischief to themselves. Their violent dealing will return upon their own heads; they shall themselves fall into the pit they digged_ and the stone they rolled will return upon them_ Ps. vii. 15_ 16; ix. 15_ 16. The righteous God will take the wise_ not only in their own craftiness_ but in their own cruelty. It is the plotter's doom. Haman is hanged on a gallows of his own preparing.,20250223
What pride and pleasure men take in a good bargain when they have got it_ though therein they contradict themselves_ and own they dissembled when they were driving the bargain. When the buyer has beaten down the seller_ who was content to lower his price rather than lose a customer (as many poor tradesmen are forced to do—small profit is better than none)_ then he goes his way_ and boasts what excellent goods he has got at his own price_ and takes it as an affront and a reflection upon his judgment if any body disparages his bargain. Perhaps he knew the worth of the good better than the seller himself did and knows how to get a great deal by them. See how apt men are to be pleased with their gettings and proud of their tricks; whereas a fraud and a lie are what a man ought to be ashamed of_ though he have gained ever so much by them.,20250223
What regard we are to have to the voice of the people. We are not to think it an indifferent thing_ and not worth heeding_ whether we have the ill will and word_ or the good will and word_ of our neighbours_ their prayers or their curses; for here we are taught to dread their curses_ and forego our own profit rather than incur them; and to court their blessings_ and be at some expense to purchase them. Sometimes_ vox populi est vox Dei—the voice of the people is the voice of God.,20250223
What shall we do for them? We can but pity them_ and pray for them. Lord_ what wilt thou do for them? The saints_ in Solomon's time_ might know_ from David's psalms_ that God had mercy in store for them_ and they begged it might be hastened to them. Now the tables are turned; the Gentiles are betrothed to Christ_ and ought to return the kindness by an equal concern for the bringing in of the Jews again_ our eldest sister_ that once had breasts_ but now has none. If we take it in this sense_ the unbelieving posterity of these pious Jews contradicted this prayer of their fathers; for_ when the day came that the Gentiles should be spoken for and courted to Christ_ instead of considering what to do for them they plotted to do all they could against them_ which filled up the measure of their iniquity_ 1 Thess. ii,20250223
What she values herself upon_ her having found favour in the eyes of Jesus Christ. Those are happy_ truly happy_ and for ever so_ that have the favour of God and are accepted of him. ,20250223
What should be done by the justice of men: The wicked_ that are the troublers of a land_ ought to be punished_ for the preventing and turning away of those national judgments which otherwise will be inflicted and in which even the righteous are many times involved. Thus when Achan was stoned he was a ransom for the camp of righteous Israel; and the seven sons of Saul_ when they were hanged_ were a ransom for the kingdom of righteous David,20250223
What sin is_ and what reason we have not to sin. Would we know the nature of sin and the malignity of it? It is the perverting of that which is right; it is a most unjust unreasonable thing; it is the rebellion of the creature against the Creator_ the usurped dominion of the flesh over the spirit_ and a contradiction to the eternal rules and reasons of good and evil. It is perverting the right ways of the Lord (Acts xiii. and therefore the ways of sin are called crooked ways_ Ps. cxxv,20250223
What success we may hope for in the use of these means. Our labour shall not be in vain; for,20250223
What that wealth is which is indeed desirable_ not having abundance only_ but having it and no sorrow with it_ no disquieting care to get and keep it_ no vexation of spirit in the enjoyment of it_ no tormenting grief for the loss of it_ no guilt contracted by the abuse of it—to have it and to have a heart to take the comfort of it_ to do good with it and to serve God with joyfulness and gladness of heart in the use of it,20250223
What the advantage will be of their doing this duty. ,20250223
What the call of God and Christ is.,20250223
What the duty of magistrates is: To take away the wicked_ to use their power for the terror of evil works and evil workers_ not only to banish those that are vicious and profane from their presence_ and forbid them the court_ but so to frighten them and restrain them that they may not spread the infection of their wickedness among their subjects. This is called taking away the dross from the silver_ which is done by the force of fire. Wicked people are the dross of a nation_ the scum of the country_ and_ as such_ to be taken away. If men will not take them away_ God will_ Ps. cxix. 119. If the wicked be taken away from before the king_ if he abandon them and show his detestation of their wicked courses_ it will go far towards the disabling of them to do mischief. The reformation of the court will promote the reformation of the kingdom_ Ps. ci. 3_ 8,20250223
What the happiness of those is who do find it.,20250223
What the invitation is. We are invited to Wisdom's house: Turn in hither. I say we are_ for which of us is there that must not own the character of the invited_ that are simple and want understanding? Wisdom's doors stand open to such_ and she is desirous to have some conversation with them_ one word for their good_ nor has she any other design upon them. ,20250223
What the pretension is that is excluded. We cannot say_ We have made our hearts clean. Though we can say_ through grace_ __We are cleaner than we have been___ yet we cannot say_ __We are clean and pure from all remainders of sin.__ Or_ though we are clean from the gross acts of sin_ yet we cannot say_ __Our hearts are clean.__ Or_ though we are washed and cleansed_ yet we cannot say_ __We ourselves made our own hearts clean;__ it was the work of the Spirit. Or_ though we are pure from the sins of many others_ yet we cannot say_ __We are pure from our sin_ the sin that easily besets us_ the body of death which Paul complained of___ Rom. vii. 24.,20250223
What the scorner does. It is implied that he sows discord and makes mischief wherever he comes. Much of the strife and contention which disturb the peace of all societies is owing to the evil interpreter (as some read it)_ that construes every thing into the worst_ to those that despise and deride every one that comes in their way and take a pride in bantering and abusing all mankind,20250223
What the slothful man really dreads. He dreads the way_ the streets_ the place where work is to be done and a journey to be gone; he hates business_ hates every thing that requires care and labour,20250223
What the temptation is (v. 17): Stolen waters are sweet. It is to water and bread_ whereas Wisdom invites to the beasts she has killed and the wine she has mingled; however_ bread and water are acceptable enough to those that are hungry and thirsty; and this is pretended to be more sweet and pleasant than common_ for it is stolen water and bread eaten in secret_ with a fear of being discovered. The pleasures of prohibited lusts are boasted of as more relishing than those of prescribed love; and dishonest gain is preferred to that which is justly gotten. Now this argues_ not only a bold contempt_ but an impudent defiance,20250223
What their real character is; they are passengers that go right on their ways (v. that have been trained up in the paths of religion and virtue and set out very hopefully and well_ that seemed determined and designed for good_ and are not (as that young man_ ch. vii. 8) going the way to her house. Such as these she has a design upon_ and lays snares for_ and uses all her arts_ all her charms_ to pervert them; if they go right on_ and will not look towards her_ she will call after them_ so urgent are these temptations. ,20250223
What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth_ what shall I answer him? 15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?,20250223
What they are supposed to do in that distress: They cry_ for they are noisy clamorous creatures_ and this is interpreted as crying to God. It being the cry of nature_ it is looked upon as directed to the God of nature. The putting of so favourable a construction as this upon the cries of the young ravens may encourage us in our prayers_ though we can but cry_ Abba_ Father. ,20250223
What they do to heap up wrath. What is it that is so provoking? It is this_ They cry not when he binds them_ that is_ when they are in affliction_ bound with the cords of trouble_ their hearts are hardened_ they are stubborn and unhumbled_ and will not cry to God nor make their application to him. They are stupid and senseless as stocks and stones_ despising the chastening of the Lord,20250223
What use we are to make of the gifts of God's bounty; we must not hoard them up merely for our own advantage_ that we may be enriched by them_ but we must bring them forth for the benefit of others_ that they may be supported and maintained by them. It is a sin_ when corn is dear and scarce_ to withhold it_ in hopes that it will still grow dearer_ so to keep up and advance the market_ when it is already so high that the poor suffer by it; and at such a time it is the duty of those that have stocks of corn by them to consider the poor_ and to be willing to sell at the market-price_ to be content with moderate profit_ and not aim to make a gain of God's judgments. It is a noble and extensive piece of charity for those that have stores wherewithal to do it to help to keep the markets low when the price of our commodities grows excessive,20250223
What was all he expected_ nothing but what would be for his own good_ that his heart be wise and that his lips speak right things_ that he be under the government of good principles_ and that by those principles he particularly maintain a good environment of his tongue. It is to be hoped that those will do right things when they grow up who learn to speak right things when they are young_ and dare not speak any bad words. ,20250223
What was hidden under ground is laid upon the bank; the metal that was hidden in the ore is refined from its dross and brought forth pure out of the furnace; and then he thinks his pains well bestowed. Go to the miners then_ thou sluggard in religion; consider their ways_ and be wise. Let their courage_ diligence_ and constancy in seeking the wealth that perisheth shame us out of slothfulness and faint-heartedness in labouring for the true riches. How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! How much easier and safer! Yet gold is sought for_ but grace neglected. Will the hopes of precious things out of the earth (so they call them_ though really they are paltry and perishing) be such a spur to industry_ and shall not the certain prospect of truly precious things in heaven be much more so?,20250223
What was luscious in the mouth rises in the stomach and turns sour there; it cuts_ in the reflection_ like a two-edged sword; take it which way you will_ it wounds. Solomon could speak by experience_ Eccl. vii,20250223
What we do we should be able to render a reason for_ though perhaps we may not have wit enough to show the fallacy of every objection against it. He that takes pains in religion can render a good reason for it; he knows that he is working for a good Master and that his labour shall not be in vain. But the sluggard thinks himself wiser than seven such; for let seven such persuade him to be diligent_ with all the reasons they can render for it_ it is to no purpose; his own determination_ he thinks_ answer enough to them and all their reasons,20250223
What we gave we have.,20250223
What we know of God is nothing to what we cannot know. What is hidden is more than double to what appears_ Eph. iii,20250223
What we must do that we may contract and cultivate friendship; we must show ourselves friendly. Would we have friends and keep them_ we must not only not affront them_ or quarrel with them_ but we must love them_ and make it appear that we do so by all expressions that are endearing_ by being free with them_ pleasing to them_ visiting them and bidding them welcome_ and especially by doing all the good offices we can and serving them in every thing that lies in our power; that is showing ourselves friendly.,20250223
What we must not meddle with we must not lust after; and what we must not lust after we must not look at; not the forbidden wealth (Prov. xxiii. not the forbidden wine (Prov. xxiii. not the forbidden woman_ Matt. v,20250223
What we utter before God must come from the heart_ and therefore we must not be rash with our mouth_ never let our tongue outrun our thoughts in our devotions; the words of our mouth_ must always be the product of the meditation of our hearts. Thoughts are words to God_ and words are but wind if they be not copied from the thoughts. Lip-labour_ though ever so well laboured_ if that be all_ is but lost labour in religion_ Matt. xv. 8_ 9. ,20250223
What were Job's condescensions to his servants (v. 13): He did not despise the cause of his man-servant_ no_ nor of his maid-servant_ when they contended with him. If they contradicted him in any thing_ he was willing to hear their reasons. If they had offended him_ or were accused to him_ he would patiently hear what they had to say for themselves_ in their own vindication or excuse. Nay_ if they complained of any hardship he put upon them_ he did not browbeat them_ and bid them hold their tongues_ but gave them leave to tell their story_ and redressed their grievances as far as it appeared they had right on their side. He was tender of them_ not only when they served and pleased him_ but even when they contended with him. Herein he was a great example to masters_ to give to their servants that which is just and equal; nay_ to do the same things to them that they expect from them (Col. iv. 1_ Eph. vi. and not to rule them with rigour_ and carry it with a high hand. Many of Job's servants were slain in his service (ch. i. 15-17); the rest were unkind and undutiful to him_ and despised his cause_ though he never despised theirs (ch. xix. 15_ 16); but he had this comfort that in his prosperity he had behaved well towards them. Note_ When relations are either removed from us or embittered to us the testimony of our consciences that we have done our duty to them will be a great support and comfort to us.,20250223
What will abundantly comfort us—if we are able to appeal to God_ as Job here_ __Lord_ thou knowest that I am not wicked. I cannot say that l am not wanting_ or I am not weak; but_ through grace_ I can say_ I am not wicked: thou knowest I am not_ for thou knowest I love thee.__,20250223
What will be the advantage of doing so: Those that do follow after righteousness shall find righteousness; God will give them grace to do good_ and they shall have the pleasure and comfort of doing it; those that make conscience of being just to others shall have the pleasure and comfort of doing it; those that make conscience of being just to others shall be justly dealt with by others and others shall be kind to them. The Jews followed after righteousness_ and did not find it_ because they sought amiss_ Rom. ix,20250223
What will be the credit and comfort of a poor man_ and make him more excellent than his neighbour_ though his poverty may expose him to contempt and may dispirit him. Let him be honest and walk in integrity_ let him keep a good conscience and make it appear that he does so_ let him always speak and act with sincerity when he is under the greatest temptations to dissemble and break his word_ and then let him value himself upon that_ for all wise and good men will value him. He is better_ has a better character_ is in a better condition_ is better beloved_ and lives to better purpose_ than many a one that looks great and makes a figure,20250223
What will be the shame of a rich man_ notwithstanding all his pomp. If he have a shallow head and an evil tongue_ if he is perverse in his lips and is a fool_ if he is a wicked man and gets what he has by fraud and oppression_ he is a fool_ and an honest poor man is to be preferred far before him.,20250223
What will his hope be then? It will be vanity and a lie; it will stand him in no stead. The wealth of this world_ which he hoped in_ he must leave behind him_ Ps. xlix,20250223
What you know_ the same do I know also; and now they return upon him_ according to the usage of eager disputants_ who think they have a privilege to commend themselves: What knowest thou that we know not? How natural are such replies as these in the heat of argument! But how simple do they look afterwards_ upon the review! ,20250223
Whatever other evils may be avoided_ we are all under a fatal necessity of dying_,20250223
Whatever punishment is inflicted upon us in this world we must own that it is less than our iniquities deserve_ and therefore_ instead of complaining of our troubles_ we must be thankful that we are out of hell_ Lam. iii. 39; Ps. ciii. 10.,20250223
Whatever qualifications for government any kings or princes have they are indebted to the grace of Christ for them; he gives them the spirit of government_ and they have nothing_ no skill_ no principles of justice_ but what he endues them with. A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; and kings are to their subjects what he makes them,20250223
Whatever strength this_ or any other creature_ has_ it is derived from God_ who therefore must be acknowledged to have all power originally and infinitely in himself_ and such an arm as it is not for us to contest with. This beast is here called the chief_ in its kind_ of the ways of God (v. an eminent instance of the Creator's power and wisdom. Those that will peruse the accounts given by historians of the elephant will find that his capacities approach nearer to those of reason than the capacities of any other brute-creature whatsoever_ and therefore he is fitly called the chief of the ways of God_ in the inferior part of the creation_ no creature below man being preferable to him,20250223
Whatever temptation he might be in from the excellency of the wine_ or the charms of the company_ he must deny himself_ and be strictly sober_ considering_ ,20250223
Whatever we attain to in this world_ still we are but men_ and the greatest possessions and preferments cannot set us above the common accidents of human life: That which has been_ and is_ that busy animal that makes such a stir and such a noise in the world_ is named already. He that made him gave him his name_ and it is known that it is man; that is his name by which he must know himself_ and it is a humbling name_ Gen. v,20250223
Whatsoever thy hand finds to do do it with thy might. Observe here_ ,20250223
When Balaam saw Israel encamped according to their tribes_ by their standards_ with colours displayed_ he said_ How goodly are thy tents_ O Jacob! Num.,20250223
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men_ then his wrath was kindled.,20250223
When God appeared for him: After the Lord had spoken these words unto Job_ v,20250223
When God buries him men shall hiss him out of his place_ and leave on his name perpetual marks of infamy. In the same place where he has been caressed and cried up he shall be laughed at (Ps. lii. 7) and his ashes shall be trampled on.,20250223
When God designs men's good by the convictions and dictates of their own consciences,20250223
When I washed my steps with butter_ and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;,20250223
When Nathan would convict David of the evil of his adultery he did it by a parable concerning the most aggravated theft_ which_ in David's judgment_ deserved to be punished with death (2 Sam. xii. and then showed him that his sin was more exceedingly sinful than that. First_ It is a greater reproach to a man's reason_ for he cannot excuse it_ as a thief may_ by saying that it was to satisfy his hunger_ but must own that it was to gratify a brutish lust which would break the hedge of God's law_ not for want_ but for wantonness. Therefore whoso commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding_ and deserves to be stigmatized as an arrant fool. Secondly_ It is more severely punished by the law of God. A thief suffered only a pecuniary mulct_ but the adulterer suffered death. The thief steals to satisfy his soul_ but the adulterer destroys his own soul_ and falls an unpitied sacrifice to the justice both of God and man. __Sinner_ thou hast destroyed thyself.__ This may be applied to the spiritual and eternal death which is the consequence of sin; he that does it wounds his conscience_ corrupts his rational power_ extinguishes all the sparks of the spiritual life_ and exposes himself to the wrath of God for ever_ and thus destroys his own soul. Thirdly_ The infamy of it is indelible_ v,20250223
When Peter was a Satan to Christ he told him plainly_ Thou art an offence to me. ,20250223
When Solomon was grown up he not only remembered_ but took a pleasure in repeating_ the good lessons his parents taught him when he was a child. He did not forget them_ so deep were the impressions they made upon him. He was not ashamed of them_ such a high value had he for them_ nor did he look upon them as the childish things_ the mean things_ which_ when he became a man_ a king_ he should put away_ as a disparagement to him; much less did he repeat them: as some wicked children have done_ to ridicule them_ and make his companions merry with them_ priding himself that he had got clear from grave lessons and restraints. ,20250223
When a man talks foolishly we say_ He talks idly; for none betray their folly more than those who are idle and go about to excuse themselves in their idleness. As men's folly makes them slothful_ so their slothfulness makes them foolish. Observe,20250223
When a poor soul is parched with convictions of sin and the terrors of the law_ as David (Ps. xxxii. when fatigued with the troubles of this world_ as Elijah when he sat down under a juniper tree (1 Kings xix. they find that in Christ_ in his name_ his graces_ his comforts_ and his undertaking for poor sinners_ which revives them and keeps them from fainting; those that are weary and heavily laden may find rest in Christ. It is not enough to pass by this shadow_ but we must sit down under it (here will I dwell_ for I have desired it); and we shall find it not like Jonah's gourd_ that soon withered_ and left him in a heat_ both inward and outward_ but like the tree of life_ the leaves whereof were not only for shelter_ but for the healing of the nations. We must sit down under this shadow with delight_ must put an entire confidence in the protection of it (as Judges ix. and take an entire complacency in the refreshment of it. But that is not all: 2. Here is pleasing nourishing food. This tree drops its fruits to those that sit down under its shadow_ and they are welcome to them_ and will find them sweet unto their taste_ whatever they are to others. Believers have tasted that the Lord Jesus is gracious (1 Pet. ii. 3); his fruits are all the precious privileges of the new covenant_ purchased by his blood and communicated by his Spirit. Promises are sweet to a believer_ yea_ and precepts too. I delight in the law of God after the inward man. Pardons are sweet_ and peace of conscience is sweet_ assurances of God's love_ joys of the Holy Ghost_ the hopes of eternal life_ and the present earnests and foretastes of it are sweet_ all sweet to those that have their spiritual senses exercised. If our mouths be put out of taste for the pleasure of sin_ divine consolations will be sweet to our taste_ sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.,20250223
When any private persons plead for sin and sinners_ palliate and excuse wickedness_ or argue against virtue and piety_ and so pervert the right ways of the Lord and confound the eternal distinctions between good and evil.,20250223
When believers accept of him as theirs_ and join themselves to him in an everlasting covenant_ ,20250223
When even wise men have unreasonable hardships put upon them they have much ado to keep their temper and to keep their place. It destroys the heart of a gift (so the latter clause may be read); even the generous heart that is ready to give gifts_ and a gracious heart that is endowed with many excellent gifts_ is destroyed by being oppressed. We should therefore make great allowances to those that are abused and ill-dealt with_ and not be severe in our censures of them_ though they do not act so discreetly as they should; we know not what we should do if it were our own case.,20250223
When found out it is hard to be fetched out. Men's wits must be set on work to contrive ways and means to get this hidden treasure into their hands. They must with their lamps set an end to darkness; and if one expedient miscarry_ one method fail_ they must try another_ till they have searched out all perfection_ and turned every stone to effect it_ v,20250223
When he despised the goodness of God to him in giving him a being (such a being_ so noble and excellent a life_ such a life_ so far above that of any other creature in this lower world)_ and undervalued the gift_ as not worth the acceptance_ only because transit cum onere—it was clogged with a proviso of trouble_ which now at length came upon him_ after many years' enjoyment of its pleasures. What a foolish thing it was to wish that his eyes had never seen the light_ that so they might not have seen sorrow_ which yet he might hope to see through_ and beyond which he might see joy! Did Job believe and hope that he should in his flesh see God at the latter day (ch. xix. and yet would he wish he had never had a being capable of such a bliss_ only because_ for the present_ he had sorrow in the flesh? God by his grace arm us against this foolish and hurtful lust of impatience.,20250223
When he did that he laid all the measures of his providence_ and drew an exact scheme of the whole work from first to last. Then_ from eternity_ did he see in himself_ and declare to himself_ the plan of his proceedings. Then he prepared it_ fixed it_ and established it_ set every thing in readiness for all his works_ so that_ when any thing was to be done_ nothing was to seek_ nor could any thing unforeseen occur_ to put it either out of its method or out of its time; for all was ordered as exactly as if he had studied it and searched it out_ so that_ whatever he does_ nothing can be put to it nor taken from it_ and therefore it shall be for ever_ Eccl. iii,20250223
When he pleases he alters the course of nature_ and turns back its streams_ v. 5-7. By the common law of nature the mountains are settled and are therefore called everlasting mountains_ the earth is established and cannot be removed (Ps. xciii. 1) and the pillars there of are immovably fixed_ the sun rises in its season_ and the stars shed their influences on this lower world; but when God pleases he can not only drive out of the common track_ but invert the order and change the law of nature. ,20250223
When he sees that the sick person is indeed convinced that sincere repentance_ and that uprightness which is gospel perfection_ are his interest as well as his duty_ then he that waits to be gracious_ and shows mercy upon the first indication of true repentance_ is gracious unto him_ and takes him into his favour and thoughts for good. Wherever God finds a gracious heart he will be found a gracious God; and,20250223
When he spoke—Then. When they had all had their saying_ and yet had not gained their point_ then it was time for God to interpose_ whose judgment is according to truth. When we know not who is in the right_ and perhaps are doubtful whether we ourselves are_ this may satisfy us_ That God will determine shortly in the valley of decision_ Joel iii,20250223
When he stirred up conscience_ that ordinary deputy of his_ in the soul_ to do its office_ he took that opportunity_ either when deep sleep fell on men (for_ though dreams mostly come from fancy_ some may come from conscience) or in slumberings_ when men are between sleeping and waking_ reflecting at night upon the business of the foregoing day or projecting in the morning the business of the ensuing day; then is a proper time for their hearts to reproach them for what they have done ill and to admonish them what they should do. See Isa. xxx. 21.,20250223
When he took so much pains to express his desire that he had never been born_ which_ at the best was a vain wish_ for it is impossible to make that which has been not to have been. ,20250223
When he was so liberal of his curses upon a day and a night that could not be hurt_ or made any the worse for his curses. ,20250223
When he was tempted to be harsh with his servants_ to deny them their right and turn a deaf ear to their reasonings_ this thought came very seasonably into his mind_ __Did not he that made me in the womb make him? I am a creature as well as he_ and my being is derived and depending as well as his. He partakes of the same nature that I do and is the work of the same hand: Have we not all one Father?__ Note_ Whatever difference there is among men in their outward condition_ in their capacity of mind_ or strength of body_ or place in the world_ he that made the one made the other also_ which is a good reason why we should not mock at men's natural infirmities_ nor trample upon those that are in any way our inferiors_ but_ in every thing_ do as we would be done by. It is a rule of justice_ Parium par sit ratio—Let equals be equally estimated and treated; and therefore since there is so great a parity among men_ they being all made of the same mould_ by the same power_ for the same end_ notwithstanding the disparity of our outward condition_ we are bound so far to set ourselves upon the level with those we deal with as to do to them_ in all respects_ as we would they should do to us.,20250223
When he wished a thing so very barbarous to his own mother as that she had not brought him forth when her full time had come_ which must inevitably have been her death_ and a miserable death. ,20250223
When his candle shined upon my head_ and when by his light I walked through darkness,20250223
When it comes to our turn we shall find the grave ready for us_ Job xvii. 1,20250223
When it has dominion over us. When it not only fills the head with notions_ but enters into the heart and has a commanding power and influence upon that_—when it is upon the throne there_ and gives law to the affections and passions_—when it enters into the heart as the leaven into the dough_ to diffuse its relish there_ and to change it into its own image—then it is likely to do us good. ,20250223
When it is perfected in the kingdom of glory then it will be clear as the sun_ the church clothed with the sun_ with Christ the sun of righteousness_ Rev. xii. 1. Those that love God will then be as the sun when he goes forth in his strength (Judges v. 31; Matt. xiii. 43); they shall shine in inexpressible glory_ and that which is perfect will then come; there shall be no darkness_ no spots_ Isa. xxx. 26.,20250223
When life is gone all this world is gone with it_ as to us. ,20250223
When men are drunk they know not where they are nor what they say and do. ,20250223
When others could not be heard all men gave ear to him_ and kept silence at his counsel_ knowing that_ as nothing could be said against it_ so nothing needed to be added to it. And therefore_ after his words_ they spoke not again_ v,20250223
When she was disabled by the abuses the watchmen gave her to prosecute her enquiry herself she gave charge to those about her to assist her in the enquiry (v. 8): I charge you_ O you daughters of Jerusalem! all my friends and acquaintance_ if you find my beloved_ it may be you may meet with him before I shall_ what shall you tell him? so some read. __Speak a good word for me; tell him that I am sick of love.__ Observe here_ ,20250223
When solemn appeals are made to Providence by the casting of lots_ for the deciding of that matter of moment which could not otherwise be at all_ or not so well_ decided_ God must be eyed in it_ by prayer_ that it may be disposed aright (Give a perfect lot_ 1 Sam. xiv.,20250223
When the Almighty was yet with me_ when my children were about me,20250223
When the Creator had made his great works he reviewed them_ and behold_ all was very good; every thing pleased him. But when Solomon reviewed all his works that his hands had wrought with the utmost cost and care_ and the labour that he had laboured to do in order to make himself easy and happy_ nothing answered his expectation; behold_ all was vanity and vexation of spirit; he had no satisfaction in it_ no advantage by it; there was no profit under the sun_ neither by the employments nor by the enjoyments of this world.,20250223
When the church preserves her purity she secures her honour and victory; when she is fair as the moon_ and clear as the sun_ she is truly great and formidable.,20250223
When the debt of duty is not paid it is justice to insist upon the debt of punishment.,20250223
When the heart is humbled and weaned_ by humbling weaning providence_ then we receive correction (Zeph. iii. 2) and take up our cross.,20250223
When the mercy of God pardons the transgression that is committed by us the grace of God takes away the iniquity that reigns in us. Wherever God removes the guilt of sin he breaks the power of sin. ,20250223
When the morning stars sang together_ and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 8 Or who shut up the sea with doors_ when it brake forth_ as if it had issued out of the womb? 9 When I made the cloud the garment thereof_ and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it_ 10 And brake up for it my decreed place_ and set bars and doors_ 11 And said_ Hitherto shalt thou come_ but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?,20250223
When the prodigal repented_ it is said_ He came to himself (Luke xv. which intimates that he had been beside himself before,20250223
When the soul is required it must be resigned_ and it is to no purpose to dispute it_ either by arms or arguments_ by ourselves_ or by any friend: There is no man that has power over his own spirit_ to retain it_ when it is summoned to return to God who gave it. It cannot fly any where out of the jurisdiction of death_ nor find any place where its writs do not run. It cannot abscond so as to escape death's eye_ though it is hidden from the eyes of all living. A man has no power to adjourn the day of his death_ nor can he by prayers or bribes obtain a reprieve; no bail will be taken_ no essoine [excuse]_ protection_ or imparlance [conference]_ allowed. We have not power over the spirit of a friend_ to retain that; the prince_ with all his authority_ cannot prolong the life of the most valuable of his subjects_ nor the physician with his medicines and methods_ nor the soldier with his force_ not the orator with his eloquence_ nor the best saint with his intercessions. The stroke of death can by no means be put by when our days are determined and the hour appointed us has come. ,20250223
When the sovereign is governed by principles of honour_ when the king is the son of nobles_ actuated and animated by a noble spirit_ which scorns to do any thing base and unbecoming so high a character_ which is solicitous for the public welfare_ and prefers that before any private interests. Wisdom_ virtue_ and the fear of God_ beneficence_ and a readiness to do good to all mankind_ these ennoble the royal blood,20250223
When the subordinate magistrates are more in care to discharge their trusts than to gratify their appetites; when they eat in due season (Ps. cxlv. 15); let us not take ours unseasonable_ lest we lose the comfort of seeing God give it to us. Magistrates should eat for strength_ that their bodies may be fitted to serve their souls in the service of God and their country_ and not for drunkenness_ to make themselves unfit to do any thing either for God or man_ and particularly to sit in judgment_ for they will err through wine (Isa. xxviii. will drink and forget the law_ Prov. xxxi,20250223
When the things of God are to be taught precept must be upon precept_ and line upon line_ not only because the things themselves are of great worth and weight_ but because men's minds_ at the best_ are unapt to admit them and commonly prejudiced against them; and therefore Solomon_ in this chapter_ with a great variety of expression and a pleasant powerful flood of divine eloquence_ inculcates the same things that he had pressed upon us in the foregoing chapters. Here is_,20250223
When the understanding is enlightened by the Spirit of grace our knowledge of divine things as far exceeds what we had before as that by ocular demonstration exceeds that by report and common fame. By the teachings of men God reveals his Son to us; but by the teachings of his Spirit he reveals his Son in us (Gal. i. and so changes us into the same image_ 2 Cor. iii,20250223
When they see that there is one event to the righteous and the wicked they wickedly infer thence that it is all one to God whether they are righteous or wicked_ and therefore they stick at nothing to gratify their lusts.,20250223
When those that are entrusted with the administration of public justice_ judges_ juries_ witnesses_ prosecutors_ counsel_ do either acquit the guilty or condemn those that are not guilty_ or in the least contribute to either; this defeats the end of government_ which is to protect the good and punish the bad_ Rom. xiii. 3_ 4. It is equally provoking to God to justify the wicked_ though it be in pity and in favorem vitæ—to safe life_ as to condemn the just,20250223
When those that take root in the world wither those that are grafted into Christ and partake of his root and fatness shall be fruitful and flourishing.,20250223
When those who are rich and high are sunk and impoverished_ and stand in need of comfort_ then those who before gathered about them stand aloof from them_ those who before commended them are forward to run them down. Thus those who raise their expectations high from the creature will find it fail them when it should help them; whereas those who make God their confidence have help in the time of need_ Heb. iv,20250223
When we are in the house of God_ in solemn assemblies for religious worship_ we are in a special manner before God and in his presence_ there where he has promised to meet his people_ where his eye is upon us and ours ought to be unto him.,20250223
When we are lamenting what is amiss in us_ we must not overlook the good that is wrought in us_ and preserved alive: __My heart wakes in Christ_ who is dear to me as my own heart_ and is my life; when I sleep_ he neither slumbers nor sleeps.__,20250223
When we are tempted to be harsh in our censures of those we differ from and dispute with we ought to consider that they also have understanding as well as we_ a capacity of judging_ and a right of judging for themselves; nay_ perhaps they are not inferior to us_ but superior_ and it is possible that they may be in the right and we in the wrong; and therefore we ought not to judge or despise them (Rom. xiv. nor pretend to be masters (Jam. iii. 1)_ while all we are brethren_ Matt. xxiii,20250223
When we are to speak either from God or to him it becomes us to address ourselves to it with a solemn pause_ and so to set bounds about the mount on which God is to come down_ and not be hasty to utter any thing. It was in a still small voice that the message was delivered_ and this was it (v. 17): __Shall mortal man be more just than God_ the immortal God? Shall a man be thought to be_ or pretend to be_ more pure than his Maker? Away with such a thought!__ 1. Some think that Eliphaz aims hereby to prove that Job's great afflictions were a certain evidence of his being a wicked man. A mortal man would be thought unjust and very impure if he should thus correct and punish a servant or subject_ unless he had been guilty of some very great crime: __If therefore there were not some great crimes for which God thus punishes thee_ man would be more just than God_ which is not to be imagined.__ 2. I rather think it is only a reproof of Job's murmuring and discontent:,20250223
When we have any great design on foot it is wisdom to take it before us_ and make the necessary preparations_ before we fall to work_ that_ when it is begun_ it may not stand still for want of materials. Solomon observed this rule himself in building the house of God; all was made ready before it was brought to the ground_ 1 Kings vi. 7.,20250223
When we have delight in it_ when knowledge becomes pleasant to the soul: __When thou beginnest to relish it as the most agreeable entertainment_ and art subject to its rules_ of choice_ and with satisfaction_—when thou callest the practice of virtue_ not a slavery and a task_ but liberty and pleasure_ and a life of serious godliness the most comfortable life a man can live in this world_—then thou wilt find the benefit of it.__ Though its restraints should be in some respects unpleasant to the body_ yet even those must be pleasant to the soul. When it has come to this_ with us_ discretion shall preserve us and keep us. God keeps the way of his saints,20250223
When we have done it we must not commend ourselves_ for that is an evidence of pride_ folly_ and self-love_ and a great lessening to a man's reputation. Every one will be forward to run him down that cries himself up. There may be a just occasion for us to vindicate ourselves_ but it does not become us to applaud ourselves. Proprio laus sordet in ore—Self-praise defiles the mouth.,20250223
When we have not a full assurance of Christ's love we must live by a faithful adherence to him. __Though I have not the sensible consolation I used to have_ yet I will cleave to this_ Christ is mine and I am his.__ ,20250223
When we look upon all the works of God and his providence_ and compare one part with another_ we cannot find that there is any such certain method by which the work that is done under the sun is directed; we cannot discover any key by which to decipher the character_ nor by consulting precedents can we know the practice of this court_ nor what the judgment will be. ,20250223
Whence com'st thou_ that thou art so fresh and fine?,20250223
Whence this desirable wealth is to be expected_ not by making ourselves drudges to the world (Ps. cxxvii. but by the blessing of God. It is this that makes rich and adds no sorrow; what comes from the love of God has the grace of God for its companion_ to preserve the soul from those turbulent lusts and passions of which_ otherwise_ the increase of riches is commonly the incentive. He had said (v.,20250223
Whence those difficulties arise which men pretend to meet with in the way of their duty_ and to be insuperable; they arise not from any thing in the nature of the duty_ but from the slothfulness of those that have really no mind to it. Those that have no heart to their work pretend that their way is hedged up with thorns_ and they cannot do their work at all (as if God were a hard Master_ reaping where he had not sown)_ at least that their way is strewed with thorns_ that they cannot do their work without a great deal of hardship and danger; and therefore they go about it with as much reluctance as if they were to go barefoot through a thorny hedge,20250223
Where grace reigns sin is loathsome. It is the undoubted character of every righteous man that he hates lying (that is_ all sin_ for every sin is a lie_ and particularly all fraud and falsehood in commerce and conversation)_ not only that he will not tell a lie_ but he abhors lying_ from a rooted reigning principle of love to truth and justice_ and conformity to God,20250223
Where it is thus it is owing to the sinner's own slothfulness and folly. He is a sluggard_ loves sleep_ hates labour; and he is void of understanding_ understands neither his business nor his interest; he is perfectly besotted. ,20250223
Where no oxen are there is nothing to be done at the ground_ and then nothing to be had out of it; the crib indeed is clean from dung_ which pleases the neat and nice_ that cannot endure husbandry because there is so much dirty work in it_ and therefore will sell their oxen to keep the crib clean; but then not only the labour_ but even the dung of the ox is wanted. This shows the folly of those who addict themselves to the pleasures of the country_ but do not mind the business of it_ who (as we say) keep more horses than kine_ more dogs than swine; their families must needs suffer by it,20250223
Where righteousness is riches are_ and the comforts of them: In the house of the righteous is much treasure. Religion teaches men to be diligent_ temperate_ and just_ and by these means_ ordinarily_ the estate is increased. But that is not all: God blesses the habitation of the just_ and that blessing makes rich without trouble. Or_ if there be not much of this world's goods_ yet where there is grace there is true treasure; and those who have but little_ if they have a heart to be therewith content_ and to enjoy the comfort of that little_ it is enough; it is all riches. The righteous perhaps are not themselves enriched_ but there is treasure in their house_ a blessing in store_ which their children after them may reap the benefit of. A wicked worldly man is only for having his belly filled with those treasures_ his own sensual appetite gratified (Ps. xvii. 14); but a righteous man's first care is for his soul and then for his seed_ to have treasure in his heart and then in his house_ which his relations and those about him may have the benefit of,20250223
Where sin reigns the man is loathsome. If his eyes were opened_ and his conscience awakened_ he would be so to himself_ he would abhor himself and repent in dust and ashes; however_ he is so to God and all good men; particularly_ he makes himself so by lying_ than which there is nothing more detestable. And_ though he may think to face it out awhile_ yet he will come to shame and contempt at last and will blush to show his face_ Dan. xii. 2.,20250223
Where there is no man to be employed in taking care of the productions. God's providence reaches further than man's industry. If he had not more kindness for many of the inferior creatures than man has_ it would go ill with them. God can make the earth fruitful without any art or pains of ours_ Gen. ii. 5_ 6. When there was not a man to till the ground_ yet there went up a mist and watered it. But we cannot make it fruitful without God; it is he that gives the increase. ,20250223
Where there is no man to be provided for nor to take the benefit of the fruits that are produced. Though God does with very peculiar favour visit and regard man_ yet he does not overlook the inferior creatures_ but causes the bud of the tender herb to spring forth for food for all flesh_ as well as for the service of man. Even the wild asses shall have their thirst quenched_ Ps. civ,20250223
Where wickedness is_ though there may be riches_ yet there is vexation of spirit with them: In the revenues of the wicked_ the great incomes they have_ there is trouble; for there is guilt and a curse; there is pride and passion_ and envy and contention; and those are troublesome lusts_ which rob them of the joy of their revenues and make them troublesome to their neighbours.,20250223
Wherein religion does very much consist—in humility and the fear of the Lord; that is_ walking humbly with God. We must so reverence God's majesty and authority as to submit with all humility to the commands of his word and the disposals of his providence. We must have such low thoughts of ourselves as to behave humbly towards God and man. Where the fear of God is there will be humility,20250223
Wheresoever the carcase is_ there will the eagles be gathered together. Every creature will make towards that which is its proper food; for he that provides the creatures their food has implanted in them that inclination. These and many such instances of natural power and sagacity in the inferior creatures_ which we cannot account for_ oblige us to confess our own weakness and ignorance and to give glory to God as the fountain of all being_ power_ wisdom_ and perfection.,20250223
Wherever we find Christ we must take him home with us to our houses_ especially to our hearts. The church is our mother_ and we should be concerned for her interests_ that she may have Christ present with her and be earnest in prayer for his presence with his people and ministers always. Those that enjoy the tokens of Christ's favour to their own souls should desire that the church_ and all religious assemblies in their public capacity_ might likewise enjoy the tokens of his favour.,20250223
Whether he employed the prophets in this work_ as Isaiah_ Hosea_ or Micah_ who lived in his time_ or some that were trained up in the schools of the prophets_ or some of the priests and Levites_ to whom we find him giving a charge concerning divine things,20250223
Whether the wise man himself rage or laugh_ whether he take the serious or the jocular way of dealing with the fool_ whether he be severe or pleasant with him_ whether he come with a rod or with the spirit of meekness (1 Cor. iv. it is all alike_ no good is done. We have piped unto you_ and you have not danced_ mourned unto you_ and you have not lamented.,20250223
Whether this leviathan be a whale or a crocodile is a great dispute among the learned_ which I will not undertake to determine; some of the particulars agree more easily to the one_ others to the other; both are very strong and fierce_ and the power of the Creator appears in them. The ingenious Sir Richard Blackmore_ though he admits the more received opinion concerning the behemoth_ that it must be meant of the elephant_ yet agrees with the learned Bochart's notion of the leviathan_ that it is the crocodile_ which was so well known in the river of Egypt. I confess that that which inclines me rather to understand it of the whale is not only because it is much larger and a nobler animal_ but because_ in the history of the Creation_ there is such an express notice taken of it as is not of any other species of animals whatsoever (Gen. i. 21_ God created great whales)_ by which it appears_ not only that whales were well known in those parts in the time of Moses_ who lived a little after Job_ but that the creation of whales was generally looked upon as a most illustrious proof of the eternal power and godhead of the Creator; and we may conjecture that this was the reason (for otherwise it seems unaccountable) why Moses there so particularly mentions the creation of the whales_ because God had so lately insisted upon the bulk and strength of that creature than of any other_ as the proof of his power; and the leviathan is here spoken of as an inhabitant of the sea (v. which the crocodile is not; and Ps. civ. 25_ 26_ there in the great and wide sea_ is that leviathan. Here in these verses_,20250223
Which are blackish by reason of the ice_ and wherein the snow is hid: 17 What time they wax warm_ they vanish: when it is hot_ they are consumed out of their place. 18 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing_ and perish. 19 The troops of Tema looked_ the companies of Sheba waited for them. 20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither_ and were ashamed. 21 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down_ and are afraid.,20250223
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth_ and forgetteth the covenant of her God. 18 For her house inclineth unto death_ and her paths unto the dead. 19 None that go unto her return again_ neither take they hold of the paths of life. 20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men_ and keep the paths of the righteous. 21 For the upright shall dwell in the land_ and the perfect shall remain in it. 22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth_ and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.,20250223
Which make oil within their walls_ and tread their winepresses_ and suffer thirst. 12 Men groan from out of the city_ and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.,20250223
Which way soever we receive the intimations of his will we must have our eye to him; whether he speaks by scripture_ ministers_ conscience_ or Providence_ we must take the word as from his mouth and bow our souls to it. Though_ in Job's time_ we do not know that there was any written word_ yet there was a revelation of God's will to be received. Eliphaz looked upon Job as a wicked man_ and was pressing him to repent and reform. Herein consists the conversion of a sinner—his receiving the law from God's mouth and no longer from the world and the flesh. Eliphaz_ being now in contest with Job_ appeals to the word of God for the ending of the controversy. __Receive that_ and be determined by it.__ To the law and to the testimony,20250223
Which wise men have told from their fathers_ and have not hid it: 19 Unto whom alone the earth was given_ and no stranger passed among them. 20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days_ and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor. 21 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. 22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness_ and he is waited for of the sword. 23 He wandereth abroad for bread_ saying_ Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him_ as a king ready to the battle. 25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God_ and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. 26 He runneth upon him_ even on his neck_ upon the thick bosses of his bucklers: 27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness_ and maketh collops of fat on his flanks. 28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities_ and in houses which no man inhabiteth_ which are ready to become heaps. 29 He shall not be rich_ neither shall his substance continue_ neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. 30 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches_ and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. 31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence. 32 It shall be accomplished before his time_ and his branch shall not be green. 33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine_ and shall cast off his flower as the olive. 34 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate_ and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. 35 They conceive mischief_ and bring forth vanity_ and their belly prepareth deceit.,20250223
While the sun_ or the light_ or the moon_ or the stars_ be not darkened_ nor the clouds return after the rain: 3 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble_ and the strong men shall bow themselves_ and the grinders cease because they are few_ and those that look out of the windows be darkened_ 4 And the doors shall be shut in the streets_ when the sound of the grinding is low_ and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird_ and all the daughters of music shall be brought low,20250223
While there is life there is an opportunity of preparing for death: The living know that which the dead have no knowledge of_ particularly they know that they shall die_ and are_ or may be_ thereby influenced to prepare for that great change which will come certainly_ and may come suddenly. Note_ The living cannot but know that they shall die_ that they must needs die. They know they are under a sentence of death; they are already taken into custody by its messengers_ and feel themselves declining. This is a needful useful knowledge; for what is our business_ while we live_ but to get ready to die: The living know they shall die; it is a thing yet to come_ and therefore provision may be made for it. The dead know they are dead_ and it is too late; they are on the other side the great gulf fixed,20250223
While we are following hard after Christ his right hand sustains us_ Ps. lxiii,20250223
Who are the men that are dangerous to the public—scornful men. When such are employed in the business of the state they do things with precipitation_ because they scorn to deliberate_ and will not take time for consideration and consultation; they do things illegal and unjustifiable_ because they scorn to be hampered by laws and constitutions; they break their faith_ because they scorn to be bound by their word_ and provoke the people_ because they scorn to please them. Thus they bring a city into a snare by their ill conduct_ or (as the margin reads it) they set a city on fire; they sow discord among the citizens and run them into confusion. Those are scornful men that mock at religion_ the obligations of conscience_ the fears of another world_ and every thing that is sacred and serious. Such men are the plagues of their generation; they bring God's judgments upon a land_ set men together by the ears_ and so bring all to confusion,20250223
Who are the men that are the blessings of a land—the wise men who by promoting religion_ which is true wisdom_ turn away the wrath of God_ and who_ by prudent counsels_ reconcile contending parties and prevent the mischievous consequences of divisions. Proud and foolish men kindle the fires which wise and good men must extinguish.,20250223
Who are the tempted—young people who have been well educated; these she will triumph most in being the ruin of. Observe,20250223
Who bid it welcome_ and are glad when they can find the grave and see themselves stepping into it. If the miseries of this life can prevail_ contrary to nature_ to make death itself desirable_ shall not much more the hopes and prospects of a better life_ to which death is our passage_ make it so_ and set us quite above the fear of it? It may be a sin to long for death_ but I am sure it is no sin to long for heaven.,20250223
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?—a clean performance from an unclean principle? Note_ Actual transgressions are the natural product of habitual corruption_ which is therefore called original sin_ because it is the original of all our sins. This holy Job here laments_ as all that are sanctified do_ running up the streams to the fountain (Ps. li. 5); and some think he intends it as a plea with God for compassion: __Lord_ be not extreme to mark my sins of human frailty and infirmity_ for thou knowest my weakness. O remember that I am flesh!__ The Chaldee paraphrase has an observable reading of this verse: Who can make a man clean that is polluted with sin? Cannot one? that is_ God. Or who but God_ who is one_ and will spare him? God_ by his almighty grace_ can change the skin of the Ethiopian_ the skin of Job_ though clothed with worms.,20250223
Who derives it from God. Having it not in himself_ he draws it with the bucket of prayer from the fountain of all wisdom_ who gives liberally. ,20250223
Who dig for it as for hidden treasures_ that is_ would give any thing for a fair dismission out of this world_ which supposes that then the thought of men's being their own executioners was not so much as entertained or suggested_ else those who longed for it needed not take much pains for it_ they might soon come at it (as Seneca tells them) if they are pleased,20250223
Who does good with it_ who draws out from the stock he has_ as wine from the vessel_ and communicates to others_ for their instruction_ things new and old. That is well got_ and to good purpose_ that is thus used to good purpose.,20250223
Who has begotten me these? 1. This is applicable to the Jewish church_ when_ after forty years' wandering in the wilderness_ they came out of it_ to take a glorious possession of the land of promise; and this may very well be illustrated by what Balaam said of them at that time_ when they ascended out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke_ and he stood admiring them: From the top of the rocks I see him. How goodly are thy tents_ O Jacob! Num.,20250223
Who has given to him_ and it shall be recompensed to him again? But Eliphaz here shows that the righteousness and perfection of the best man in the world are no real benefit or advantage to God_ and therefore cannot be thought to merit any thing from him. 1. Man's piety is no profit to God_ no gain_ v. 1_ 2. If we could by any thing merit from God_ it would be by our piety_ our being righteous_ and making our way perfect. If that will not merit_ surely nothing else will. If a man cannot make God his debtor by his godliness_ and honesty_ and obedience to his laws_ much less can he by his wit_ and learning_ and worldly policy. Now Eliphaz here asks whether any man can possibly be profitable to God. It is certain that he cannot. By no means. He that is wise may be profitable to himself. Note_ Our wisdom and piety are that by which we ourselves are_ and are likely to be_ great gainers. Wisdom is profitable to direct_ Eccl. x,20250223
Who hath first given to him_ and it shall be recompensed to him again? As God does not inflict upon us the evils we have deserved_ so he does bestow upon us the favours we have not deserved,20250223
Who hath laid the measures thereof_ if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? 6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof,20250223
Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 6 Whose house I have made the wilderness_ and the barren land his dwellings. 7 He scorneth the multitude of the city_ neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. 8 The range of the mountains is his pasture_ and he searcheth after every green thing. 9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee_ or abide by thy crib? 10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 11 Wilt thou trust him_ because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? 12 Wilt thou believe him_ that he will bring home thy seed_ and gather it into thy barn?,20250223
Who improves in it_ who_ having some understanding_ draws it out by growing in knowledge and making five talents ten. ,20250223
Who is the Lord_ that I should obey his voice? Observe_ First_ How slightly they speak of God: What is the Almighty? As if he were a mere name_ a mere cipher_ or one they have nothing to do with and that has nothing to do with them. Secondly_ How hardly they speak of religion. They call it a service_ and mean a hard service. Is it not enough_ they think_ to keep up a fair correspondence with the Almighty_ but they must serve him_ which they look upon as a task and drudgery. Thirdly_ How highly they speak of themselves: __That we should serve him; we who are rich and mighty in power_ shall we be subject and accountable to him? No_ we are lords___ Jer. ii.,20250223
Who knows the power of his anger?,20250223
Who leave the paths of uprightness_ to walk in the ways of darkness,20250223
Who long for death_ when they have out-lived their comforts and usefulness_ are burdened with age and infirmities_ with pain or sickness_ poverty or disgrace_ and yet it comes not; while_ at the same time_ it comes to many who dread it and would put it far from them. The continuance and period of life must be according to God's will_ not according to ours. It is not fit that we should be consulted how long we would live and when we would die; our times are in a better hand than our own,20250223
Who pretends to have received or given that which he never had_ which he never gave_ makes a noise of his great accomplishments and his good services_ but it is all false; he is not what he pretends to be. Or_ 2. Who promises what he will give and what he will do_ but performs nothing_ who raises people's expectations of the mighty things he will do for his country_ for his friends_ what noble legacies he will leave_ but either he has not wherewithal to do what he says or he never designs it. Such a one is like the morning-cloud_ that passes away_ and disappoints those who looked for rain from it to water the parched ground (Jude,20250223
Who rejoice to do evil_ and delight in the frowardness of the wicked,20250223
Who speaks—The Lord_ Jehovah_ not a created angel_ but the eternal Word himself_ the second person in the blessed Trinity_ for it is he by whom the worlds were made_ and that was no other than the Son of God. The same speaks here that afterwards spoke from Mount Sinai. Here he begins with the creation of the world_ there with the redemption of Israel out of Egypt_ and from both is inferred the necessity of our subjection to him. Elihu had said_ God speaks to men and they do not perceive it (ch. xxxiii. 14); but this they could not but perceive_ and yet we have a more sure word of prophecy_ 2 Pet. i. 19,20250223
Who takes pains for it_ as he does who draws ore out of the mine. It if do not come easily_ we must put the more strength to draw it. ,20250223
Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth_ and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 12 There they cry_ but none giveth answer_ because of the pride of evil men. 13 Surely God will not hear vanity_ neither will the Almighty regard it.,20250223
Who the persons are that are excluded from these pretensions—all_ one as well as another. Here_ in this imperfect state_ no person whatsoever can pretend to be without sin. Adam could say so in innocency_ and saints can say so in heaven_ but none in this life. Those that think themselves as good as they should be cannot_ nay_ and those that are really good will not_ dare not_ say this,20250223
Who they are that Wisdom here reproves and expostulates with. In general_ they are such as are simple_ and therefore might justly be despised_ such as love simplicity_ and therefore might justly be despaired of; but we must use the means even with those that we have but little hopes of_ because we know not what divine grace may do. Three sorts of persons are here called to:—,20250223
Who those are that are thus favoured. They are the righteous_ on whom the image of God is renewed_ which consists in righteousness_ and those who walk uprightly_ who are honest in their dealings both with God and man and make conscience of doing their duty as far as they know it. They are his saints_ devoted to his honour_ and set apart for his service. ,20250223
Who those are who_ though poor_ are in a fair way to become rich—those who are diligent and honest_ who are careful about their affairs_ and_ what their hands find to do_ do it with all their might_ in a fair and honourable way_ those are likely to increase what they have. The hand of the acute (so some)_ of those who are sharp_ but not sharpers; the hand of the active (so others); the stirring hand gets a penny. This is true in the affairs of our souls as well as in our worldly affairs; slothfulness and hypocrisy lead to spiritual poverty_ but those who are fervent in spirit_ serving the Lord_ are likely to be rich in faith and rich in good works.,20250223
Who those are who_ though rich_ are in a fair way to become poor—those who deal with a slack hand_ who are careless and remiss in their business_ and never mind which end goes foremost_ nor ever set their hands vigorously to their work or stick to it; those who deal with a deceitful hand (so it may be read); those who think to enrich themselves by fraud and tricking will_ in the end_ impoverish themselves_ not only by bringing the curse of God on what they have_ but by forfeiting their reputation with men; none will care to deal with those who deal with sleight of hand and are honest only with good looking to,20250223
Whoever bursts for envy_ let him burst.,20250223
Wholly abstain_ or wed.—Herbert. __The world is wide_ and there are varieties of accomplishments_ among which thou mayest please thyself.__,20250223
Whom God chastens he teaches (Ps. xciv. and the affliction makes people willing to learn_ softens the wax_ that it may receive the impression of the seal; yet it does not do this of itself_ but the grace of God working with and by it; it is he that opens the ear_ that opens the heart_ who has the key of David. ,20250223
Whom God runs upon he will certainly run down; for when he judges he will overcome. See how the judgments of God cross this worldly wicked man in all his cares_ desires_ and projects_ and so complete his misery. First_ He is in care to get_ but he shall not be rich_ v,20250223
Whoredom. This is another sin which takes away the heart that should be given to God_ Hos. iv.,20250223
Whose harvest the hungry eateth up_ and taketh it even out of the thorns_ and the robber swalloweth up their substance.,20250223
Whose ways are crooked_ and they froward in their paths:,20250223
Whoso breaks a hedge_ an old hedge_ that has long been a land-mark_ let him expect that a serpent_ or adder_ such as harbour in rotten hedges_ will bite him; some viper or other will fasten upon his hand_ Acts xxviii,20250223
Whoso removes stones_ to pull down a wall or building_ does but pluck them upon himself; he shall be hurt therewith_ and will wish that he had let them alone. Those that go about to alter a well-modelled well-settled government_ under colour of redressing some grievances and correcting some faults in it_ will quickly perceive not only that it is easier to find fault than to mend_ to demolish that which is good than to build up that which is better_ but that they thrust their own fingers into the fire and overwhelm themselves in the ruin they occasion. ,20250223
Why God should not be so strict in taking cognizance of him and of his slips and failings (v. 3): __Since I have such a corrupt nature within_ and am liable to so much trouble_ which is a constant temptation from without_ dost thou open thy eyes and fasten them upon such a one_ extremely to mark what I do amiss? ch. xiii,20250223
Why children should conduct themselves wisely and well_ and live up to their good education_ that they may gladden the hearts of their parents_ and not sadden them. Observe_ ,20250223
Why he should not be so severe in his dealings with him: __Lord_ I have but a little time to live. I must certainly and shortly go hence_ and the few days I have to spend here are_ at the best_ full of trouble. O let me have a little respite! v,20250223
Why parents should be careful to give their children a good education_ and to train them up in the ways of religion_ which_ if it obtain the desired effect_ they themselves will have the comfort of it_ or_ if not_ they will have for their support under their heaviness that they have done their duty_ have done their endeavour,20250223
Why should men meddle with a subject that has already been exhausted?,20250223
Wicked children are an affliction to both their parents. They are an occasion of anger to the father (so the word signifies)_ because they contemn his authority_ but of sorrow and bitterness to the mother_ because they abuse her tenderness. The parents_ being joint-sufferers_ should therefore bring mutual comfort to bear them up under it_ and strive to make it as easy as they can_ the mother to mollify the father's anger_ the father to alleviate the mother's grief,20250223
Wicked men are compared to the horse and the ass_ so brutish are they_ so unreasonable_ so unruly_ and not to be governed but by force or fear_ so low has sin sunk men_ so much below themselves. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt_ but as some by the grace of God are changed_ and become rational_ so others by custom in sin are hardened_ and become more and more sottish_ as the horse and the mule_ Ps. xxxii. 9,20250223
Wicked men are public nuisances_ not only the burdens_ but the plagues of their generation. The city is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked_ whose evil communications corrupt good manners_ are enough to debauch a town_ to ruin virtue in it_ and bring down the judgments of God upon it.,20250223
Wicked men fear the punishment of sin_ but they have not wisdom to improve their fears by making their escape_ and so the thing they feared comes upon them_ and their present terrors are earnests of their future torments,20250223
Wicked men harden themselves against God_ dispute his wisdom_ disobey his laws_ are impenitent for their sins and incorrigible under their afflictions; they reject the offers of his grace_ and resist the strivings of his Spirit; they make nothing of his threatenings_ and make head against his interest in the world. But have they prospered? Can they prosper? No; they are but treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath. Those that roll this will find it return upon them.,20250223
Wicked people are certainly a miserable people; though they prosper_ and prevail_ for a time_ the curse is as sure to them as the blessing is to the righteous: It shall not be well with the wicked_ as others think it is_ who judge by outward appearance_ and as they themselves expect it will be; nay_ woe to the wicked; it shall be ill with them (Isa. iii. 10_ 11); they shall be reckoned with for all the ill they have done; nothing that befals them shall be really well for them. Nihil potest ad malos pervenire quod prosit_ imo nihil quod non noceat—No event can occur to the wicked which will do them good_ rather no event which will not do them harm. Seneca. Note_ ,20250223
Wicked people may perhaps have here and there a well-wisher among those who are altogether such as themselves_ but among the generality of their neighbours they get ill-will; they may be feared_ but they are not loved_ and therefore when they perish there is shouting; every body takes a pleasure in seeing them disgraced and disarmed_ removed out of places of trust and power_ chased out of the world_ and wishes no greater loss may come to the town_ the rather because they hope the righteous may come in their stead_ as they into trouble instead of the righteous_ v,20250223
Wickedness is as sure a destruction. Those that live in contempt of God and man_ that are set on mischief_ with mischief they shall be filled. They shall be more mischievous_ shall be filled with all unrighteousness_ Rom. i,20250223
Wickedness is not only a reproach to the sinner himself_ but to all that are akin to him. He that keeps rakish company_ and spends his time and money with them_ not only grieves his parents_ but shames them; it turns to their disrepute_ as if they had not done their duty to him. They are ashamed that a child of theirs should be scandalous and abusive to their neighbours.,20250223
Wickedness shortens men's lives_ and frustrates their hopes: The years of the wicked_ that are spent in the pleasures of sin and the drudgery of the world_ shall be shortened. Cut down the trees that cumber the ground. And whatever comfort or happiness a wicked man promises himself_ in this world or the other_ he will be frustrated; for the expectation of the wicked shall perish; his hope shall be turned into endless despair.,20250223
Will God hear him then? In the troubles of this life_ God has told us that he will not hear the prayers of those who regard iniquity in their hearts (Ps. lxvi. 19) and set up their idols there (Ezek. xiv. nor of those who turn away their ear from hearing the law_ Prov. xxviii,20250223
Will you not rouse you to preserve yourself?,20250223
Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.,20250223
Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power of the king? Do that which is good_ as becomes a dutiful and loyal subject_ and thou shalt ordinarily have praise of the same. He that does no ill shall feel no ill and needs fear none.,20250223
Wisdom Eternal and Divine.,20250223
Wisdom and Folly.,20250223
Wisdom and grace are the honour of good men: He that has understanding_ that good understanding which those have that do the commandments_ wisdom is found in his lips_ that is_ it is discovered to be there_ and consequently that he has within a good treasure of it_ and it is derived thence for the benefit of others. It is a man's honour to have wisdom_ but much more to be instrumental to make others wise,20250223
Wisdom exceedingly wise_ for it carries along with it the evidence of its own excellency; it may be predicated of itself_ and this is encomium enough; you need say no more in praise of a man of understanding than this_ __He is an understanding man; he has wisdom; he is so wise as not to do mischief_ or if he has_ through oversight_ offended_ he is so wise as not to make a jest of it.__ Or_ to pronounce wisdom wise indeed_ read it thus: As it is a sport to a fool to do mischief_ so it is to a man of understanding to have wisdom and to show it. Besides the future recompence_ a good man has as much present pleasure in the restraints and exercises of religion as sinners can pretend to in the liberties and enjoyments of sin_ and much more_ and much better.,20250223
Wisdom has furnished her table_ Prov. ix. 1. He sits at this table to see his guests (Matt. xxii. to see that nothing be wanting that is fit for them; he sups with them and they with him (Rev. iii. 20); he has fellowship with them and rejoices in them; he sits at his table to bid them welcome_ and to carve for them_ as,20250223
Wisdom here is Christ_ in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; it is Christ in the word and Christ in the heart_ not only Christ revealed to us_ but Christ revealed in us. It is the word of God_ the whole compass of divine revelation; it is God the Word_ in whom all divine revelation centres; it is the soul formed by the word; it is Christ formed in the soul; it is religion in the purity and power of it. Glorious things are here spoken of this excellent person_ this excellent thing.,20250223
Wisdom is as good as an inheritance_ yea_ better too (so the margin reads it); it is more our own_ more our honour_ will make us greater blessings_ will remain longer with us_ and turn to a better account,20250223
Wisdom is here introduced as a magnificent and munificent queen_ very great and very generous; that Word of God is this Wisdom in which God makes known his goodwill towards men; God the Word is this Wisdom_ to whom the Father has committed all judgment. He who_ in the chapter before_ showed his grandeur and glory as the Creator of the world_ here shows his grace and goodness as the Redeemer of it. The word is plural_ Wisdoms; for in Christ are hid treasures of wisdom_ and in his undertaking appears the manifold wisdom of God in a mystery. Now observe here_,20250223
Wisdom is the honour of the wise: The prudent crown themselves with knowledge_ they look upon it as their brightest ornament_ and there is nothing they are so ambitious of; they bind it to their heads as a crown_ which they will by no means part with; they press towards the top and perfection of knowledge_ which will crown their beginnings and progress. They shall have the praise of it; wise heads shall be respected as if they were crowned heads. They crown knowledge (so some read it); they are a credit to their profession. Wisdom is not only justified_ but glorified_ of all her children.,20250223
Wisdom puts us in mind of our own faults (v. 22): __Be not enraged at those that speak ill of thee_ or wish ill to thee_ for oftentimes_ in that case_ if thou retire into thyself_ thy own conscience will tell thee that thou thyself hast cursed others_ spoken ill of them and wished ill to them_ and thou art paid in thy own coin.__ Note_ When any affront or injury is done us it is seasonable to examine our consciences whether we have not done the same_ or as bad_ to others; and if_ upon reflection_ we find we have_ we must take that occasion to renew our repentance for it_ must justify God_ and make use of it to qualify our own resentments. If we be truly angry with ourselves_ as we ought to be_ for backbiting and censuring others_ we shall be the less angry with others for backbiting and censuring us. We must show all meekness towards all men_ for we ourselves were sometimes foolish_ Tit. iii. 2_ 3; Matt. vii. 1_ 2; James iii. 1_ 2.,20250223
Wisdom rejoiced_ not so much in the rich products of the earth_ or the treasures hid in the bowels of it_ as in the habitable parts os it_ for her delights were with the sons of men; not only in the creation of man is it spoken with a particular air of pleasure (Gen. i.,20250223
Wisdom teaches us not to be quicksighted_ or quickscented_ in apprehending and resenting affronts_ but to wink at many of the injuries that are done us_ and act as if we did not see them (v.,20250223
Wisdom teaches us not to expect that those we deal with should be faultless; we ourselves are not so_ none are so_ no_ not the best. This wisdom strengthens the wise as much as any thing_ and arms them against the danger that arises from provocation (v. so that they are not put into any disorder by it. They consider that those they have dealings and conversation with are not incarnate angels_ but sinful sons and daughters of Adam: even the best are so_ insomuch that there is not a just man upon earth_ that doeth good and sinneth not_ v,20250223
Wisdom will erect a college_ or council of state. Wisdom will be of use_ ,20250223
Wisdom will prevent or redress these grievances: By a man_ that is_ by a people_ of understanding_ that come again to themselves and their right mind_ things are kept in a good order_ or_ if disturbed_ brought back to the old channel again. Or_ By a prince of understanding and knowledge_ a privy-counsellor_ or minister of state_ that will restrain or suppress the transgression of the land_ and take the right methods of healing the state thereof_ the good estate of it will be prolonged. We cannot imagine what a great deal of service one wise man may do to a nation in a critical juncture.,20250223
Wisdom will teach us how to construe those dark chapters of Providence so as to reconcile them with the wisdom_ holiness_ goodness_ and faithfulness of God. We must not think it strange; Solomon tells us there were instances of this kind in his time: __All things have I seen in the days of my vanity; I have taken notice of all that passed_ and this has been as surprising and perplexing to me as any thing.__ Observe_ Though Solomon was so wise and great a man_ yet he calls the days of his life the days of his vanity_ for the best days on earth are so_ in comparison with the days of eternity. Or perhaps he refers to the days of his apostasy from God (those were indeed the days of his vanity) and reflects upon this as one thing that tempted him to infidelity_ or at least to indifferency in religion_ that he saw just men perishing in their righteousness_ that the greatest piety would not secure men from the greatest afflictions by the hand of God_ nay_ and sometimes did expose men to the greatest injuries from the hands of wicked and unreasonable men. Naboth perished in his righteousness_ and Abel long before. He had also seen wicked men prolonging their lives in their wickedness; they live_ become old_ yea_ are mighty in power (Job xxi. yea_ and by their fraud and violence they screen themselves from the sword of justice. __Now_ in this_ consider the work of God_ and let it not be a stumbling-block to thee.__ The calamities of the righteous are preparing them for their future blessedness_ and the wicked_ while their days are prolonged_ are but ripening for ruin. There is a judgment to come_ which will rectify this seeming irregularity_ to the glory of God and the full satisfaction of all his people_ and we must wait with patience till then.,20250223
Wisdom will teach us to enchant the serpent we are to contend with_ rather than think to out-hiss it (v. 11): The serpent will bite if he be not by singing and music charmed and enchanted_ against which therefore he stops his ears (Ps. lviii. 4_ 5); and a babbler is no better to all those who enter the lists with him_ who therefore must not think by dint of words to out-talk him_ but be prudent management to enchant him. He that is lord of the tongue (so the phrase is)_ a ruler that has liberty of speech and may say what he will_ it is as dangerous dealing with him as with a serpent uncharmed; but_ if you use the enchantment of a mild and humble submission_ you may be safe and out of danger; herein wisdom_ the meekness of wisdom_ is profitable to direct. By long forbearing is a prince persuaded_ Prov. xxv,20250223
Wisdom will teach us to whet the tool we are to make use of_ rather than_ by leaving it blunt_ oblige ourselves to exert so much the more strength_ v,20250223
Wisdom's Exhortation.,20250223
Wisdom's Exhortations; Doom of Obdurate Sinners.,20250223
Wisdom_ that is_ religion and piety (for the wise man is here opposed to a sinner)_ is better than all military endowments or accoutrements_ for it will engage God for us_ and then we are safe in the greatest perils and successful in the greatest enterprises. If God be for us_ who can be against us or stand before us? 2. Hence he observes the commanding force and power of wisdom_ though it labour under external disadvantages (v. 17): The words of wise men are heard in quiet; what they speak_ being spoken calmly and with deliberation (though_ not being rich and in authority_ they dare not speak aloud nor with any great assurance)_ will be hearkened to and regarded_ will gain respect_ nay_ will gain the point_ and sway with men more than the imperious clamour of him that rules among fools_ who_ like fools_ chose him to be their ruler_ for his noise and blustering_ and_ like fools_ think he must by those methods carry the day with every body else. A few close arguments are worth a great many big words; and those will strike sail to fair reasoning who will answer those that hector and insult according to their folly. How forcible are right words! What is spoken wisely should be spoken calmly_ and then it will be heard in quiet and calmly considered. But passion will lessen the force even of reason_ instead of adding any force to it,20250223
Wise and good men have_ of old_ been perplexed with this difficulty_ how the prosperity of the wicked and the troubles of the righteous can be reconciled with the holiness and goodness of the God that governs the world. Concerning this Solomon here gives us his advice.,20250223
Wise men and fools are forgotten alike (v. 16): There is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool. It is promised to the righteous that they shall be had in everlasting remembrance_ and their memory shall be blessed_ and they shall shortly shine as the stars; but there is no such promise made concerning the wisdom of this world_ that that shall perpetuate men's names_ for those names only are perpetuated that are written in heaven_ and otherwise the names of this world's wise men are written with those of its fools in the dust. That which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. What was much talked of in one generation is_ in the next_ as if it had never been. New persons and new things jostle out the very remembrance of the old_ which in a little time are looked upon with contempt and at length quite buried in oblivion. Where is the wise? Where is the disputer of this world? 1 Cor. i.,20250223
Wise men and fools fare alike. __It is true the wise man has very much the advantage of the fool in respect of foresight and insight_ and yet the greatest probabilities do so often come short of success that I myself perceived_ by my own experience_ that one event happens to them all (v. 14); those that are most cautious of their health are as so on sick as those that are most careless of it_ and the most suspicious are imposed upon.__ David had observed that wise men die_ and are involved in the same common calamity with the fool and the brutish person_ Ps. xlix,20250223
With God there is a time for the re-hearing of causes_ redressing of grievances_ and reversing of unjust decrees_ though as yet we see it not here_ Job xxiv. 1.,20250223
With a haughty contempt and disdain of his friends and of that which they offered (v. 3): Wherefore are we counted as beasts? This was invidious. Job had indeed called them mockers_ had represented them both as unwise and as unkind_ wanting both in the reason and tenderness of men_ but he did not count them beasts; yet Bildad so represents the matter,20250223
With a regardlessness of what was said to him_ intimated in that_ Mark_ and afterwards we will speak. And it is to no purpose to speak_ though what is said be ever so much to the purpose_ if those to whom it is addressed will not mark and observe it. Let the ear be opened to hear as the learned_ and then the tongues of the learned will do good service (Isa. l. 4) and not otherwise. It is an encouragement to those that speak of the things of God to see the hearers attentive.,20250223
With all our increase. As God has prospered us in every thing_ we must honour him. Our law will allow a prescription for a modus decimandi—a mode of tithing_ but none de non decimando—for exemption from paying tithes. ,20250223
With all those good qualities she lacks not that one thing needful; she is truly pious_ and_ in all she does_ is guided and governed by principles of conscience and a regard to God; this is that which is here preferred far before beauty; that is vain and deceitful; all that are wise and good account it so_ and value neither themselves nor others on it. Beauty recommends none to God_ nor is it any certain indication of wisdom and goodness_ but it has deceived many a man who has made his choice of a wife by it. There may be an impure deformed soul lodged in a comely and beautiful body; nay_ many have been exposed by their beauty to such temptations as have been the ruin of their virtue_ their honour_ and their precious souls. It is a fading thing at the best_ and therefore vain and deceitful. A fit of sickness will stain and sully it in a little time; a thousand accidents may blast this flower in its prime; old age will certainly wither it and death and the grave consume it. But the fear of God reigning in the heart is the beauty of the soul; it recommends those that have it to the favour of God_ and is_ in his sight_ of great price; it will last for ever_ and bid defiance to death itself_ which consumes the beauty of the body_ but consummates the beauty of the soul.,20250223
With an abhorrence of the very thought of the contrary (v.,20250223
With an assurance of the truth of it: Yea_ surely_ v,20250223
With deadly glory should oppress our sight_,20250223
With fresh recruits they ne'er will be supplied_,20250223
With our increase. Where riches increase we are tempted to honour ourselves (Deut. viii. 17) and to set our hearts upon the world (Ps. lxii. 10); but the more God gives us the more we should study to honour him. It is meant of the increase of the earth_ for we live upon annual products_ to keep us in constant dependence on God. ,20250223
With our reproofs we must give them instruction_ and must teach them_ v,20250223
With pale lean cheeks and ghastly hollow eyes;,20250223
With the first-fruits of all_ as Abel_ Gen.,20250223
With what a solemn preface he introduces it_ v. 23_ 24. He breaks off his complaints abruptly_ to triumph his comforts_ which he does_ not only for his own satisfaction_ but for the edification of others. Those now about him_ he feared_ would little regard what he said_ and so it proved_ He therefore wished it might be recorded for the generations to come. O that my words were now written_ the words I am now about to say! As if he had said_ __I own I have spoken many unadvised words_ which I could wish might be forgotten_ for they will neither do me credit nor do others good. But I am now going to speak deliberately_ and that which I desire may be published to all the world and preserved for the generations to come_ in perpetuam rei memoriam—for an abiding memorial_ and therefore that it may be written plainly and printed_ or drawn out in large and legible characters_ so that he that runs may read it; and that it may not be left in loose papers_ but put into a book; or_ if that should perish_ that it may be engraven like an inscription upon a monument_ with an iron pen in lead_ or in the stone; let the engraver use all his art to make it a durable appeal to posterity.__ That which Job here somewhat passionately wished for God graciously granted him. His words are written; they are printed in God's book; so that_ wherever that book is read_ there shall this be told for a memorial concerning Job. He believed_ therefore he spoke.,20250223
With what an air of triumph and exultation does she cry out_ __It is the voice of my beloved_ it can be the voice of no other_ for none besides can speak to the heart and make that burn.__ 2. She sees him come_ sees the goings of our God_ our King_ Ps. xlviii,20250223
With what joy and triumph we ought to speak of God's grace towards us_ and with what satisfaction we should look back upon the special times and seasons when we were in his eyes as those that find favour; these were days never to be forgotten.,20250223
With what tenderness he speaks of Job_ and his present afflicted condition: __If we tell thee our mind_ wilt thou be grieved? Wilt thou take it ill? Wilt thou lay it to thy own heart as thy affliction or to our charge as our fault? Shall we be reckoned unkind and cruel if we deal plainly and faithfully with thee? We desire we may not; we hope we shall not_ and should be sorry if that should be ill resented which is well intended.__ Note_ We ought to be afraid of grieving any_ especially those that are already in grief_ lest we add affliction to the afflicted_ as David's enemies_ Ps. lxix,20250223
Without relief. He shall be irreparably broken_ and never able to piece again: He shall be broken without remedy. What relief can he expect that has disobliged all mankind? He shall come to his end and none shall help him_ Dan. xi. 45.,20250223
Without warning. It shall come suddenly: Suddenly shall he be broken_ to punish him for all the wicked arts he had to surprise people into his snares. ,20250223

Woe to those that are thus at ease in Zion_ Amos vi. 1_ 3_ 4; Luke xii,20250223
Working_ without talking_ will make men rich: In all labour of the head_ or of the hand_ there is profit; it will turn to some good account or other. Industrious people are generally thriving people_ and where there is something done there is something to be had. The stirring hand gets a penny. It is good therefore to keep in business_ and to keep in action_ and what our hand finds to do to do it with all our might,20250223
Works of God. (b. c. 1520.),20250223
Worldlings make gold their god_ saints make God their gold; and those that are enriched with his favour and grace may truly be said to have abundance of the best gold_ and best laid up. We read it_ __He shall be thy defence against the incursions of neighbouring spoilers: thy wealth shall not then lie exposed as it did to Sabeans and Chaldeans___ which_ some think_ is the meaning of that_ Thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacle_ taking it as a promise. __The iniquity or wrong designed against thee shall be put off and shall not reach thee.__ Note_ Those must needs be safe that have Omnipotence itself for their defence_ Ps. xci. 1-3.,20250223
Worldly sinful desires are insatiable_ ch. v,20250223
Worldly wealth is that which most men have their hearts very much upon_ but they generally mistake both in the nature of the thing they desire and in the way by which they hope to obtain it; we are therefore told here,20250223
Would we know what is to be got by sin? It profiteth us not. The works of darkness are unfruitful works. When profit and loss come to be balanced all the gains of sin_ put them all together_ will come far short of countervailing the damage. All true penitents are ready to own this_ and it is a mortifying consideration. Rom. vi. 21_ What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? 2. See what repentance is_ and what reason we have to repent. Would we approve ourselves true penitents? We must then_ with a broken and contrite heart_ confess our sins to God_ 1 John i,20250223
Yea_ if thou criest after knowledge_ and liftest up thy voice for understanding,20250223
Yes_ certainly they are_ very few. Lord_ let them not be all miserable_ all in the extremity of misery. I have but a little time to live; let me have some comfort of life while it does last.__ This plea fastens on the goodness of God's nature_ the consideration of which is very comfortable to an afflicted spirit. And_ if we would use this as a plea with God for mercy (__Are not my days few? Lord_ pity me__)_ we should use it as a plea with ourselves_ to quicken us to duty: __Are not my days few? Then it concerns me to redeem time_ to improve opportunities_ what my hand finds to do to do it with all my might_ that I may be ready for the days of eternity_ which shall be many.__ ,20250223
Yet Christ will_ when he pleases_ withdraw those extraordinary communications of himself_ for he is a free-agent_ and the Spirit_ as the wind_ blows where and when it listeth_ and in his pleasure it becomes us to acquiesce. But_ 3. Our care must be that we do nothing to provoke him to withdraw and to hide his face_ that we carefully watch over our own hearts and suppress every thought that may grieve his good Spirit. Let those that have comfort be afraid of sinning it away.,20250223
Yet Elihu thinks that Job_ being in great extremity_ did not know and consider this as he should_ that it was his own fault that he was not yet delivered. He concludes therefore that Job opens his mouth in vain (v. 16) in complaining of his grievances and crying for redress_ or in justifying himself and clearing up his own innocency; it is all in vain_ because he does not trust in God and wait for him_ and has not a due regard to him in his afflictions. He had said a great deal_ had multiplied words_ but all without knowledge_ all to no purpose_ because he did not encourage himself in God and humble himself before him. It is in vain for us either to appeal to God or to acquit ourselves if we do not study to answer the end for which affliction is sent_ and in vain to pray for relief if we do not trust in God; for let not that man who distrusts God think that he shall receive any thing from him_ James i,20250223
Yet he flattered himself with vain hopes_ ,20250223
Yet he is a proud creature and self-conceited. He would be wise_ would he thought so_ values himself upon the honour of wisdom_ though he will not submit to the laws of wisdom. He would be wise_ that is_ he reaches after forbidden wisdom_ and_ like his first parents_ aiming to be wise above what is written_ loses the tree of life for the tree of knowledge. Now is such a creature as this fit to contend with God or call him to an account? Did we but better know God and ourselves_ we should better know how to conduct ourselves towards God.,20250223
Yet he is not fair and candid in the application. He takes it for granted that Job's children (the death of whom was one of the greatest of his afflictions) had been guilty of some notorious wickedness_ and that the unhappy circumstances of their death were sufficient evidence that they were sinners above all the children of the east_ v,20250223
Yet he looks to the north_ and sees it clear that way_ which gives him hope that the clouds are not gathering for a deluge; they are covered_ but not surrounded_ with them. He expects that the wind will pass (so it may be read) and cleanse them_ such a wind as passed over the earth to clear it from the waters of Noah's flood (Gen. viii. 1)_ in token of the return of God's favour; and then fair weather will come out of the north (v. 22) and all will be well. God will not always frown_ nor contend for ever,20250223
Yet he maintains that_ in respect of lasting happiness and satisfaction_ the wisdom of this world gives a man very little advantage; for,20250223
Yet he prefers it before that of a covetous miser. This untimely birth has more rest than the other_ for this has some rest_ but the other has none; this has no trouble and disquiet_ but the other is in perpetual agitation_ and has nothing but trouble_ trouble of his own making. The shorter the life is the longer the rest; and the fewer the days_ and the less we have to do with this troublesome world_ the less trouble we know.,20250223
Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say_ Where is he? 8 He shall fly away as a dream_ and shall not be found: yea_ he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. 9 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.,20250223
Yet he speaks hardly of him_ and unbecomingly_ in saying that he had taken away his judgment (that is_ refused to do him justice in this controversy and to appear in defence of him)_ and that by continuing his troubles_ on which his friends grounded their censures of him_ he had taken from him the opportunity he hoped ere now to have of clearing himself. Elihu reproved him for this word (ch. xxxiv. 5); for God is righteous in all his ways_ and takes away no man's judgment. But see how apt we are to despair of favour if it be not shown us immediately_ so poor-spirited are we and so soon weary of waiting God's time. He also charges it upon God that he had vexed his soul_ had not only not appeared for him_ but had appeared against him_ and_ by laying such grievous afflictions upon him had quite embittered his life to him and all the comforts of it. We_ by our impatience_ vex our own souls and then complain of God that he has vexed them. Yet see Job's confidence in the goodness both of his cause and of his God_ that though God seemed to be angry with him_ and to act against him for the present_ yet he could cheerfully commit his cause to him.,20250223
Yet his judgment and conscience gave no check to his pleasures_ nor hindered him from exacting the very quintessence of the delights of sense_ v,20250223
Yet it was not so bad as Satan promised himself. Job cursed his day_ but he did not curse his God—was weary of his life_ and would gladly have parted with that_ but not weary of his religion; he resolutely cleaves to that_ and will never let it go. The dispute between God and Satan concerning Job was not whether Job had his infirmities_ and whether he was subject to like passions as we are (that was granted)_ but whether he was a hypocrite_ who secretly hated God_ and if he were provoked_ would show his hatred; and_ upon trial_ it proved that he was no such man. Nay_ all this may consist with his being a pattern of patience; for_ though he did thus speak unadvisedly with his lips_ yet both before and after he expressed great submission and resignation to the holy will of God and repented of his impatience; he condemned himself for it_ and therefore God did not condemn him_ nor must we_ but watch the more carefully over ourselves_ lest we sin after the similitude of this transgression.,20250223
Yet man is born unto trouble_ as the sparks fly upward. 8 I would seek unto God_ and unto God would I commit my cause: 9 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number: 10 Who giveth rain upon the earth_ and sendeth waters upon the fields: 11 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety. 12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty_ so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise. 13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. 14 They meet with darkness in the daytime_ and grope in the noonday as in the night. 15 But he saveth the poor from the sword_ from their mouth_ and from the hand of the mighty. 16 So the poor hath hope_ and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.,20250223
Yet still she missed of him: I could not find him; he gave me no answer. She had no evidence of his favour_ no sensible comforts_ but was altogether in the dark_ and in doubt concerning his love towards her. Note_ There are those who have a true love for Christ_ and yet have not immediate answers to their prayers for his smiles; but he gives them an equivalent if he strengthens them with the strength in their souls to continue seeking him_ Ps. cxxxviii,20250223
Yet they are given to many that do not make a good use of them_ to many to whom God does not give wisdom and grace to take the comfort of them and serve God with them. The gifts of common providence are bestowed on many to whom are denied the gifts of a special grace_ without which the gifts of providence often do more hurt than good.,20250223
Yet they will not be happy; for it is an abomination to them to depart from evil_ which is necessary to their being happy. Never let those expect any thing truly sweet to their souls that will not be persuaded to leave their sins_ but that roll them under their tongues as a sweet morsel.,20250223
Yet through the scent of water it will bud_ and bring forth boughs like a plant. 10 But man dieth_ and wasteth away: yea_ man giveth up the ghost_ and where is he? 11 As the waters fail from the sea_ and the flood decayeth and drieth up: 12 So man lieth down_ and riseth not: till the heavens be no more_ they shall not awake_ nor be raised out of their sleep. 13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave_ that thou wouldest keep me secret_ until thy wrath be past_ that thou wouldest appoint me a set time_ and remember me! 14 If a man die_ shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait_ till my change come. 15 Thou shalt call_ and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.,20250223
Yet we ought not to perplex ourselves about this_ since it may prove otherwise_ that what is well got may come to one that will use it well and do good with it. ,20250223
Yet_ 2. It must be owned that there is too much passion in what Job here says. The manner of expression is peevish. When he meant that God afflicts he ought not to have said_ He destroys both the perfect and the wicked; when he meant that God pleases himself with the trial of the innocent he ought not to have said_ He laughs at it_ for he doth not afflict willingly. When the spirit is heated_ either with dispute or with discontent_ we have need to set a watch before the door of our lips_ that we may observe a due decorum in speaking of divine things.,20250223
You have heard of the patience of Job (says the apostle_ Jam. v. 11) and have seen the end of the Lord_ that is_ what end the Lord_ at length_ put to his troubles. In the beginning of this book we had Job's patience under his troubles_ for an example; here_ in the close_ for our encouragement to follow that example_ we have the happy issue of his troubles and the prosperous condition to which he was restored after them_ which confirms us in counting those happy which endure. Perhaps_ too_ the extraordinary prosperity which Job was crowned with after his afflictions was intended to be to us Christians a type and figure of the glory and happiness of heaven_ which the afflictions of this present time are working for us_ and in which they will issue at last; this will be more than double to all the delights and satisfactions we now enjoy_ as Job's after-prosperity was to his former_ though then he was the greatest of all the men of the east. He that rightly endures temptation_ when he is tried_ shall receive a crown of life (Jam. i. as Job_ when he was tried_ received all the wealth_ and honour_ and comfort_ which here we have an account of.,20250223
Zophar begins very passionately_ and seems to be in a great heat at what Job had said. Being resolved to condemn Job for a bad man_ he was much displeased that he talked so like a good man_ and_ as it should seem_ broke in upon him_ and began abruptly (v. 2): Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer. He takes no notice of what Job had said to move their pity_ or to evidence his own integrity_ but fastens upon the reproof he gave them in the close of his discourse_ counts that a reproach_ and thinks himself therefore obliged to answer_ because Job had bidden them be afraid of the sword_ that he might not seem to be frightened by his menaces. The best counsel is too often ill taken from an antagonist_ and therefore usually may be well spared. Zophar seemed more in haste to speak than became a wise man; but he excuses his haste with two things:—1. That Job had given him strong provocation (v. 3): __I have heard the check of my reproach_ and cannot bear to hear it any longer.__ Job's friends_ I doubt_ had spirits too high to deal with a man in his low condition; and high spirits are impatient of contradiction_ and think themselves affronted if all about them do not say as they say; they cannot bear a check but they call it the check of their reproach_ and then they are bound in honour to return it_ if not to draw upon him that gave it,20250223
Zophar concludes like an orator (v. 29): This is the portion of a wicked man from God; it is allotted him_ it is designed him_ as his portion. He will have it at last_ as a child has his portion_ and he will have it for a perpetuity; it is what he must abide by: This is the heritage of his decree from God; it is the settled rule of his judgment_ and fair warning is given of it. O wicked man! thou shalt surely die_ Ezek. xxxiii,20250223
Zophar concludes with a brief account of the doom of wicked people (v. 20): But the eyes of the wicked shall fail. It should seem_ he suspected that Job would not take his counsel_ and here tells him what would then come of it_ setting death as well as life before him. See what will become of those who persist in their wickedness_ and will not be reformed. 1. They shall not reach the good they flatter themselves with the hopes of in this world and in the other. Disappointments will be their doom_ their shame_ their endless torment. Their eyes shall fail with expecting that which will never come. When a wicked man dies his expectation perishes_ Prov. xi,20250223
Zophar here speaks very good things concerning God and his greatness and glory_ concerning man and his vanity and folly: these two compared together_ and duly considered_ will have a powerful influence upon our submission to all the dispensations of the divine Providence.,20250223
Zophar is thought by some to be the same with Zepho_ a descendant from Esau_ Gen. xxvi,20250223
Zophar proceeds very plainly to show the ruin and destruction of wicked people_ insinuating that because Job was destroyed and ruined he was certainly a wicked man and a hypocrite. Observe_,20250223
Zophar_ as the other two_ here encourages Job to hope for better times if he would but come to a better temper.,20250223
Zophar_ having described the many embarrassments and vexations which commonly attend the wicked practices of oppressors and cruel men_ here comes to show their utter ruin at last.,20250223
and rejoiced in it as his bride_ Isa. lxii. 4_ 5. But more frequently is Christ represented as the bridegroom of his church (Matt. xxv. 1; Rom. vii. 4,20250223
and the church as the bride_ the Lamb's wife_ Rev. xix. 7; xxi. 2_ 9. Pursuant to this metaphor Christ and the church in general_ Christ and particular believers_ are here discoursing with abundance of mutual esteem and endearment. The best key to this book is the 45th Psalm_ which we find applied to Christ in the New Testament_ and therefore this ought to be so too. It requires some pains to find out what may_ probably_ be the meaning of the Holy Spirit in the several parts of this book; as David's songs are many of them level to the capacity of the meanest_ and there are shallows in them learned_ and there are depths in it in which an elephant may swim. But_ when the meaning is found out_ it will be of admirable use to excite pious and devout affections in us; and the same truths which are plainly laid down in other scriptures when they are extracted out of this come to the soul with a more pleasing power. When we apply ourselves to the study of this book we must not only_ with Moses and Joshua_ put off our shoe from off our foot_ and even forget that we have bodies_ because the place where we stand is holy ground_ but we must_ with John_ come up hither_ must spread our wings_ take a noble flight_ and soar upwards_ till by faith and holy love we enter into the holiest_ for this is no other than the house of God and this is the gate of heaven.,20250223
and therefore Job_ being now to answer him particularly_ begins with a How long too_ v,20250223
i. 14_ 15. It is no new thing for those that are of the loyal loving subjects of Zion's King to be misrepresented by the watchmen of Zion_ as enemies or scandals to his kingdom; they could not abuse and persecute them but by putting them into an ill name. Some apply it to those ministers who_ though watchmen by office_ yet misapply the word to awakened consciences_ and through unskillfulness_ or contempt of their griefs_ add affliction to the afflicted_ and make the hearts of the righteous sad whom God would not have made sad (Ezek. xiii. discouraging those who ought to be encouraged and talking to the grief of those whom God has wounded_ Ps. lix,20250223
i. 18) and they will ruin thee if thou dost not.__,20250223
i. 27 Troubles are the trials of friendship. When a man is afflicted he will see who are his friends indeed and who are but pretenders; for a brother is born for adversity_ Prov. xvii. 17; xviii. 24.,20250223
i. 6_ 7. The angels attended God's throne and Satan among them. One would have expected him to come and confess his malice against Job and his mistake concerning him_ to cry_ Pecavi—I have done wrong_ for belying one whom God spoke well of_ and to beg pardon; but_ instead of that_ he comes with a further design against Job. He is asked the same question as before_ Whence comest thou? and answers as before_ From going to and fro in the earth; as if he had been doing no harm_ though he had been abusing that good man.,20250223
i. 6; xi The wicked shall not go unpunished_ nor the righteous unrewarded_ for God has his eye upon both and knows their true character; this speaks as much comfort to saints as terror to sinners.,20250223
ii Note_ Those who build upon the sand choose a foundation which will be overflown when the rains descend and the floods come (Matt. vii. and then their building must needs fall and they perish in the ruins of it_ and repent of their folly when it is too late,20250223
ii. 1_ 2. Thirdly_ God easily can_ and (as far as is for his glory) certainly will_ blast and defeat all the designs of his and his people's enemies. How were the plots of Ahithophel_ Sanballat_ and Haman baffled! How were the confederacies of Syria and Ephraim against Judah_ of Gebal_ and Ammon_ and Amalek_ against God's Israel_ the kings of the earth and the princes against the Lord and against his anointed_ broken! The hands that have been stretched out against God and his church have not performed their enterprise_ nor have the weapons formed against Sion prospered. Fourthly_ That which enemies have designed for the ruin of the church has often turned to their own ruin (v.,20250223
ii. 22) applies this proverb to those that have known the way of righteousness but are turned from it; but God will spue them out of his mouth_ Rev. iii. 16.,20250223
ii. 26) that God makes the sinners drudges to the righteous; for the sinner he gives travail to gather and heap up_ that he may give to him that is good before God. ,20250223
iii Thou art fair in thyself and (which is more) pleasant to all that are thine. Many are fair enough to look at_ and yet the sourness of their temper renders them unpleasant; but thou art fair_ yea_ pleasant.__ Christ is pleasant_ as he is ours_ in covenant with us_ in relation to us. __Thou art pleasant now_ when the King sits at his table.__ Christ is always precious to believers_ but in a special manner pleasant when they are admitted into communion with him_ when they hear his voice_ and see his face_ and taste his love. It is good to be here. Having expressed her esteem of her husband's person_ she next_ like a loving spouse_ that is transported with joy for having disposed of herself so well_ applauds the accommodations he had for her entertainment_ his bed_ his house_ his rafters or galleries (v. which may be fitly applied to those holy ordinances in which believers have fellowship with Jesus Christ_ receive the tokens of his love and return their pious and devout affections to him_ increase their acquaintance with him and improve their advantages by him. Now_,20250223
iii. 1-6)_ where the duty prescribed to wives agrees with this description of a good wife; and with good reason is so much stress laid upon it_ since it contributes as much as any one thing to the keeping up of religion in families_ and the entail of it upon posterity_ that the mothers be wise and good; and of what consequence it is to the wealth and outward prosperity of a house every one is sensible. He that will thrive must ask his wife leave. Here is_,20250223
iii. 20_ 21_ but with Rev. xiv. 13_ where_ in times of persecution (and such Solomon is here describing)_ it is not the passion of man_ but the Spirit of God_ that says_ Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth. Note_ The condition of the saints that are dead_ and gone to rest with God_ is upon many accounts better and more desirable than the condition of living saints that are yet continued in their work and warfare,20250223
iv We must rejoice in God when we have nothing else to rejoice in_ and cleave to him_ yea_ though we cannot for the present find comfort in him. In a dying hour we must derive from him living comforts; and this is to trust in him though he slay us.,20250223
iv. 1)_ the violent perverting of justice and judgment_ Eccl. v,20250223
iv. 1_ &c._ and ch. vi. 5_ 6. The similitudes are here different from what they were before_ to show that the beauty of holiness is such as nothing in nature can reach; you may still say more of it_ and yet still come short of it. That commendation of the spouse_ ch. iv._ was immediately upon the espousals (ch. iii. this upon her return from a by-path (ch. vi. 13); yet this exceeds that_ to show the constancy of Christ's love to his people; he loves them to the end_ since he made them precious in his sight and honourable. The spouse had described the beauty of her beloved in ten particulars (ch. v. 11_ &c.); and now he describes her in as many_ for he will not be behindhand with her in respects and endearments. Those that honour Christ he will certainly honour_ and make honourable. As the prophet_ in describing the corruptions of degenerate Israel_ reckons from the sole of the foot even unto the head (Isa. i. so here the beauties of the church are reckoned from foot to head_ that_ as the apostle speaks_ when he is comparing the church_ as here_ to the natural body (1 Cor. xii. more abundant honour might be bestowed on those parts of the body which we think to be less honourable_ and which therefore lacked honour_ v,20250223
iv. 1-3)_ her hair_ her teeth_ her temples (v. 5-7)_ not because he could not have described it in other words_ and by other similitudes_ but to show that he had still the same esteem for her since her unkindness to him_ and his withdrawings from her_ that he had before. Lest she should think that_ though he would not quite cast her off_ yet he would think the worse of her while he knew her_ he says the same of her now that he had done; for those to whom much is forgiven will love the more_ and_ consequently_ will be the more loved_ for Christ has said_ I love those that love me. He is pleased with his people_ notwithstanding their weaknesses_ when they sincerely repent of them and return to their duty_ and commends them as if they had already arrived at perfection.,20250223
lviii. 3_ it is because we ask amiss_ Jam. iv,20250223
lxxviii. 3-6. If the thread of the knowledge of many ages be cut off by the carelessness of one_ and nothing be done to preserve it pure and entire_ all that succeed fare the worse. The authorities Eliphaz vouched were authorities indeed_ men of rank and figure (v. unto whom alone the earth was given_ and therefore you may suppose them favourites of Heaven and best capable of making observations concerning the affairs of this earth. The dictates of wisdom come with advantage from those who are in places of dignity and power_ as Solomon; yet there is a wisdom which none of the princes of this world knew_ 1 Cor. ii. 7_ 8.,20250223
lxxxix. 12); and we may suppose the other mountains here mentioned to be pleasant ones_ and so this is Christ's call to his spouse to come off from the world_ all its products_ all its pleasures_ to sit loose to all the delights of sense. All those must do so that would come with Christ; they must take their affections off from all present things; yea_ though they be placed at the upper end of the world_ on the top of Amana and the top of Shenir_ though they enjoy the highest satisfactions the creature can propose to give_ yet they must come away from them all_ and live above the tops of the highest hills on earth_ that they may have their conversation in heaven. Come from those mountains_ to go along with Christ to the holy mountain_ the mountain of myrrh_ v,20250223

And this is her care all the days of her life; not at first only_ or now and then_ when she is in a good humour_ but perpetually; and she is not weary of the good offices she does him: She does him good_ not only all the days of his life_ but of her own too; if she survive him_ still she is doing him good in her care of his children_ his estate_ and good name_ and all the concerns he left behind him.

Thus his will is done upon the face of the world in the earth_ that is_ among the children of men_ to whom God has an eye in all these things_ of whom it is said that he made them to dwell on the face of the earth_ Acts xvii,20250223
v These mark houses in the day-time_ mark the avenues of a house_ and on which side they can most easily force their entrance_ and then_ in the night_ dig through them_ either to kill_ or steal_ or commit adultery. The night favours the assault_ and makes the defence the more difficult; for the good man of the house knows not what hour the thief will come and therefore is asleep (Luke xii.,20250223
v Thus the disciples feared when they entered into a cloud_ Luke ix,20250223
v We see too the care which Providence takes of the poor sinful inhabitants of the earth_ who_ though obnoxious to his justice and lying at his mercy_ are thus preserved from being overwhelmed_ as they were once by the waters of a flood_ and will continue to be so_ because they are reserved unto fire. ,20250223
v Where is Job's house_ or the house of his eldest son_ in which his children were feasting? Enquire into the circumstances of Job's house and family_ and then ask_ Where are the dwelling-places of the wicked? and compare them together_ and you will soon see that Job's house is in the same predicament with the houses of tyrants and oppressors_ and may therefore conclude that doubtless he was such a one.__,20250223
v Whereas Zophar had spoken of their continual frights and terrors_ Job says_ Their houses are safe both from danger and from the fear of it (v. and so far are they from the killing wounds of God's sword or arrows that they do not feel the smart of so much as the rod of God upon them. [3.],20250223
v. 15_ &c._ where he makes an inventory of the bona notabilia—the most valuable treasures of this world. Gold is five times mentioned; silver comes in also; and then several precious stones_ the onyx and sapphire_ pearls and rubies_ and the topaz of Ethiopia. These are the things that are highest prized in the world's markets: but if a man would give_ not only these_ heaps of these_ but all the substance of his house_ all he is worth in the world_ for wisdom_ it would utterly be contemned. These may give a man some advantage in seeking wisdom_ as they did to Solomon_ but there is no purchasing wisdom with these. It is a gift of the Holy Ghost_ which cannot be bought with money_ Acts viii,20250223
v. 18. 2. He is so sure of the goodness of his own cause that he longs to be opening it at God's bar,20250223
v. 20. I. He cautions all people to keep out of the way of temptations to this sin (v. 31): Look not thou upon the wine when it is red. Red wine was in Canaan looked upon as the best wine_ it is therefore called the blood of the grape. Critics judge of wine_ among other indications_ by the colour of it; some wine_ they say_ looks charmingly_ looks so well that it even says_ __Come and drink me;__ it moves itself aright_ goes down very smoothly_ or perhaps the roughness of it is grateful. It is said of generous strong-bodied wine that it even causes the lips of those that are asleep to speak_ Cant.,20250223
v. 26-29. The sword and the spear_ which wound nigh at hand_ are nothing to him; the darts_ arrows_ and sling-stones_ which wound at a distance_ do him no damage; nature has so well armed him cap-a-pie—at all points_ against them all. The defensive weapons which men use when they engage with the leviathan_ as the habergeon_ or breast-plate_ often serve men no more than their offensive weapons; iron and brass are to him as straw and rotten wood_ and he laughs at them. It is the picture of a hard-hearted sinner_ that despises the terrors of the Almighty and laughs at all the threatenings of his word. The leviathan so little dreads the weapons that are used against him that_ to show how hardy he is_ he chooses to lie on the sharp stones_ the sharp-pointed things (v. and lies as easy there as if he lay on the soft mire. Those that would endure hardness must inure themselves to it.,20250223
v. 6_ 7. Note_ It is of great use to us_ in every thing wherein we have to do with God_ to keep up good thoughts of him. He believes,20250223
vi. 31); and_ if you were for ever silent_ the heavens would declare his righteousness,20250223
vi. 6-8. Much of religion lies in doing judgment and justice from a principle of duty to God_ contempt of the world_ and love to our neighbour; and this is more pleasing to God than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices_ Mark xii. 33.,20250223
vii But look not thou upon it. 1. __Be not ruled by sense_ but by reason and religion. Covet not that which pleases the eye_ in hopes that it will please the taste; but let thy serious thoughts correct the errors of thy senses and convince thee that that which seems delightful is really hurtful_ and resolve against it accordingly. Let not the heart walk after the eye_ for it is a deceitful guide.__ 2. __Be not too bold with the charms of this or any other sin; look not_ lest thou lust_ lest thou take the forbidden fruit.__ Note Those that would be kept from any sin must keep themselves from all the occasions and beginnings of it_ and be afraid of coming within the reach of its allurements_ lest they be overcome by them.,20250223
vii. 15_ 16; ix. 15_ 16. This is quoted by the apostle (1 Cor. iii. 19) to show how the learned men of the heathen were befooled by their own vain philosophy. Fifthly_ When God infatuates men they are perplexed_ and at a loss_ even in those things that seem most plain and easy (v. 14): They meet with darkness even in the day-time: nay (as in the margin)_ They run themselves into darkness by the violence and precipitation of their own counsels. See ch. xii. 20_ 24_ 25.,20250223
who do_ Matt. xiii. 14_ 16. Experienced Christians here find a counterpart of their experiences_ and to them it is intelligible_ while those neither understand it nor relish it who have no part nor lot in the matter. It is a son_ an Epithalamium_ or nuptial song_ wherein_ by the expressions of love between a bridegroom and his bride_ are set forth and illustrated the mutual affections that pass between God and a distinguished remnant of mankind. It is a pastoral; the bride and bridegroom_ for the more lively representation of humility and innocence_ are brought in as a shepherd and his shepherdess. Now,20250223
x Or_ 2. She brought it thither. Her bowels being moved for her beloved_ who had stood so long in the cold and wet_ when she came to open to him she prepared to anoint his head_ and so to refresh and comfort him_ and perhaps to prevent his catching cold; she was in such haste to meet him that she would not stay to make the usual preparation_ but dipped her hand in her box of ointment_ that she might readily anoint his head at his first coming in. Those that open the doors of their hearts to Christ_ those everlasting doors_ must meet him with the lively exercises of faith and other graces_ and with these must anoint him.,20250223
x. 24 He took no great complacency in it (v. 25): If I rejoiced because my wealth was great and boasted that my hand had gotten much. He took no pride in his wealth_ as if it added any thing to his real excellency_ nor did he think that his might and the power of his hand obtained it for him_ Deut. viii,20250223
xi On the wicked God shall rain fire and brimstone. There is no fence against this_ but in Christ_ who is the only covert from the storm and tempest_ Isa. xxxii,20250223
xii. 1)_ another his holiness (Hab. i. another his goodness to his own people_ Ps. lxxiii. 1. General truths must be held fast_ though we may find it difficult to reconcile them to particular events,20250223
xii. 1. 2. That those who are advanced above others in grandeur and gravity do not always proportionably go beyond them in knowledge and wisdom (v. 9): Great men are not always wise; it is a pity but they were_ for then they would never do hurt with their greatness and would do so much the more good with their wisdom. Men should be preferred for their wisdom_ and those that are in honour and power have most need of wisdom and have the greatest opportunity of improving in it; and yet it does not follow that great men are always wise_ and therefore it is folly to subscribe to the dictates of any with an implicit faith. The aged do not always understand judgment; even they may be mistaken_ and therefore must not expect to bring every thought into obedience to them: nay_ therefore they must not take it as an affront to be contradicted_ but rather take it as a kindness to be instructed_ by their juniors: Therefore I said_ hearken to me_ v,20250223
xii. 1. And we must not only walk in that way awhile_ but we must keep it_ keep in it_ and never turn aside out of it: The paths of the righteous are the paths of life_ which all that are wise_ having taken hold of_ will keep their hold of. __That thou mayest imitate those excellent persons_ the patriarchs and prophets (so bishop Patrick paraphrases it)_ and be preserved in the paths of those righteous men who followed after them.__ We must not only choose our way in general by the good examples of the saints_ but must also take directions from them in the choice of our particular paths; observe the track_ and go forth by the footsteps of the flock. Two reasons are here given why we should thus choose:—,20250223
xii. 36) and eat the riches of the Gentiles_ Isa. lxi. 6.,20250223
xiii See his humility and modesty. He pretends not to have understood it fully_ but something of it he perceived,20250223
xiii We must not only have that ready to us_ for the service of Christ_ which we have heard_ and learned_ and experienced lately_ but must retain that which we have formerly gathered; nor must we content ourselves only with what we have laid up in store in the days of old_ but_ as long as we live_ must be still adding something new to it_ that our stock may increase_ and we may be thoroughly furnished for every good work. ,20250223
xiii. 1. Thus believers stand affected to Christ: the gifts of his providence cannot satisfy them without the assurances of his love.,20250223
xiii. 7); he was a child all the days of his life and his family and kingdom fared the worse for it. Nor is it much better with a people when their princes eat in the morning_ that is_ make a god of their belly and make themselves slaves to their appetites. If the king himself be a child_ yet if the princes and privy-counsellors are wise and faithful_ and apply themselves to business_ the land may do the better; but if they addict themselves to their pleasures_ and prefer the gratifications of the flesh before the despatch of the public business_ which they disfit themselves for by eating and drinking in a morning_ when judges are epicures_ and do not eat to live_ but live to eat_ what good can a nation expect! 2. The people cannot but be happy when their rulers are generous and active_ sober and temperate_ and men of business_ v,20250223
xiv. 31); and_ when it is begun_ consider how and by what arts it may be prosecuted_ for management is as necessary as courage. Going to law is a kind of going to war_ and therefore must be done with good advice_ Prov. xxv,20250223
xl. 12); and he can punish the children of men either by the defect or by the excess of them. As men break the laws of virtue by extremes on each hand_ both defects and excesses_ while virtue is in the mean_ so God corrects them by extremes_ and denies them the mercy which is in the mean.,20250223
xv And God saith of Israel_ Who is like thee? Deut. xxxiii,20250223
xv Cursed be the day wherein I was born_ Jer. xx. 14_ &c. We may suppose that Job in his prosperity had many a time blessed God for the day of his birth_ and reckoned it a happy day; yet now he brands it with all possible marks of infamy. When we consider the iniquity in which we were conceived and born we have reason enough to reflect with sorrow and shame upon the day of our birth_ and to say that the day of our death_ by which we are freed from sin (Rom. vi. is far better. Eccl. vii. 1. But to curse the day of our birth because then we entered upon the calamitous scene of life is to quarrel with the God of nature_ to despise the dignity of our being_ and to indulge a passion which our own calm and sober thoughts will make us ashamed of. Certainly there is no condition of life a man can be in in this world but he may in it (if it be not his own fault) so honour God_ and work out his own salvation_ and make sure a happiness for himself in a better world_ that he will have no reason at all to wish he had never been born_ but a great deal of reason to say that he had his being to good purpose. Yet it must be owned_ if there were not another life after this_ and divine consolations to support us in the prospect of it_ so many are the sorrows and troubles of this that we might sometimes be tempted to say that we were made in vain (Ps. lxxxix. and to wish we had never been. There are those in hell who with good reason wish they had never been born_ as Judas_ Matt. xxvi,20250223
xv. 16. 29 Judgments are prepared for scorners_ and stripes for the back of fools.,20250223
xvi. 26); it is but food and raiment; what is more others have_ not we; it is all for the mouth. Meats are but for the belly and the belly for meats; there is nothing for the head and heart_ nothing to nourish or enrich the soul. A little will serve to sustain us comfortably and a great deal can do no more.,20250223

xxii __I do___ says he_ __and always did_ that I might not sin against him_ and that_ like the good householder_ I might bring forth for the good of others.__ Note_ The word of God is to our souls what our necessary food is to our bodies; it sustains the spiritual life and strengthens us for the actions of life; it is that which we cannot subsist without_ and which nothing else can make up the want of: and we ought therefore so to esteem it_ to take pains for it_ hunger after it_ feed upon it with delight_ and nourish our souls with it; and this will be our rejoicing in the day of evil_ as it was Job's here.,20250223
xxii. 9_ 10. Here he thinks the application easy_ and that Job might_ in this description_ as in a glass_ see his own face. Now_,20250223
xxiii We may be soon made as sick of them as we are now fond of them; and those who live in luxury when they are well_ if ever they come_ by reason of sickness_ to loathe dainty meat_ may_ with grief and shame_ read their sin in their punishment. Let us not inordinately love the taste of meat_ for the time may come when we may even loathe the sight of meat_ Ps. cvii. 18,20250223
xxiv God shall give him grace to go and sin no more. Perhaps this may denote the reformation of his life after his recovery. As he shall pray unto God_ whom before he had slighted_ so he shall render to man his righteousness_ whom before he had wronged_ shall make restitution_ and for the future do justly.,20250223
xxvii Or_ He shall deliver those that are not innocent_ and they are delivered by the pureness of thy hands; as it may be read_ and most probably. Note_ A good man is a public good. Sinners fare the better for saints_ whether they are aware of it or no. If Eliphaz intended hereby (as some think he did) to insinuate that Job's prayers were not prevailing_ nor his hands pure (for then he would have relieved others_ much more himself)_ he was afterwards made to see his error_ when it appeared that Job had a better interest in heaven than he had; for he and his three friends_ who in this matter were not innocent_ were delivered by the pureness of Job's hands_ ch. xlii. 8.,20250223
xxviii Job_ in this protestation_ intimates two things_ which were certain evidences of his integrity:—1. That he was not guilty of any great transgression or iniquity_ inconsistent with sincerity_ which he had now industriously concealed. In this protestation he had dealt fairly_ and_ while he denies some sins_ was not conscious to himself that he allowed himself in any,20250223
xxviii. 24. The Love of the Church to Christ.,20250223
xxxii. 14) __and the fattest of the flesh.__ Note_ It ought to silence us under our afflictions to consider that_ if we were better_ it would be every way better with us: if we had answered the ends of an affliction_ the affliction would be removed; and deliverance would come if we were ready for it. God would have done well for us if we had conducted ourselves well; Ps. lxxxi. 13_ 14; Isa. xlviii.,20250223
xxxix. 1)_ would not suffer his mouth to sin_ and therefore durst not imprecate any evil_ no_ not to his worst enemy. If others bear malice to us_ that will not justify us in bearing malice to them.,20250223
xxxix. 1. But this freedom of speech_ which their professions of concern for him made him use_ had exposed him to their censures_ and so they might be said to dig a pit for him. Thus_ when our hearts are hot within us_ what is ill done we are apt to misrepresent as if done designedly.,20250223
xxxvii. 3_ 19. In time of war_ when thousands fall on the right and left hand_ he shall redeem thee from the power of the sword. If God please_ it shall not touch thee; or if it wound thee_ if it kill thee_ it shall not hurt thee; it can but kill the body_ nor has it power to do that unless it be given from above.__,20250223
