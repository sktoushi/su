1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David_ king of Israel: ,20250217
2 To know wisdom and instruction_ To discern the sayings of understanding_ ,20250217
3 To receive instruction in wise behavior_ Righteousness_ justice and equity; ,20250217
4 To give prudence to the naive_ To the youth knowledge and discretion_ ,20250217
5 A wise man will hear and increase in learning_ And a man of understanding will acquire wise counsel_ ,20250217
6 To understand a proverb and a figure_ The words of the wise and their riddles. ,20250217
7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction. ,20250217
8 Hear_ my son_ your father's instruction And do not forsake your mother's teaching; ,20250217
9 Indeed_ they are a graceful wreath to your head And ornaments about your neck. ,20250217
10 My son_ if sinners entice you_ Do not consent. ,20250217
11 If they say_ __Come with us_ Let us lie in wait for blood_ Let us ambush the innocent without cause; ,20250217
12 Let us swallow them alive like Sheol_ Even whole_ as those who go down to the pit; ,20250217
13 We will find all {kinds} of precious wealth_ We will fill our houses with spoil; ,20250217
14 Throw in your lot with us_ We shall all have one purse___ ,20250217
15 My son_ do not walk in the way with them. Keep your feet from their path_ ,20250217
16 For their feet run to evil And they hasten to shed blood. ,20250217
17 Indeed_ it is useless to spread the {baited} net In the sight of any bird; ,20250217
18 But they lie in wait for their own blood; They ambush their own lives. ,20250217
19 So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence; It takes away the life of its possessors. ,20250217
20 Wisdom shouts in the street_ She lifts her voice in the square; ,20250217
21 At the head of the noisy {streets} she cries out; At the entrance of the gates in the city she utters her sayings: ,20250217
22 __How long_ O naive ones_ will you love being simple-minded? And scoffers delight themselves in scoffing And fools hate knowledge? ,20250217
23 __Turn to my reproof_ Behold_ I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you. ,20250217
24 __Because I called and you refused_ I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention; ,20250217
25 And you neglected all my counsel And did not want my reproof; ,20250217
26 I will also laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your dread comes_ ,20250217
27 When your dread comes like a storm And your calamity comes like a whirlwind_ When distress and anguish come upon you. ,20250217
28 __Then they will call on me_ but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently but they will not find me_ ,20250217
29 Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the LORD. ,20250217
30 __They would not accept my counsel_ They spurned all my reproof. ,20250217
31 __So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way And be satiated with their own devices. ,20250217
32 __For the waywardness of the naive will kill them_ And the complacency of fools will destroy them. ,20250217
33 __But he who listens to me shall live securely And will be at ease from the dread of evil.__ ,20250217
1 My son_ if you will receive my words And treasure my commandments within you_ ,20250217
2 Make your ear attentive to wisdom_ Incline your heart to understanding; ,20250217
3 For if you cry for discernment_ Lift your voice for understanding; ,20250217
4 If you seek her as silver And search for her as for hidden treasures; ,20250217
5 Then you will discern the fear of the LORD And discover the knowledge of God. ,20250217
6 For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth {come} knowledge and understanding. ,20250217
7 He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; {He is} a shield to those who walk in integrity_ ,20250217
8 Guarding the paths of justice_ And He preserves the way of His godly ones. ,20250217
9 Then you will discern righteousness and justice And equity {and} every good course. ,20250217
10 For wisdom will enter your heart And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul; ,20250217
11 Discretion will guard you_ Understanding will watch over you_ ,20250217
12 To deliver you from the way of evil_ From the man who speaks perverse things; ,20250217
13 From those who leave the paths of uprightness To walk in the ways of darkness; ,20250217
14 Who delight in doing evil And rejoice in the perversity of evil; ,20250217
15 Whose paths are crooked_ And who are devious in their ways; ,20250217
16 To deliver you from the strange woman_ From the adulteress who flatters with her words; ,20250217
17 That leaves the companion of her youth And forgets the covenant of her God; ,20250217
18 For her house sinks down to death And her tracks {lead} to the dead; ,20250217
19 None who go to her return again_ Nor do they reach the paths of life. ,20250217
20 So you will walk in the way of good men And keep to the paths of the righteous. ,20250217
21 For the upright will live in the land And the blameless will remain in it; ,20250217
22 But the wicked will be cut off from the land And the treacherous will be uprooted from it. ,20250217
1 My son_ do not forget my teaching_ But let your heart keep my commandments; ,20250217
2 For length of days and years of life And peace they will add to you. ,20250217
3 Do not let kindness and truth leave you; Bind them around your neck_ Write them on the tablet of your heart. ,20250217
4 So you will find favor and good repute In the sight of God and man. ,20250217
5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart And do not lean on your own understanding. ,20250217
6 In all your ways acknowledge Him_ And He will make your paths straight. ,20250217
7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. ,20250217
8 It will be healing to your body And refreshment to your bones. ,20250217
9 Honor the LORD from your wealth And from the first of all your produce; ,20250217
10 So your barns will be filled with plenty And your vats will overflow with new wine. ,20250217
11 My son_ do not reject the discipline of the LORD Or loathe His reproof_ ,20250217
12 For whom the LORD loves He reproves_ Even as a father {corrects} the son in whom he delights. ,20250217
13 How blessed is the man who finds wisdom And the man who gains understanding. ,20250217
14 For her profit is better than the profit of silver And her gain better than fine gold. ,20250217
15 She is more precious than jewels; And nothing you desire compares with her. ,20250217
16 Long life is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor. ,20250217
17 Her ways are pleasant ways And all her paths are peace. ,20250217
18 She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her_ And happy are all who hold her fast. ,20250217
19 The LORD by wisdom founded the earth_ By understanding He established the heavens. ,20250217
20 By His knowledge the deeps were broken up And the skies drip with dew. ,20250217
21 My son_ let them not vanish from your sight; Keep sound wisdom and discretion_ ,20250217
22 So they will be life to your soul And adornment to your neck. ,20250217
23 Then you will walk in your way securely And your foot will not stumble. ,20250217
24 When you lie down_ you will not be afraid; When you lie down_ your sleep will be sweet. ,20250217
25 Do not be afraid of sudden fear Nor of the onslaught of the wicked when it comes; ,20250217
26 For the LORD will be your confidence And will keep your foot from being caught. ,20250217
27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due_ When it is in your power to do {it.} ,20250217
28 Do not say to your neighbor_ __Go_ and come back_ And tomorrow I will give {it_}__ When you have it with you. ,20250217
29 Do not devise harm against your neighbor_ While he lives securely beside you. ,20250217
30 Do not contend with a man without cause_ If he has done you no harm. ,20250217
31 Do not envy a man of violence And do not choose any of his ways. ,20250217
32 For the devious are an abomination to the LORD; But He is intimate with the upright. ,20250217
33 The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked_ But He blesses the dwelling of the righteous. ,20250217
34 Though He scoffs at the scoffers_ Yet He gives grace to the afflicted. ,20250217
35 The wise will inherit honor_ But fools display dishonor. ,20250217
1 Hear_ {O} sons_ the instruction of a father_ And give attention that you may gain understanding_ ,20250217
2 For I give you sound teaching; Do not abandon my instruction. ,20250217
3 When I was a son to my father_ Tender and the only son in the sight of my mother_ ,20250217
4 Then he taught me and said to me_ __Let your heart hold fast my words; Keep my commandments and live; ,20250217
5 Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding! Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth. ,20250217
6 __Do not forsake her_ and she will guard you; Love her_ and she will watch over you. ,20250217
7__ The beginning of wisdom {is:} Acquire wisdom; And with all your acquiring_ get understanding. ,20250217
8 __ Prize her_ and she will exalt you; She will honor you if you embrace her. ,20250217
9 __She will place on your head a garland of grace; She will present you with a crown of beauty.__ ,20250217
10 Hear_ my son_ and accept my sayings And the years of your life will be many. ,20250217
11 I have directed you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in upright paths. ,20250217
12 When you walk_ your steps will not be impeded; And if you run_ you will not stumble. ,20250217
13 Take hold of instruction; do not let go. Guard her_ for she is your life. ,20250217
14 Do not enter the path of the wicked And do not proceed in the way of evil men. ,20250217
15 Avoid it_ do not pass by it; Turn away from it and pass on. ,20250217
16 For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; And they are robbed of sleep unless they make {someone} stumble. ,20250217
17 For they eat the bread of wickedness And drink the wine of violence. ,20250217
18 But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn_ That shines brighter and brighter until the full day. ,20250217
19 The way of the wicked is like darkness; They do not know over what they stumble. ,20250217
20 My son_ give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. ,20250217
21 Do not let them depart from your sight; Keep them in the midst of your heart. ,20250217
22 For they are life to those who find them And health to all their body. ,20250217
23 Watch over your heart with all diligence_ For from it {flow} the springs of life. ,20250217
24 Put away from you a deceitful mouth And put devious speech far from you. ,20250217
25 Let your eyes look directly ahead And let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you. ,20250217
26 Watch the path of your feet And all your ways will be established. ,20250217
27 Do not turn to the right nor to the left; Turn your foot from evil. ,20250217
1 My son_ give attention to my wisdom_ Incline your ear to my understanding; ,20250217
2 That you may observe discretion And your lips may reserve knowledge. ,20250217
3 For the lips of an adulteress drip honey And smoother than oil is her speech; ,20250217
4 But in the end she is bitter as wormwood_ Sharp as a two-edged sword. ,20250217
5 Her feet go down to death_ Her steps take hold of Sheol. ,20250217
6 She does not ponder the path of life; Her ways are unstable_ she does not know {it.} ,20250217
7 Now then_ {my} sons_ listen to me And do not depart from the words of my mouth. ,20250217
8 Keep your way far from her And do not go near the door of her house_ ,20250217
9 Or you will give your vigor to others And your years to the cruel one; ,20250217
10 And strangers will be filled with your strength And your hard-earned goods {will go} to the house of an alien; ,20250217
11 And you groan at your final end_ When your flesh and your body are consumed; ,20250217
12 And you say_ __How I have hated instruction! And my heart spurned reproof! ,20250217
13 __I have not listened to the voice of my teachers_ Nor inclined my ear to my instructors! ,20250217
14 __I was almost in utter ruin In the midst of the assembly and congregation.__ ,20250217
15 Drink water from your own cistern And fresh water from your own well. ,20250217
16 Should your springs be dispersed abroad_ Streams of water in the streets? ,20250217
17 Let them be yours alone And not for strangers with you. ,20250217
18 Let your fountain be blessed_ And rejoice in the wife of your youth. ,20250217
19 {As} a loving hind and a graceful doe_ Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; Be exhilarated always with her love. ,20250217
20 For why should you_ my son_ be exhilarated with an adulteress And embrace the bosom of a foreigner? ,20250217
21 For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the LORD_ And He watches all his paths. ,20250217
22 His own iniquities will capture the wicked_ And he will be held with the cords of his sin. ,20250217
23 He will die for lack of instruction_ And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray. ,20250217
1 My son_ if you have become surety for your neighbor_ Have given a pledge for a stranger_ ,20250217
2 {If} you have been snared with the words of your mouth_ Have been caught with the words of your mouth_ ,20250217
3 Do this then_ my son_ and deliver yourself; Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor_ Go_ humble yourself_ and importune your neighbor. ,20250217
4 Give no sleep to your eyes_ Nor slumber to your eyelids; ,20250217
5 Deliver yourself like a gazelle from {the hunter's} hand And like a bird from the hand of the fowler. ,20250217
6 Go to the ant_ O sluggard_ Observe her ways and be wise_ ,20250217
7 Which_ having no chief_ Officer or ruler_ ,20250217
8 Prepares her food in the summer {And} gathers her provision in the harvest. ,20250217
9 How long will you lie down_ O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep? ,20250217
10__ A little sleep_ a little slumber_ A little folding of the hands to rest__— ,20250217
11 Your poverty will come in like a vagabond And your need like an armed man. ,20250217
12 A worthless person_ a wicked man_ Is the one who walks with a perverse mouth_ ,20250217
13 Who winks with his eyes_ who signals with his feet_ Who points with his fingers; ,20250217
14 Who {with} perversity in his heart continually devises evil_ Who spreads strife. ,20250217
15 Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; Instantly he will be broken and there will be no healing. ,20250217
16 There are six things which the LORD hates_ Yes_ seven which are an abomination to Him: ,20250217
17 Haughty eyes_ a lying tongue_ And hands that shed innocent blood_ ,20250217
18 A heart that devises wicked plans_ Feet that run rapidly to evil_ ,20250217
19 A false witness {who} utters lies_ And one who spreads strife among brothers. ,20250217
20 My son_ observe the commandment of your father And do not forsake the teaching of your mother; ,20250217
21 Bind them continually on your heart; Tie them around your neck. ,20250217
22 When you walk about_ they will guide you; When you sleep_ they will watch over you; And when you awake_ they will talk to you. ,20250217
23 For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light; And reproofs for discipline are the way of life ,20250217
24 To keep you from the evil woman_ From the smooth tongue of the adulteress. ,20250217
25 Do not desire her beauty in your heart_ Nor let her capture you with her eyelids. ,20250217
26 For on account of a harlot {one is reduced} to a loaf of bread_ And an adulteress hunts for the precious life. ,20250217
27 Can a man take fire in his bosom And his clothes not be burned? ,20250217
28 Or can a man walk on hot coals And his feet not be scorched? ,20250217
29 So is the one who goes in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever touches her will not go unpunished. ,20250217
30 Men do not despise a thief if he steals To satisfy himself when he is hungry; ,20250217
31 But when he is found_ he must repay sevenfold; He must give all the substance of his house. ,20250217
32 The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He who would destroy himself does it. ,20250217
33 Wounds and disgrace he will find_ And his reproach will not be blotted out. ,20250217
34 For jealousy enrages a man_ And he will not spare in the day of vengeance. ,20250217
35 He will not accept any ransom_ Nor will he be satisfied though you give many gifts. ,20250217
1 My son_ keep my words And treasure my commandments within you. ,20250217
2 Keep my commandments and live_ And my teaching as the apple of your eye. ,20250217
3 Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart. ,20250217
4 Say to wisdom_ __You are my sister___ And call understanding {your} intimate friend; ,20250217
5 That they may keep you from an adulteress_ From the foreigner who flatters with her words. ,20250217
6 For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice_ ,20250217
7 And I saw among the naive_ {And} discerned among the youths A young man lacking sense_ ,20250217
8 Passing through the street near her corner; And he takes the way to her house_ ,20250217
9 In the twilight_ in the evening_ In the middle of the night and {in} the darkness. ,20250217
10 And behold_ a woman {comes} to meet him_ Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart. ,20250217
11 She is boisterous and rebellious_ Her feet do not remain at home; ,20250217
12 {She is} now in the streets_ now in the squares_ And lurks by every corner. ,20250217
13 So she seizes him and kisses him And with a brazen face she says to him: ,20250217
14 __I was due to offer peace offerings; Today I have paid my vows. ,20250217
15 __Therefore I have come out to meet you_ To seek your presence earnestly_ and I have found you. ,20250217
16 __I have spread my couch with coverings_ With colored linens of Egypt. ,20250217
17 __I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh_ aloes and cinnamon. ,20250217
18 __Come_ let us drink our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with caresses. ,20250217
19 __For my husband is not at home_ He has gone on a long journey; ,20250217
20 He has taken a bag of money with him_ At the full moon he will come home.__ ,20250217
21 With her many persuasions she entices him; With her flattering lips she seduces him. ,20250217
22 Suddenly he follows her As an ox goes to the slaughter_ Or as {one in} fetters to the discipline of a fool_ ,20250217
23 Until an arrow pierces through his liver; As a bird hastens to the snare_ So he does not know that it {will cost him} his life. ,20250217
24 Now therefore_ {my} sons_ listen to me_ And pay attention to the words of my mouth. ,20250217
25 Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways_ Do not stray into her paths. ,20250217
26 For many are the victims she has cast down_ And numerous are all her slain. ,20250217
27 Her house is the way to Sheol_ Descending to the chambers of death. ,20250217
1 Does not wisdom call_ And understanding lift up her voice? ,20250217
2 On top of the heights beside the way_ Where the paths meet_ she takes her stand; ,20250217
3 Beside the gates_ at the opening to the city_ At the entrance of the doors_ she cries out: ,20250217
4__To you_ O men_ I call_ And my voice is to the sons of men. ,20250217
5 __O naive ones_ understand prudence; And_ O fools_ understand wisdom. ,20250217
6 __Listen_ for I will speak noble things; And the opening of my lips {will reveal} right things. ,20250217
7 __For my mouth will utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips. ,20250217
8 __All the utterances of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverted in them. ,20250217
9 __They are all straightforward to him who understands_ And right to those who find knowledge. ,20250217
10 __Take my instruction and not silver_ And knowledge rather than choicest gold. ,20250217
11 __For wisdom is better than jewels; And all desirable things cannot compare with her. ,20250217
12 __I_ wisdom_ dwell with prudence_ And I find knowledge {and} discretion. ,20250217
13 __The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride and arrogance and the evil way And the perverted mouth_ I hate. ,20250217
14__ Counsel is mine and sound wisdom; I am understanding_ power is mine. ,20250217
15 __By me kings reign_ And rulers decree justice. ,20250217
16 __By me princes rule_ and nobles_ All who judge rightly. ,20250217
17 __I love those who love me; And those who diligently seek me will find me. ,20250217
18 __ Riches and honor are with me_ Enduring wealth and righteousness. ,20250217
19 __My fruit is better than gold_ even pure gold_ And my yield {better} than choicest silver. ,20250217
20 __I walk in the way of righteousness_ In the midst of the paths of justice_ ,20250217
21 To endow those who love me with wealth_ That I may fill their treasuries. ,20250217
22 __The LORD possessed me at the beginning of His way_ Before His works of old. ,20250217
23 __From everlasting I was established_ From the beginning_ from the earliest times of the earth. ,20250217
24 __When there were no depths I was brought forth_ When there were no springs abounding with water. ,20250217
25__ Before the mountains were settled_ Before the hills I was brought forth; ,20250217
26 While He had not yet made the earth and the fields_ Nor the first dust of the world. ,20250217
27 __When He established the heavens_ I was there_ When He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep_ ,20250217
28 When He made firm the skies above_ When the springs of the deep became fixed_ ,20250217
29 When He set for the sea its boundary So that the water would not transgress His command_ When He marked out the foundations of the earth; ,20250217
30 Then I was beside Him_ {as} a master workman; And I was daily {His} delight_ Rejoicing always before Him_ ,20250217
31 Rejoicing in the world_ His earth_ And {having} my delight in the sons of men. ,20250217
32 __Now therefore_ {O} sons_ listen to me_ For blessed are they who keep my ways. ,20250217
33 __ Heed instruction and be wise_ And do not neglect {it.} ,20250217
34__ Blessed is the man who listens to me_ Watching daily at my gates_ Waiting at my doorposts. ,20250217
35 __For he who finds me finds life And obtains favor from the LORD. ,20250217
36 __But he who sins against me injures himself; All those who hate me love death.__ ,20250217
1 Wisdom has built her house_ She has hewn out her seven pillars; ,20250217
2 She has prepared her food_ she has mixed her wine; She has also set her table; ,20250217
3 She has sent out her maidens_ she calls From the tops of the heights of the city: ,20250217
4__ Whoever is naive_ let him turn in here!__ To him who lacks understanding she says_ ,20250217
5 __Come_ eat of my food And drink of the wine I have mixed. ,20250217
6 __Forsake {your} folly and live_ And proceed in the way of understanding.__ ,20250217
7 He who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself_ And he who reproves a wicked man {gets} insults for himself. ,20250217
8 Do not reprove a scoffer_ or he will hate you_ Reprove a wise man and he will love you. ,20250217
9 Give {instruction} to a wise man and he will be still wiser_ Teach a righteous man and he will increase {his} learning. ,20250217
10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom_ And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. ,20250217
11 For by me your days will be multiplied_ And years of life will be added to you. ,20250217
12 If you are wise_ you are wise for yourself_ And if you scoff_ you alone will bear it. ,20250217
13 The woman of folly is boisterous_ {She is} naive and knows nothing. ,20250217
14 She sits at the doorway of her house_ On a seat by the high places of the city_ ,20250217
15 Calling to those who pass by_ Who are making their paths straight: ,20250217
16 __ Whoever is naive_ let him turn in here___ And to him who lacks understanding she says_ ,20250217

22 {As} a ring of gold in a swine's snout {So is} a beautiful woman who lacks discretion. ,20250217
23 The desire of the righteous is only good_ {But} the expectation of the wicked is wrath. ,20250217

23 In all labor there is profit_ But mere talk {leads} only to poverty. ,20250217
24 The crown of the wise is their riches_ {But} the folly of fools is foolishness. ,20250217
25 A truthful witness saves lives_ But he who utters lies is treacherous. ,20250217
26 In the fear of the LORD there is strong confidence_ And his children will have refuge. ,20250217
27 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life_ That one may avoid the snares of death. ,20250217
28 In a multitude of people is a king's glory_ But in the dearth of people is a prince's ruin. ,20250217
29 He who is slow to anger has great understanding_ But he who is quick-tempered exalts folly. ,20250217

16 Better is a little with the fear of the LORD Than great treasure and turmoil with it. ,20250217
17 Better is a dish of vegetables where love is Than a fattened ox {served} with hatred. ,20250217
18 A hot-tempered man stirs up strife_ But the slow to anger calms a dispute. ,20250217
19 The way of the lazy is as a hedge of thorns_ But the path of the upright is a highway. ,20250217
20 A wise son makes a father glad_ But a foolish man despises his mother. ,20250217
21 Folly is joy to him who lacks sense_ But a man of understanding walks straight. ,20250217
22 Without consultation_ plans are frustrated_ But with many counselors they succeed. ,20250217
23 A man has joy in an apt answer_ And how delightful is a timely word! ,20250217
24 The path of life {leads} upward for the wise That he may keep away from Sheol below. ,20250217
25 The LORD will tear down the house of the proud_ But He will establish the boundary of the widow. ,20250217

27 He who profits illicitly troubles his own house_ But he who hates bribes will live. ,20250217
28 The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer_ But the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things. ,20250217
29 The LORD is far from the wicked_ But He hears the prayer of the righteous. ,20250217
30 Bright eyes gladden the heart; Good news puts fat on the bones. ,20250217
31 He whose ear listens to the life-giving reproof Will dwell among the wise. ,20250217
32 He who neglects discipline despises himself_ But he who listens to reproof acquires understanding. ,20250217
33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction for wisdom_ And before honor {comes} humility. ,20250217
1 The plans of the heart belong to man_ But the answer of the tongue is from the LORD. ,20250217
2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own sight_ But the LORD weighs the motives. ,20250217
3 Commit your works to the LORD And your plans will be established. ,20250217
4 The LORD has made everything for its own purpose_ Even the wicked for the day of evil. ,20250217
5 Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD; Assuredly_ he will not be unpunished. ,20250217
6 By lovingkindness and truth iniquity is atoned for_ And by the fear of the LORD one keeps away from evil. ,20250217
7 When a man's ways are pleasing to the LORD_ He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. ,20250217
8 Better is a little with righteousness Than great income with injustice. ,20250217
9 The mind of man plans his way_ But the LORD directs his steps. ,20250217
10 A divine decision is in the lips of the king; His mouth should not err in judgment. ,20250217
11 A just balance and scales belong to the LORD; All the weights of the bag are His concern. ,20250217
12 It is an abomination for kings to commit wicked acts_ For a throne is established on righteousness. ,20250217
13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings_ And he who speaks right is loved. ,20250217
14 The fury of a king is {like} messengers of death_ But a wise man will appease it. ,20250217
15 In the light of a king's face is life_ And his favor is like a cloud with the spring rain. ,20250217
16 How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen above silver. ,20250217
17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; He who watches his way preserves his life. ,20250217
18 Pride {goes} before destruction_ And a haughty spirit before stumbling. ,20250217
19 It is better to be humble in spirit with the lowly Than to divide the spoil with the proud. ,20250217
20 He who gives attention to the word will find good_ And blessed is he who trusts in the LORD. ,20250217
21 The wise in heart will be called understanding_ And sweetness of speech increases persuasiveness. ,20250217
22 Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it_ But the discipline of fools is folly. ,20250217
23 The heart of the wise instructs his mouth And adds persuasiveness to his lips. ,20250217
24 Pleasant words are a honeycomb_ Sweet to the soul and healing to the bones. ,20250217
25 There is a way {which seems} right to a man_ But its end is the way of death. ,20250217
26 A worker's appetite works for him_ For his hunger urges him {on.} ,20250217
27 A worthless man digs up evil_ While his words are like scorching fire. ,20250217
28 A perverse man spreads strife_ And a slanderer separates intimate friends. ,20250217
29 A man of violence entices his neighbor And leads him in a way that is not good. ,20250217
30 He who winks his eyes {does so} to devise perverse things; He who compresses his lips brings evil to pass. ,20250217
31 A gray head is a crown of glory; It is found in the way of righteousness. ,20250217
32 He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty_ And he who rules his spirit_ than he who captures a city. ,20250217
33 The lot is cast into the lap_ But its every decision is from the LORD. ,20250217
1 Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it Than a house full of feasting with strife. ,20250217
2 A servant who acts wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully_ And will share in the inheritance among brothers. ,20250217
3 The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold_ But the LORD tests hearts. ,20250217
4 An evildoer listens to wicked lips; A liar pays attention to a destructive tongue. ,20250217
5 He who mocks the poor taunts his Maker; He who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished. ,20250217
6 Grandchildren are the crown of old men_ And the glory of sons is their fathers. ,20250217
7 Excellent speech is not fitting for a fool_ Much less are lying lips to a prince. ,20250217
8 A bribe is a charm in the sight of its owner; Wherever he turns_ he prospers. ,20250217
9 He who conceals a transgression seeks love_ But he who repeats a matter separates intimate friends. ,20250217
10 A rebuke goes deeper into one who has understanding Than a hundred blows into a fool. ,20250217
11 A rebellious man seeks only evil_ So a cruel messenger will be sent against him. ,20250217
12 Let a man meet a bear robbed of her cubs_ Rather than a fool in his folly. ,20250217
13 He who returns evil for good_ Evil will not depart from his house. ,20250217
14 The beginning of strife is {like} letting out water_ So abandon the quarrel before it breaks out. ,20250217
15 He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous_ Both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD. ,20250217
16 Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom_ When he has no sense? ,20250217
17 A friend loves at all times_ And a brother is born for adversity. ,20250217
18 A man lacking in sense pledges And becomes guarantor in the presence of his neighbor. ,20250217
19 He who loves transgression loves strife; He who raises his door seeks destruction. ,20250217
20 He who has a crooked mind finds no good_ And he who is perverted in his language falls into evil. ,20250217
21 He who sires a fool {does so} to his sorrow_ And the father of a fool has no joy. ,20250217
22 A joyful heart is good medicine_ But a broken spirit dries up the bones. ,20250217
23 A wicked man receives a bribe from the bosom To pervert the ways of justice. ,20250217
24 Wisdom is in the presence of the one who has understanding_ But the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth. ,20250217
25 A foolish son is a grief to his father And bitterness to her who bore him. ,20250217
26 It is also not good to fine the righteous_ {Nor} to strike the noble for {their} uprightness. ,20250217
27 He who restrains his words has nowledge_ And he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding. ,20250217
28 Even a fool_ when he keeps silent_ is considered wise; When he closes his lips_ he is {considered} prudent. ,20250217
1 He who separates himself seeks {his own} desire_ He quarrels against all sound wisdom. ,20250217
2 A fool does not delight in understanding_ But only in revealing his own mind. ,20250217
3 When a wicked man comes_ contempt also comes_ And with dishonor {comes} scorn. ,20250217
4 The words of a man's mouth are deep waters; The fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook. ,20250217
5 To show partiality to the wicked is not good_ {Nor} to thrust aside the righteous in judgment. ,20250217
6 A fool's lips bring strife_ And his mouth calls for blows. ,20250217
7 A fool's mouth is his ruin_ And his lips are the snare of his soul. ,20250217
8 The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels_ And they go down into the innermost parts of the body. ,20250217
9 He also who is slack in his work Is brother to him who destroys. ,20250217
10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous runs into it and is safe. ,20250217
11 A rich man's wealth is his strong city_ And like a high wall in his own imagination. ,20250217
12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty_ But humility {goes} before honor. ,20250217
13 He who gives an answer before he hears_ It is folly and shame to him. ,20250217
14 The spirit of a man can endure his sickness_ But {as for} a broken spirit who can bear it? ,20250217
15 The mind of the prudent acquires knowledge_ And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge. ,20250217
16 A man's gift makes room for him And brings him before great men. ,20250217
17 The first to plead his case {seems} right_ {Until} another comes and examines him. ,20250217
18 The {cast} lot puts an end to strife And decides between the mighty ones. ,20250217
19 A brother offended {is harder to be won} than a strong city_ And contentions are like the bars of a citadel. ,20250217
20 With the fruit of a man's mouth his stomach will be satisfied; He will be satisfied {with} the product of his lips. ,20250217
21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue_ And those who love it will eat its fruit. ,20250217
22 He who finds a wife finds a good thing And obtains favor from the LORD. ,20250217
23 The poor man utters supplications_ But the rich man answers roughly. ,20250217
24 A man of {too many} friends {comes} to ruin_ But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. ,20250217
1 Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity Than he who is perverse in speech and is a fool. ,20250217
2 Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge_ And he who hurries his footsteps errs. ,20250217
3 The foolishness of man ruins his way_ And his heart rages against the LORD. ,20250217
4 Wealth adds many friends_ But a poor man is separated from his friend. ,20250217
5 A false witness will not go unpunished_ And he who tells lies will not escape. ,20250217
6 Many will seek the favor of a generous man_ And every man is a friend to him who gives gifts. ,20250217
7 All the brothers of a poor man hate him; How much more do his friends abandon him! He pursues {them with} words_ {but} they are gone. ,20250217
8 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; He who keeps understanding will find good. ,20250217
9 A false witness will not go unpunished_ And he who tells lies will perish. ,20250217
10 Luxury is not fitting for a fool; Much less for a slave to rule over princes. ,20250217
11 A man's discretion makes him slow to anger_ And it is his glory to overlook a transgression. ,20250217
12 The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion_ But his favor is like dew on the grass. ,20250217
13 A foolish son is destruction to his father_ And the contentions of a wife are a constant dripping. ,20250217
14 House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers_ But a prudent wife is from the LORD. ,20250217
15 Laziness casts into a deep sleep_ And an idle man will suffer hunger. ,20250217
16 He who keeps he commandment keeps his soul_ {But} he who is careless of conduct will die. ,20250217
17 One who is gracious to a poor man lends to the LORD_ And He will repay him for his good deed. ,20250217
18 Discipline your son while there is hope_ And do not desire his death. ,20250217
19 {A man of} great anger will bear the penalty_ For if you rescue {him_} you will only have to do it again. ,20250217
20 Listen to counsel and accept discipline_ That you may be wise the rest of your days. ,20250217
21 Many plans are in a man's heart_ But the counsel of the LORD will stand. ,20250217
22 What is desirable in a man is his kindness_ And {it is} better to be a poor man than a liar. ,20250217
23 The fear of the LORD {leads} to life_ So that one may sleep satisfied_ untouched by evil. ,20250217
24 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish_ {But} will not even bring it back to his mouth. ,20250217
25 Strike a scoffer and the naive may become shrewd_ But reprove one who has understanding and he will gain knowledge. ,20250217
26 He who assaults {his} father {and} drives {his} mother away Is a shameful and disgraceful son. ,20250217
27 Cease listening_ my son_ to discipline_ {And you will} stray from the words of knowledge. ,20250217
28 A rascally witness makes a mockery of justice_ And the mouth of the wicked spreads iniquity. ,20250217
29 Judgments are prepared for scoffers_ And blows for the back of fools. ,20250217
1 Wine is a mocker_ strong drink a brawler_ And whoever is intoxicated by it is not wise. ,20250217
2 The terror of a king is like the growling of a lion; He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life. ,20250217
3 Keeping away from strife is an honor for a man_ But any fool will quarrel. ,20250217
4 The sluggard does not plow after the autumn_ So he begs during the harvest and has nothing. ,20250217
5 A plan in the heart of a man is {like} deep water_ But a man of understanding draws it out. ,20250217
6 Many a man proclaims his own loyalty_ But who can find a trustworthy man? ,20250217
7 A righteous man who walks in his integrity-- How blessed are his sons after him. ,20250217
8 A king who sits on the throne of justice Disperses all evil with his eyes. ,20250217
9 Who can say_ __I have cleansed my heart_ I am pure from my sin__? ,20250217
10 Differing weights and differing measures_ Both of them are abominable to the LORD. ,20250217
11 It is by his deeds that a lad distinguishes himself If his conduct is pure and right. ,20250217
12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye_ The LORD has made both of them. ,20250217
13 Do not love sleep_ or you will become poor; Open your eyes_ {and} you will be satisfied with food. ,20250217
14 __Bad_ bad___ says the buyer_ But when he goes his way_ then he boasts. ,20250217
15 There is gold_ and an abundance of jewels; But the lips of knowledge are a more precious thing. ,20250217
16 Take his garment when he becomes surety for a stranger; And for foreigners_ hold him in pledge. ,20250217
17 Bread obtained by falsehood is sweet to a man_ But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel. ,20250217
18 Prepare plans by consultation_ And make war by wise guidance. ,20250217
19 He who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets_ Therefore do not associate with a gossip. ,20250217
20 He who curses his father or his mother_ His lamp will go out in time of darkness. ,20250217
21 An inheritance gained hurriedly at the beginning Will not be blessed in the end. ,20250217
22 Do not say_ __I will repay evil__; Wait for the LORD_ and He will save you. ,20250217
23 Differing weights are an abomination to the LORD_ And a false scale is not good. ,20250217
24 Man's steps are {ordained} by the LORD_ How then can man understand his way? ,20250217
25 It is a trap for a man to say rashly_ __It is holy!__ And after the vows to make inquiry. ,20250217
26 A wise king winnows the wicked_ And drives the {threshing} wheel over them. ,20250217
27 The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD_ Searching all the innermost parts of his being. ,20250217
28 Loyalty and truth preserve the king_ And he upholds his throne by righteousness. ,20250217
29 The glory of young men is their strength_ And the honor of old men is their gray hair. ,20250217
30 Stripes that wound scour away evil_ And strokes {reach} the innermost parts. ,20250217
1 The king's heart is {like} channels of water in the hand of the LORD; He turns it wherever He wishes. ,20250217
2 Every man's way is right in his own eyes_ But the LORD weighs the hearts. ,20250217
3 To do righteousness and justice Is desired by the LORD more than sacrifice. ,20250217
4 Haughty eyes and a proud heart_ The lamp of the wicked_ is sin. ,20250217
5 The plans of the diligent {lead} surely to advantage_ But everyone who is hasty {comes} surely to poverty. ,20250217
6 The acquisition of treasures by a lying tongue Is a fleeting vapor_ the pursuit of death. ,20250217
7 The violence of the wicked will drag them away_ Because they refuse to act with justice. ,20250217
8 The way of a guilty man is crooked_ But as for the pure_ his conduct is upright. ,20250217
9 It is better to live in a corner of a roof Than in a house shared with a contentious woman. ,20250217
10 The soul of the wicked desires evil; His neighbor finds no favor in his eyes. ,20250217
11 When the scoffer is punished_ the naive becomes wise; But when the wise is instructed_ he receives knowledge. ,20250217
12 The righteous one considers the house of the wicked_ Turning the wicked to ruin. ,20250217
13 He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor Will also cry himself and not be answered. ,20250217
14 A gift in secret subdues anger_ And a bribe in the bosom_ strong wrath. ,20250217
15 The exercise of justice is joy for the righteous_ But is terror to the workers of iniquity. ,20250217
16 A man who wanders from the way of understanding Will rest in the assembly of the dead. ,20250217
17 He who loves pleasure {will become} a poor man; He who loves wine and oil will not become rich. ,20250217
18 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous_ And the treacherous is in the place of the upright. ,20250217
19 It is better to live in a desert land Than with a contentious and vexing woman. ,20250217
20 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise_ But a foolish man swallows it up. ,20250217
21 He who pursues righteousness and loyalty Finds life_ righteousness and honor. ,20250217
22 A wise man scales the city of the mighty And brings down the stronghold in which they trust. ,20250217
23 He who guards his mouth and his tongue_ Guards his soul from troubles. ,20250217
24 __Proud___ __Haughty___ __ Scoffer___ are his names_ Who acts with insolent pride. ,20250217
25 The desire of the sluggard puts him to death_ For his hands refuse to work; ,20250217
26 All day long he is craving_ While the righteous gives and does not hold back. ,20250217
27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination_ How much more when he brings it with evil intent! ,20250217
28 A false witness will perish_ But the man who listens {to the truth} will speak forever. ,20250217
29 A wicked man displays a bold face_ But as for the upright_ he makes his way sure. ,20250217
30 There is no wisdom and no understanding And no counsel against the LORD. ,20250217
31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle_ But victory belongs to the LORD. ,20250217
1 A {good} name is to be more desired than great wealth_ Favor is better than silver and gold. ,20250217
2 The rich and the poor have a common bond_ The LORD is the maker of them all. ,20250217
3 The prudent sees the evil and hides himself_ But the naive go on_ and are punished for it. ,20250217
4 The reward of humility {and} the fear of the LORD Are riches_ honor and life. ,20250217
5 Thorns {and} snares are in the way of the perverse; He who guards himself will be far from them. ,20250217
6 Train up a child in the way he should go_ Even when he is old he will not depart from it. ,20250217
7 The rich rules over the poor_ And the borrower {becomes} the lender's slave. ,20250217
8 He who sows iniquity will reap vanity_ And the rod of his fury will perish. ,20250217
9 He who is generous will be blessed_ For he gives some of his food to the poor. ,20250217
10 Drive out the scoffer_ and contention will go out_ Even strife and dishonor will cease. ,20250217
11 He who loves purity of heart {And} whose speech is gracious_ the king is his friend. ,20250217
12 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge_ But He overthrows the words of the treacherous man. ,20250217
13 The sluggard says_ __There is a lion outside; I will be killed in the streets!__ ,20250217
14 The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit; He who is cursed of the LORD will fall into it. ,20250217
15 Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; The rod of discipline will remove it far from him. ,20250217
16 He who oppresses the poor to make more for himself Or who gives to the rich_ {will} only {come to} poverty. ,20250217
17 Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise_ And apply your mind to my knowledge; ,20250217
18 For it will be pleasant if you keep them within you_ That they may be ready on your lips. ,20250217
19 So that your trust may be in the LORD_ I have taught you today_ even you. ,20250217
20 Have I not written to you excellent things Of counsels and knowledge_ ,20250217
21 To make you know the certainty of the words of truth That you may correctly answer him who sent you? ,20250217
22 Do not rob the poor because he is poor_ Or crush the afflicted at the gate; ,20250217
23 For the LORD will plead their case And take the life of those who rob them. ,20250217
24 Do not associate with a man {given} to anger; Or go with a hot-tempered man_ ,20250217
25 Or you will learn his ways And find a snare for yourself. ,20250217
26 Do not be among those who give pledges_ Among those who become guarantors for debts. ,20250217
27 If you have nothing with which to pay_ Why should he take your bed from under you? ,20250217
28 Do not move the ancient boundary Which your fathers have set. ,20250217
29 Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings; He will not stand before obscure men. ,20250217
1 When you sit down to dine with a ruler_ Consider carefully what is before you_ ,20250217
2 And put a knife to your throat If you are a man of {great} appetite. ,20250217
3 Do not desire his delicacies_ For it is deceptive food. ,20250217
4 Do not weary yourself to gain wealth_ Cease from your consideration {of it.} ,20250217
5 When you set your eyes on it_ it is gone. For {wealth} certainly makes itself wings Like an eagle that flies {toward} the heavens. ,20250217
6 Do not eat the bread of a selfish man_ Or desire his delicacies; ,20250217
7 For as he thinks within himself_ so he is. He says to you_ __Eat and drink!__ But his heart is not with you. ,20250217
8 You will vomit up the morsel you have eaten_ And waste your compliments. ,20250217
9 Do not speak in the hearing of a fool_ For he will despise the wisdom of your words. ,20250217
10 Do not move the ancient boundary Or go into the fields of the fatherless_ ,20250217
11 For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their case against you. ,20250217
12 Apply your heart to discipline And your ears to words of knowledge. ,20250217
13 Do not hold back discipline from the child_ Although you strike him with the rod_ he will not die. ,20250217
14 You shall strike him with the rod And rescue his soul from Sheol. ,20250217
15 My son_ if your heart is wise_ My own heart also will be glad; ,20250217
16 And my inmost being will rejoice When your lips speak what is right. ,20250217
17 Do not let your heart envy sinners_ But {live} in the fear of the LORD always. ,20250217
18 Surely there is a future_ And your hope will not be cut off. ,20250217
19 Listen_ my son_ and be wise_ And direct your heart in the way. ,20250217
20 Do not be with heavy drinkers of wine_ {Or} with gluttonous eaters of meat; ,20250217
21 For the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty_ And drowsiness will clothe {one} with rags. ,20250217
22 Listen to your father who begot you_ And do not despise your mother when she is old. ,20250217
23 Buy truth_ and do not sell {it_} {Get} wisdom and instruction and understanding. ,20250217
24 The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice_ And he who sires a wise son will be glad in him. ,20250217
25 Let your father and your mother be glad_ And let her rejoice who gave birth to you. ,20250217
26 Give me your heart_ my son_ And let your eyes delight in my ways. ,20250217
27 For a harlot is a deep pit And an adulterous woman is a narrow well. ,20250217
28 Surely she lurks as a robber_ And increases the faithless among men. ,20250217
29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? ,20250217
30 Those who linger long over wine_ Those who go to taste mixed wine. ,20250217
31 Do not look on the wine when it is red_ When it sparkles in the cup_ When it goes down smoothly; ,20250217
32 At the last it bites like a serpent And stings like a viper. ,20250217
33 Your eyes will see strange things And your mind will utter perverse things. ,20250217
34 And you will be like one who lies down in the middle of the sea_ Or like one who lies down on the top of a mast. ,20250217
35 __They struck me_ {but} I did not become ill; They beat me_ {but} I did not know {it.} When shall I awake? I will seek another drink.__ ,20250217
1 Do not be envious of evil men_ Nor desire to be with them; ,20250217
2 For their minds devise violence_ And their lips talk of trouble. ,20250217
3 By wisdom a house is built_ And by understanding it is established; ,20250217
4 And by knowledge the rooms are filled With all precious and pleasant riches. ,20250217
5 A wise man is strong_ And a man of knowledge increases power. ,20250217
6 For by wise guidance you will wage war_ And in abundance of counselors there is victory. ,20250217
7 Wisdom is {too} exalted for a fool_ He does not open his mouth in the gate. ,20250217
8 One who plans to do evil_ Men will call a schemer. ,20250217
9 The devising of folly is sin_ And the scoffer is an abomination to men. ,20250217
10 If you are slack in the day of distress_ Your strength is limited. ,20250217
11 Deliver those who are being taken away to death_ And those who are staggering to slaughter_ Oh hold {them} back. ,20250217
12 If you say_ __See_ we did not know this___ Does He not consider {it} who weighs the hearts? And does He not know {it} who keeps your soul? And will He not render to man according to his work? ,20250217
13 My son_ eat honey_ for it is good_ Yes_ the honey from the comb is sweet to your taste; ,20250217
14 Know {that} wisdom is thus for your soul; If you find {it_} then there will be a future_ And your hope will not be cut off. ,20250217
15 Do not lie in wait_ O wicked man_ against the dwelling of the righteous; Do not destroy his resting place; ,20250217
16 For a righteous man falls seven times_ and rises again_ But the wicked stumble in {time of} calamity. ,20250217
17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls_ And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles; ,20250217
18 Or the LORD will see {it} and be displeased_ And turn His anger away from him. ,20250217
19 Do not fret because of evildoers Or be envious of the wicked; ,20250217
20 For there will be no future for the evil man; The lamp of the wicked will be put out. ,20250217
21 My son_ fear the LORD and the king; Do not associate with those who are given to change_ ,20250217
22 For their calamity will rise suddenly_ And who knows the ruin {that comes} from both of them? ,20250217
23 These also are sayings of the wise. To show partiality in judgment is not good. ,20250217
24 He who says to the wicked_ __You are righteous___ Peoples will curse him_ nations will abhor him; ,20250217
25 But to those who rebuke the {wicked} will be delight_ And a good blessing will come upon them. ,20250217
26 He kisses the lips Who gives a right answer. ,20250217
27 Prepare your work outside And make it ready for yourself in the field; Afterwards_ then_ build your house. ,20250217
28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause_ And do not deceive with your lips. ,20250217
29 Do not say_ __Thus I shall do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work.__ ,20250217
30 I passed by the field of the sluggard And by the vineyard of the man lacking sense_ ,20250217
31 And behold_ it was completely overgrown with thistles; Its surface was covered with nettles_ And its stone wall was broken down. ,20250217
32 When I saw_ I reflected upon it; I looked_ {and} received instruction. ,20250217
33 __ A little sleep_ a little slumber_ A little folding of the hands to rest___ ,20250217
34 Then your poverty will come {as} a robber And your want like an armed man. ,20250217
1 These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah_ king of Judah_ transcribed. ,20250217
2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter_ But the glory of kings is to search out a matter. ,20250217
3 {As} the heavens for height and the earth for depth_ So the heart of kings is unsearchable. ,20250217
4 Take away the dross from the silver_ And there comes out a vessel for the smith; ,20250217
5 Take away the wicked before the king_ And his throne will be established in righteousness. ,20250217
6 Do not claim honor in the presence of the king_ And do not stand in the place of great men; ,20250217
7 For it is better that it be said to you_ __Come up here___ Than for you to be placed lower in the presence of the prince_ Whom your eyes have seen. ,20250217
8 Do not go out hastily to argue {your case;} Otherwise_ what will you do in the end_ When your neighbor humiliates you? ,20250217
9 Argue your case with your neighbor_ And do not reveal the secret of another_ ,20250217
10 Or he who hears {it} will reproach you_ And the evil report about you will not pass away. ,20250217
11 {Like} apples of gold in settings of silver Is a word spoken in right circumstances. ,20250217
12 {Like} an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold Is a wise reprover to a listening ear. ,20250217
13 Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest Is a faithful messenger to those who send him_ For he refreshes the soul of his masters. ,20250217
14 {Like} clouds and wind without rain Is a man who boasts of his gifts falsely. ,20250217
15 By forbearance a ruler may be persuaded_ And a soft tongue breaks the bone. ,20250217
16 Have you found honey? Eat {only} what you need_ That you not have it in excess and vomit it. ,20250217
17 Let your foot rarely be in your neighbor's house_ Or he will become weary of you and hate you. ,20250217
18 {Like} a club and a sword and a sharp arrow Is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor. ,20250217
19 {Like} a bad tooth and an unsteady foot Is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble. ,20250217
20 {Like} one who takes off a garment on a cold day_ {or like} vinegar on soda_ Is he who sings songs to a troubled heart. ,20250217
21 If your enemy is hungry_ give him food to eat; And if he is thirsty_ give him water to drink; ,20250217
22 For you will heap burning coals on his head_ And the LORD will reward you. ,20250217
23 The north wind brings forth rain_ And a backbiting tongue_ an angry countenance. ,20250217
24 It is better to live in a corner of the roof Than in a house shared with a contentious woman. ,20250217
25 {Like} cold water to a weary soul_ So is good news from a distant land. ,20250217
26 {Like} a trampled spring and a polluted well Is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked. ,20250217
27 It is not good to eat much honey_ Nor is it glory to search out one's own glory. ,20250217
28 {Like} a city that is broken into {and} without walls Is a man who has no control over his spirit. ,20250217
1 Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest_ So honor is not fitting for a fool. ,20250217
2 Like a sparrow in {its} flitting_ like a swallow in {its} flying_ So a curse without cause does not alight. ,20250217
3 A whip is for the horse_ a bridle for the donkey_ And a rod for the back of fools. ,20250217
4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly_ Or you will also be like him. ,20250217
5 Answer a fool as his folly {deserves_} That he not be wise in his own eyes. ,20250217
6 He cuts off {his own} feet {and} drinks violence Who sends a message by the hand of a fool. ,20250217
7 {Like} the legs {which} are useless to the lame_ So is a proverb in the mouth of fools. ,20250217
8 Like one who binds a stone in a sling_ So is he who gives honor to a fool. ,20250217
9 {Like} a thorn {which} falls into the hand of a drunkard_ So is a proverb in the mouth of fools. ,20250217
10 {Like} an archer who wounds everyone_ So is he who hires a fool or who hires those who pass by. ,20250217
11 Like a dog that returns to its vomit Is a fool who repeats his folly. ,20250217
12 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him. ,20250217
13 The sluggard says_ __There is a lion in the road! A lion is in the open square!__ ,20250217
14 {As} the door turns on its hinges_ So {does} the sluggard on his bed. ,20250217
15 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; He is weary of bringing it to his mouth again. ,20250217
16 The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes Than seven men who can give a discreet answer. ,20250217
17 {Like} one who takes a dog by the ears Is he who passes by {and} meddles with strife not belonging to him. ,20250217
18 Like a madman who throws Firebrands_ arrows and death_ ,20250217
19 So is the man who deceives his neighbor_ And says_ __ Was I not joking?__ ,20250217
20 For lack of wood the fire goes out_ And where there is no whisperer_ contention quiets down. ,20250217
21 {Like} charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire_ So is a contentious man to kindle strife. ,20250217
22 The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels_ And they go down into the innermost parts of the body. ,20250217
23 {Like} an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross Are burning lips and a wicked heart. ,20250217
24 He who hates disguises {it} with his lips_ But he lays up deceit in his heart. ,20250217
25 When he speaks graciously_ do not believe him_ For there are seven abominations in his heart. ,20250217
26 {Though his} hatred covers itself with guile_ His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly. ,20250217
27 He who digs a pit will fall into it_ And he who rolls a stone_ it will come back on him. ,20250217
28 A lying tongue hates those it crushes_ And a flattering mouth works ruin. ,20250217
1 Do not boast about tomorrow_ For you do not know what a day may bring forth. ,20250217
2 Let another praise you_ and not your own mouth; A stranger_ and not your own lips. ,20250217
3 A stone is heavy and the sand weighty_ But the provocation of a fool is heavier than both of them. ,20250217
4 Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood_ But who can stand before jealousy? ,20250217
5 Better is open rebuke Than love that is concealed. ,20250217
6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend_ But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy. ,20250217
7 A sated man loathes honey_ But to a famished man any bitter thing is sweet. ,20250217
8 Like a bird that wanders from her nest_ So is a man who wanders from his home. ,20250217
9 Oil and perfume make the heart glad_ So a man's counsel is sweet to his friend. ,20250217
10 Do not forsake your own friend or your father's friend_ And do not go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity; Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far away. ,20250217
11 Be wise_ my son_ and make my heart glad_ That I may reply to him who reproaches me. ,20250217
12 A prudent man sees evil {and} hides himself_ The naive proceed {and} pay the penalty. ,20250217
13 Take his garment when he becomes surety for a stranger; And for an adulterous woman hold him in pledge. ,20250217
14 He who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning_ It will be reckoned a curse to him. ,20250217
15 A constant dripping on a day of steady rain And a contentious woman are alike; ,20250217
16 He who would restrain her restrains the wind_ And grasps oil with his right hand. ,20250217
17 Iron sharpens iron_ So one man sharpens another. ,20250217
18 He who tends the fig tree will eat its fruit_ And he who cares for his master will be honored. ,20250217
19 As in water face {reflects} face_ So the heart of man {reflects} man. ,20250217
20 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied_ Nor are the eyes of man ever satisfied. ,20250217
21 The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold_ And each {is tested} by the praise accorded him. ,20250217
22 Though you pound a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain_ {Yet} his foolishness will not depart from him. ,20250217
23 Know well the condition of your flocks_ {And} pay attention to your herds; ,20250217
24 For riches are not forever_ Nor does a crown {endure} to all generations. ,20250217
25 {When} the grass disappears_ the new growth is seen_ And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in_ ,20250217
26 The lambs {will be} for your clothing_ And the goats {will bring} the price of a field_ ,20250217
27 And {there will be} goats' milk enough for your food_ For the food of your household_ And sustenance for your maidens. ,20250217
1 The wicked flee when no one is pursuing_ But the righteous are bold as a lion. ,20250217
2 By the transgression of a land many are its princes_ But by a man of understanding {and} knowledge_ so it endures. ,20250217
3 A poor man who oppresses the lowly Is {like} a driving rain which leaves no food. ,20250217
4 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked_ But those who keep the law strive with them. ,20250217
5 Evil men do not understand justice_ But those who seek the LORD understand all things. ,20250217
6 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity Than he who is crooked though he be rich. ,20250217
7 He who keeps the law is a discerning son_ But he who is a companion of gluttons humiliates his father. ,20250217
8 He who increases his wealth by interest and usury Gathers it for him who is gracious to the poor. ,20250217
9 He who turns away his ear from listening to the law_ Even his prayer is an abomination. ,20250217
10 He who leads the upright astray in an evil way Will himself fall into his own pit_ But the blameless will inherit good. ,20250217
11 The rich man is wise in his own eyes_ But the poor who has understanding sees through him. ,20250217
12 When the righteous triumph_ there is great glory_ But when the wicked rise_ men hide themselves. ,20250217
13 He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper_ But he who confesses and forsakes {them} will find compassion. ,20250217
14 How blessed is the man who fears always_ But he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity. ,20250217
15 {Like} a roaring lion and a rushing bear Is a wicked ruler over a poor people. ,20250217
16 A leader who is a great oppressor lacks understanding_ {But} he who hates unjust gain will prolong {his} days. ,20250217
17 A man who is laden with the guilt of human blood Will be a fugitive until death; let no one support him. ,20250217
18 He who walks blamelessly will be delivered_ But he who is crooked will fall all at once. ,20250217
19 He who tills his land will have plenty of food_ But he who follows empty {pursuits} will have poverty in plenty. ,20250217
20 A faithful man will abound with blessings_ But he who makes haste to be rich will not go unpunished. ,20250217
21 To show partiality is not good_ Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress. ,20250217
22 A man with an evil eye hastens after wealth And does not know that want will come upon him. ,20250217
23 He who rebukes a man will afterward find {more} favor Than he who flatters with the tongue. ,20250217
24 He who robs his father or his mother And says_ __It is not a transgression___ Is the companion of a man who destroys. ,20250217
25 An arrogant man stirs up strife_ But he who trusts in the LORD will prosper. ,20250217
26 He who trusts in his own heart is a fool_ But he who walks wisely will be delivered. ,20250217
27 He who gives to the poor will never want_ But he who shuts his eyes will have many curses. ,20250217
28 When the wicked rise_ men hide themselves; But when they perish_ the righteous increase. ,20250217
1 A man who hardens {his} neck after much reproof Will suddenly be broken beyond remedy. ,20250217
2 When the righteous increase_ the people rejoice_ But when a wicked man rules_ people groan. ,20250217
3 A man who loves wisdom makes his father glad_ But he who keeps company with harlots wastes {his} wealth. ,20250217
4 The king gives stability to the land by justice_ But a man who takes bribes overthrows it. ,20250217
5 A man who flatters his neighbor Is spreading a net for his steps. ,20250217
6 By transgression an evil man is ensnared_ But the righteous sings and rejoices. ,20250217
7 The righteous is concerned for the rights of the poor_ The wicked does not understand {such} concern. ,20250217
8 Scorners set a city aflame_ But wise men turn away anger. ,20250217
9 When a wise man has a controversy with a foolish man_ The foolish man either rages or laughs_ and there is no rest. ,20250217
10 Men of bloodshed hate the blameless_ But the upright are concerned for his life. ,20250217
11 A fool always loses his temper_ But a wise man holds it back. ,20250217
12 If aruler pays attention to falsehood_ All his ministers {become} wicked. ,20250217
13 The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: The LORD gives light to the eyes of both. ,20250217
14 If a king judges the poor with truth_ His throne will be established forever. ,20250217
15 The rod and reproof give wisdom_ But a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother. ,20250217
16 When the wicked increase_ transgression increases; But the righteous will see their fall. ,20250217
17 Correct your son_ and he will give you comfort; He will also delight your soul. ,20250217
18 Where there is no vision_ the people are unrestrained_ But happy is he who keeps the law. ,20250217
19 A slave will not be instructed by words {alone;} For though he understands_ there will be no response. ,20250217
20 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him. ,20250217
21 He who pampers his slave from childhood Will in the end find him to be a son. ,20250217
22 An angry man stirs up strife_ And a hot-tempered man abounds in transgression. ,20250217
23 A man's pride will bring him low_ But a humble spirit will obtain honor. ,20250217
24 He who is a partner with a thief hates his own life; He hears the oath but tells nothing. ,20250217
25 The fear of man brings a snare_ But he who trusts in the LORD will be exalted. ,20250217
26 Many seek the ruler's favor_ But justice for man {comes} from the LORD. ,20250217
27 An unjust man is abominable to the righteous_ And he who is upright in the way is abominable to the wicked. ,20250217
1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh_ the oracle. The man declares to Ithiel_ to Ithiel and Ucal: ,20250217
2 Surely Iam more stupid than any man_ And I do not have the understanding of a man. ,20250217
3 Neither have I learned wisdom_ Nor do I have the knowledge of the Holy One. ,20250217
4 Who has ascended into heaven and descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has wrapped the waters in His garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name or His son's name? Surely you know! ,20250217
5 Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. ,20250217
6 Do not add to His words Lest He reprove you_ and you be proved a liar. ,20250217
7 Two things I asked of Thee_ Do not refuse me before I die: ,20250217
8 Keep deception and lies far from me_ Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food that is my portion_ ,20250217
9 Lest I be full and deny Thee and say_ __Who is the Lord?__ Or lest I be in want and steal_ And profane the name of my God. ,20250217
10 Do not slander a slave to his master_ Lest he curse you and you be found guilty. ,20250217
11 There is a kind of man who curses his father_ And does not bless his mother. ,20250217
12 There is a kind who is pure in his own eyes_ Yet is not washed from his filthiness. ,20250217
13 There is a kind oh how lofty are his eyes! And his eyelids are raised in arrogance. ,20250217
14 There is a kind of man whose teeth are like swords_ And his jaw teeth like knives_ To devour the afflicted from the earth_ And the needy from among men. ,20250217
15 The leech has two daughters_ __Give___ __Give.__ There are three things that will not be satisfied_ Four that will not say_ __Enough__: ,20250217
16 Sheol_ and the barren womb_ Earth that is never satisfied with water_ And fire that never says_ __Enough.__ ,20250217
17 The eye that mocks a father_ And scorns a mother_ The ravens of the valley will pick it out_ And the young eagles will eat it. ,20250217
18 There are three things which are too wonderful for me_ Four which I do not understand: ,20250217
19 The way of an eagle in the sky_ The way of a serpent on a rock_ The way of a ship in the middle of the sea_ And the way of a man with a maid. ,20250217
20 This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth_ And says_ __I have done no wrong.__ ,20250217
21 Under three things the earth quakes_ And under four_ it cannot bear up: Under a slave when he becomes king_ And a fool when he is satisfied with food_ ,20250217
23 Under an unloved woman when she gets a husband_ And a maidservant when she supplants her mistress. ,20250217
24 Four things are small on the earth_ But they are exceedingly wise: ,20250217
25 The ants are not a strong folk_ But they prepare their food in the summer; ,20250217
26 The badgers are not mighty folk_ Yet they make their houses in the rocks; ,20250217
27 The locusts have no king_ Yet all of them go out in ranks; ,20250217
28 The lizard you may grasp with the hands_ Yet it is in kings' palaces. ,20250217
29 There are three things which are stately in their march_ Even four which are stately when they walk: ,20250217
30 The lion which is mighty among beasts And does not retreat before any_ ,20250217
31 The strutting cock_ the male goat also_ And a king when his army is with him. ,20250217
32 If you have been foolish in exalting yourself Or if you have plotted evil_ put your hand on your mouth. ,20250217
33 For the churning of milk produces butter_ And pressing the nose brings forth blood; So the churning of anger produces strife. ,20250217
1 The words of King Lemuel_ the oracle which his mother taught him: ,20250217
2 What_ O my son? And what_ O son of my womb? And what_ O son of my vows? ,20250217
3 Do not give your strength to women_ Or your ways to that which destroys kings. ,20250217
4 It is not for kings_ O Lemuel_ It is not for kings to drink wine_ Or for rulers to desire strong drink_ ,20250217
5 For they will drink and forget what is decreed_ And pervert the rights of all the afflicted. ,20250217
6 Give strong drink to him who is perishing_ And wine to him whose life is bitter. ,20250217
7 Let him drink and forget his poverty And remember his trouble no more. ,20250217
8 Open your mouth for the mute_ For the rights of all the unfortunate. ,20250217
9 Open your mouth_ judge righteously_ And defend the rights of the afflicted and needy. ,20250217
10 An excellent wife_ who can find? For her worth is far above jewels. ,20250217
11 The heart of her husband trusts in her_ And he will have no lack of gain. ,20250217
12 She does him good and not evil All the days of her life. ,20250217
13 She looks for wool and flax And works with her hands in delight. ,20250217
14 She is like merchant ships; She brings her food from afar. ,20250217
15 She rises also while it is still night And gives food to her household And portions to her maidens. ,20250217
16 She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she plants a vineyard. ,20250217
17 She girds herself with strength And makes her arms strong. ,20250217
18 She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out at night. ,20250217
19 She stretches out her hands to the distaff_ And her hands grasp the spindle. ,20250217
20 She extends her hand to the poor_ And she stretches out her hands to the needy. ,20250217
21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household_ For all her household are clothed with scarlet. ,20250217
22 She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine linen and purple. ,20250217
23 Her husband is known in the gates_ When he sits among the elders of the land. ,20250217
24 She makes linen garments and sells {them_} And supplies belts to the tradesmen. ,20250217
25 Strength and dignity are her clothing_ And she smiles at the future. ,20250217
26 She opens her mouth in wisdom_ And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. ,20250217
27 She looks well to the ways of her household_ And does not eat the bread of idleness. ,20250217
28 Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband {also_} and he praises her_ {saying:} ,20250217
29 __Many daughters have done nobly_ But you excel them all.__ ,20250217
30 Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain_ {But} a woman who fears the LORD_ she shall be praised. ,20250217
31 Give her the product of her hands_ And let her works praise her in the gates. ,20250217
1 The words of the Preacher_ the son of David_ king in Jerusalem. ,20250217
2__ Vanity of vanities___ says the Preacher_ __Vanity of vanities! All is vanity.__ ,20250217
3 What advantage does man have in all his work Which he does under the sun? ,20250217
4 A generation goes and a generation comes_ But the earth remains forever. ,20250217
5 Also_ the sun rises and the sun sets; And hastening to its place it rises there {again.} ,20250217
6 Blowing toward the south_ Then turning toward the north_ The wind continues swirling along; And on its circular courses the wind returns. ,20250217
7 All the rivers flow into the sea_ Yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow_ There they flow again. ,20250217
8 All things are wearisome; Man is not able to tell {it.} The eye is not satisfied with seeing_ Nor is the ear filled with hearing. ,20250217
9 That which has been is that which will be_ And that which has been done is that which will be done. So there is nothing new under the sun. ,20250217
10 Is there anything of which one might say_ __See this_ it is new__? Already it has existed for ages Which were before us. ,20250217
11 There is no remembrance of earlier things; And also of the later things which will occur_ There will be for them no remembrance Among those who will come later {still.} ,20250217
12 I_ the Preacher_ have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. ,20250217
13 And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven. {It} is a grievous task {which} God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with. ,20250217
14 I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun_ and behold_ all is vanity and striving after wind. ,20250217
15 What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is lacking cannot be counted. ,20250217
16 I said to myself_ __Behold_ I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.__ ,20250217
17 And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind. ,20250217
18 Because in much wisdom there is much grief_ and increasing knowledge {results in} increasing pain. 1 I said to myself_ __Come now_ I will test you with pleasure. So enjoy yourself.__ And behold_ it too was futility. ,20250217
2 I said of laughter_ __It is madness___ and of pleasure_ __What does it accomplish?__ ,20250217
3 I explored with my mind {how} to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding {me} wisely_ and how to take hold of folly_ until I could see what good there is for the sons of men to do under heaven the few years of their lives. ,20250217
4 I enlarged my works: I built houses for myself_ I planted vineyards for myself; ,20250217
5 I made gardens and parks for myself and I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees; ,20250217
6 I made ponds of water for myself from which to irrigate a forest of growing trees. ,20250217
7 I bought male and female slaves and I had homeborn slaves. Also I possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. ,20250217
8 Also_ I collected for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself male and female singers and the pleasures of men--many concubines. ,20250217
9 Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also stood by me. ,20250217
10 All that my eyes desired I did not refuse them. I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure_ for my heart was pleased because of all my labor and this was my reward for all my labor. ,20250217
11 Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done and the labor which I had exerted_ and behold all was vanity and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun. ,20250217
12 So I turned to consider wisdom_ madness and folly; for what {will} the man {do} who will come after the king {except} what has already been done? ,20250217
13 And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness. ,20250217
14 The wise man's eyes are in his head_ but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I know that one fate befalls them both. ,20250217
15 Then I said to myself_ __ As is the fate of the fool_ it will also befall me. Why then have I been extremely wise?__ So I said to myself_ __This too is vanity.__ ,20250217
16 For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise man {as} with the fool_ inasmuch as {in} the coming days all will be forgotten. And how the wise man and the fool alike die! ,20250217
17 So I hated life_ for the work which had been done under the sun was grievous to me; because everything is futility and striving after wind. ,20250217
18 Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun_ for I must leave it to the man who will come after me. ,20250217
19 And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the sun. This too is vanity. ,20250217
20 Therefore I completely despaired of all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun. ,20250217
21 When there is a man who has labored with wisdom_ knowledge and skill_ then he gives his legacy to one who has not labored with them. This too is vanity and a great evil. ,20250217
22 For what does a man get in all his labor and in his striving with which he labors under the sun? ,20250217
23 Because all his days his task is painful and grievous; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is vanity. ,20250217
24 There is nothing better for a man {than} to eat and drink and tell himself that his labor is good. This also I have seen that it is from the hand of God. ,20250217
25 For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him? ,20250217
26 For to a person who is good in His sight He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy_ while to the sinner He has given the task of gathering and collecting so that he may give to one who is good in God's sight. This too is vanity and striving after wind. ,20250217
1 There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every event under heaven— ,20250217
2 A time to give birth and a time to die; A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted. ,20250217
3 A time to kill and a time to heal; A time to tear down and a time to build up. ,20250217
4 A time to weep and a time to laugh; A time to mourn and a time to dance. ,20250217
5 A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones; A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing. ,20250217
6 A time to search and a time to give up as lost; A time to keep and a time to throw away. ,20250217
7 A time to tear apart and a time to sew together; A time to be silent and a time to speak. ,20250217
8 A time to love and a time to hate; A time for war and a time for peace. ,20250217
9 What profit is there to the worker from that in which he toils? ,20250217
10 I have seen the task which God has given the sons of men with which to occupy themselves. ,20250217
11 He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart_ yet so that man will not find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end. ,20250217
12 I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good in one's lifetime; ,20250217
13 moreover_ that every man who eats and drinks sees good in all his labor--it is the gift of God. ,20250217
14 I know that everything God does will remain forever; there is nothing to add to it and there is nothing to take from it_ for God has {so} worked that men should fear Him. ,20250217
15 That which is has been already and that which will be has already been_ for God seeks what has passed by. ,20250217
16 Furthermore_ I have seen under the sun {that} in the place of justice there is wickedness and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness. ,20250217
17 I said to myself_ __ God will judge both the righteous man and the wicked man___ for a time for every matter and for every deed is there. ,20250217
18 I said to myself concerning the sons of men_ __God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts.__ ,20250217
19 For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed_ they all have the same breath and there is no advantage for man over beast_ for all is vanity. ,20250217
20 All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust. ,20250217
21 Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth? ,20250217
22 I have seen that nothing is better than that man should be happy in his activities_ for that is his lot. For who will bring him to see what will occur after him? ,20250217
1 Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were being done under the sun. And behold {I saw} the tears of the oppressed and {that} they had no one to comfort {them;} and on the side of their oppressors was power_ but they had no one to comfort {them.} ,20250217
2 So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living. ,20250217
3 But better {off} than both of them is the one who has never existed_ who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun. ,20250217
4 I have seen that every labor and every skill which is done is {the result of} rivalry between a man and his neighbor. This too is vanity and striving after wind. ,20250217
5 The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh. ,20250217
6 One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of labor and striving after wind. ,20250217
7 Then I looked again at vanity under the sun. ,20250217
8 There was a certain man without a dependent_ having neither a son nor a brother_ yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed_ his eyes were not satisfied with riches {and he never asked_} __And for whom am I laboring and depriving myself of pleasure?__ This too is vanity and it is a grievous task. ,20250217
9 Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor. ,20250217
10 For if either of them falls_ the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up. ,20250217
11 Furthermore_ if two lie down together they keep warm_ but how can one be warm {alone?} ,20250217
12 And if one can overpower him who is alone_ two can resist him. A cord of three {strands} is not quickly torn apart. ,20250217
13 A poor yet wise lad is better than an old and foolish king who no longer knows {how} to receive instruction. ,20250217
14 For he has come out of prison to become king_ even though he was born poor in his kingdom. ,20250217
15 I have seen all the living under the sun throng to the side of the second lad who replaces him. ,20250217
16 There is no end to all the people_ to all who were before them_ and even the ones who will come later will not be happy with him_ for this too is vanity and striving after wind. ,20250217
1 Guard your steps as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools; for they do not know they are doing evil. ,20250217
2 Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few. ,20250217
3 For the dream comes through much effort and the voice of a fool through many words. ,20250217
4 When you make a vow to God_ do not be late in paying it; for {He takes} no delight in fools. Pay what you vow! ,20250217
5 It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. ,20250217
6 Do not let your speech cause you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger {of God} that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry on account of your voice and destroy the work of your hands? ,20250217
7 For in many dreams and in many words there is emptiness. Rather_ fear God. ,20250217
8 If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province_ do not be shocked at the sight; for one official watches over another official_ and there are higher officials over them. ,20250217
9 After all_ a king who cultivates the field is an advantage to the land. ,20250217
10 He who loves money will not be satisfied with money_ nor he who loves abundance {with its} income. This too is vanity. ,20250217
11 When good things increase_ those who consume them increase. So what is the advantage to their owners except to look on? ,20250217
12 The sleep of the working man is pleasant_ whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to sleep. ,20250217
13 There is a grievous evil {which} I have seen under the sun: riches being hoarded by their owner to his hurt. ,20250217
14 When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he had fathered a son_ then there was nothing to support him. ,20250217
15 As he had come naked from his mother's womb_ so will he return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand. ,20250217
16 This also is a grievous evil--exactly as a man is born_ thus will he die. So what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind? ,20250217
17 Throughout his life {he} also eats in darkness with great vexation_ sickness and anger. ,20250217
18 Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat_ to drink and enjoy oneself in all one's labor in which he toils under the sun {during} the few years of his life which God has given him; for this is his reward. ,20250217
19 Furthermore_ as for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth_ He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward and rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God. ,20250217
20 For he will not often consider the years of his life_ because God keeps him occupied with the gladness of his heart. ,20250217
1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men— ,20250217
2 aman to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires; yet God has not empowered him to eat from them_ for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe affliction. ,20250217
3 If a man fathers a hundred {children} and lives many years_ however many they be_ but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he does not even have a {proper} burial_ {then} I say_ __Better the miscarriage than he_ ,20250217
4 for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity. ,20250217
5 __It never sees the sun and it never knows {anything;} it is better off than he. ,20250217
6 __Even if the {other} man lives a thousand years twice and does not enjoy good things-- do not all go to one place?__ ,20250217
7 All a man's labor is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied. ,20250217
8 For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool? What {advantage} does the poor man have_ knowing {how} to walk before the living? ,20250217
9 What the eyes see is better than what the soul desires. This too is futility and a striving after wind. ,20250217
10 Whatever exists has already been named_ and it is known what man is; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than he is. ,20250217
11 For there are many words which increase futility. What {then} is the advantage to a man? ,20250217
12 For who knows what is good for a man during {his} lifetime_ {during} the few years of his futile life? He will spend them like a shadow. For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun? ,20250217
1 A good name is better than a good ointment_ And the day of {one's} death is better than the day of one's birth. ,20250217
2 It is better to go to a house of mourning Than to go to a house of feasting_ Because that is the end of every man_ And the living takes {it} to heart. ,20250217
3 Sorrow is better than laughter_ For when a face is sad a heart may be happy. ,20250217
4 The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning_ While the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure. ,20250217
5 It is better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man Than for one to listen to the song of fools. ,20250217
6 For as the crackling of thorn bushes under a pot_ So is the laughter of the fool; And this too is futility. ,20250217
7 For oppression makes a wise man mad_ And a bribe corrupts the heart. ,20250217
8 The end of a matter is better than its beginning; Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit. ,20250217
9 Do not be eager in your heart to be angry_ For anger resides in the bosom of fools. ,20250217
10 Do not say_ __Why is it that the former days were better than these?__ For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this. ,20250217
11 Wisdom along with an inheritance is good And an advantage to those who see the sun. ,20250217
12 For wisdom is protection {just as} money is protection_ But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the lives of its possessors. ,20250217
13 Consider the work of God_ For who is able to straighten what He has bent? ,20250217
14 In the day of prosperity be happy_ But in the day of adversity consider-- God has made the one as well as the other So that man will not discover anything {that will be} after him. ,20250217
15 I have seen everything during my lifetime of futility; there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness and there is a wicked man who prolongs {his life} in his wickedness. ,20250217
16 Do not be excessively righteous and do not be overly wise. Why should you ruin yourself? ,20250217
17 Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time? ,20250217
18 It is good that you grasp one thing and also not let go of the other; for the one who fears God comes forth with both of them. ,20250217
19 Wisdom strengthens a wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city. ,20250217
20 Indeed_ there is not a righteous man on earth who {continually} does good and who never sins. ,20250217
21 Also_ do not take seriously all words which are spoken_ so that you will not hear your servant cursing you. ,20250217
22 For you also have realized that you likewise have many times cursed others. ,20250217
23 I tested all this with wisdom_ {and} I said_ __I will be wise___ but it was far from me. ,20250217
24 What has been is remote and exceedingly mysterious. Who can discover it? ,20250217
25 I directed my mind to know_ to investigate and to seek wisdom and an explanation_ and to know the evil of folly and the foolishness of madness. ,20250217
26 And I discovered more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets_ whose hands are chains. One who is pleasing to God will escape from her_ but the sinner will be captured by her. ,20250217
27 __Behold_ I have discovered this___ says the Preacher_ __{adding} one thing to another to find an explanation_ ,20250217
28 which I am still seeking but have not found. I have found one man among a thousand_ but I have not found a woman among all these. ,20250217
29 __Behold_ I have found only this_ that God made men upright_ but they have sought out many devices.__ ,20250217
1 Who is like the wise man and who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man's wisdom illumines him and causes his stern face to beam. ,20250217
2 I say_ __Keep the command of the king because of the oath before God. ,20250217
3 __Do not be in a hurry to leave him. Do not join in an evil matter_ for he will do whatever he pleases.__ ,20250217
4 Since the word of the king is authoritative_ who will say to him_ __What are you doing?__ ,20250217
5 He who keeps a {royal} command experiences no trouble_ for a wise heart knows the proper time and procedure. ,20250217
6 For there is a proper time and procedure for every delight_ though a man's trouble is heavy upon him. ,20250217
7 If no one knows what will happen_ who can tell him when it will happen? ,20250217
8 No man has authority to restrain the wind with the wind_ or authority over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the time of war_ and evil will not deliver those who practice it. ,20250217
9 All this I have seen and applied my mind to every deed that has been done under the sun wherein a man has exercised authority over {another} man to his hurt. ,20250217
10 So then_ I have seen the wicked buried_ those who used to go in and out from the holy place_ and they are {soon} forgotten in the city where they did thus. This too is futility. ,20250217
11 Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly_ therefore the hearts of the sons of men among them are given fully to do evil. ,20250217
12 Although a sinner does evil a hundred {times} and may lengthen his {life_} still I know that it will be well for those who fear God_ who fear Him openly. ,20250217
13 But it will not be well for the evil man and he will not lengthen his days like a shadow_ because he does not fear God. ,20250217
14 There is futility which is done on the earth_ that is_ there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked. On the other hand_ there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is futility. ,20250217
15 So I commended pleasure_ for there is nothing good for a man under the sun except to eat and to drink and to be merry_ and this will stand by him in his toils {throughout} the days of his life which God has given him under the sun. ,20250217
16 When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the task which has been done on the earth (even though one should never sleep day or night)_ ,20250217
17 and I saw every work of God_ {I concluded} that man cannot discover the work which has been done under the sun. Even though man should seek laboriously_ he will not discover; and though the wise man should say_ __I know___ he cannot discover. ,20250217
1 For I have taken all this to my heart and explain it that righteous men_ wise men_ and their deeds are in the hand of God. Man does not know whether {it will be} love or hatred; anything awaits him. ,20250217
2 It is the same for all. There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good_ for the clean and for the unclean; for the man who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice. As the good man is_ so is the sinner; as the swearer is_ so is the one who is afraid to swear. ,20250217
3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun_ that there is one fate for all men. Furthermore_ the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil and insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives. Afterwards they {go} to the dead. ,20250217
4 For whoever is joined with all the living_ there is hope; surely a live dog is better than a dead lion. ,20250217
5 For the living know they will die; but the dead do not know anything_ nor have they any longer a reward_ for their memory is forgotten. ,20250217
6 Indeed their love_ their hate and their zeal have already perished_ and they will no longer have a share in all that is done under the sun. ,20250217
7 Go {then_} eat your bread in happiness and drink your wine with a cheerful heart; for God has already approved your works. ,20250217
8 Let your clothes be white all the time_ and let not oil be lacking on your head. ,20250217
9 Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun. ,20250217
10 Whatever your hand finds to do_ do {it} with {all} your might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol where you are going. ,20250217
11 I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the warriors_ and neither is bread to the wise nor wealth to the discerning nor favor to men of ability; for time and chance overtake them all. ,20250217
12 Moreover_ man does not know his time: like fish caught in a treacherous net and birds trapped in a snare_ so the sons of men are ensnared at an evil time when it suddenly falls on them. ,20250217
13 Also this I came to see as wisdom under the sun_ and it impressed me. ,20250217
14 There was a small city with few men in it and a great king came to it_ surrounded it and constructed large siegeworks against it. ,20250217
15 But there was found in it a poor wise man and he delivered the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man. ,20250217
16 So I said_ __ Wisdom is better than strength.__ But the wisdom of the poor man is despised and his words are not heeded. ,20250217
17 The words of the wise heard in quietness are {better} than the shouting of a ruler among fools. ,20250217
18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war_ but one sinner destroys much good. ,20250217
1 Dead flies make a perfumer's oil stink_ so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom {and} honor. ,20250217
2 A wise man's heart {directs him} toward the right_ but the foolish man's heart {directs him} toward the left. ,20250217
3 Even when the fool walks along the road_ his sense is lacking and he demonstrates to everyone {that} he is a fool. ,20250217
4 If the ruler's temper rises against you_ do not abandon your position_ because composure allays great offenses. ,20250217
5 There is an evil I have seen under the sun_ like an error which goes forth from the ruler— ,20250217
6 folly is set in many exalted places while rich men sit in humble places. ,20250217
7 I have seen slaves {riding} on horses and princes walking like slaves on the land. ,20250217
8 He who digs a pit may fall into it_ and a serpent may bite him who breaks through a wall. ,20250217
9 He who quarries stones may be hurt by them_ and he who splits logs may be endangered by them. ,20250217
10 If the axe is dull and he does not sharpen {its} edge_ then he must exert more strength. Wisdom has the advantage of giving success. ,20250217
11 If the serpent bites before being charmed_ there is no profit for the charmer. ,20250217
12 Words from the mouth of a wise man are gracious_ while the lips of a fool consume him; ,20250217
13 the beginning of his talking is folly and the end of it is wicked madness. ,20250217
14 Yet the fool multiplies words. No man knows what will happen_ and who can tell him what will come after him? ,20250217
15 The toil of a fool {so} wearies him that he does not {even} know how to go to a city. ,20250217
16 Woe to you_ O land_ whose king is a lad and whose princes feast in the morning. ,20250217
17 Blessed are you_ O land_ whose king is of nobility and whose princes eat at the appropriate time--for strength and not for drunkenness. ,20250217
18 Through indolence the rafters sag_ and through slackness the house leaks. ,20250217
19 {Men} prepare a meal for enjoyment_ and wine makes life merry_ and money is the answer to everything. ,20250217
20 Furthermore_ in your bedchamber do not curse a king_ and in your sleeping rooms do not curse a rich man_ for a bird of the heavens will carry the sound and the winged creature will make the matter known. ,20250217
1 Cast your bread on the surface of the waters_ for you will find it after many days. ,20250217
2 Divide your portion to seven_ or even to eight_ for you do not know what misfortune may occur on the earth. ,20250217
3 If the clouds are full_ they pour out rain upon the earth; and whether a tree falls toward the south or toward the north_ wherever the tree falls_ there it lies. ,20250217
4 He who watches the wind will not sow and he who looks at the clouds will not reap. ,20250217
5 Just as you do not know the path of the wind and how bones {are formed} in the womb of the pregnant woman_ so you do not know the activity of God who makes all things. ,20250217
6 Sow your seed in the morning and do not be idle in the evening_ for you do not know whether morning or evening sowing will succeed_ or whether both of them alike will be good. ,20250217
7 The light is pleasant_ and {it is} good for the eyes to see the sun. ,20250217
8 Indeed_ if a man should live many years_ let him rejoice in them all_ and let him remember the days of darkness_ for they will be many. Everything that is to come {will be} futility. ,20250217
9 Rejoice_ young man_ during your childhood_ and let your heart be pleasant during the days of young manhood. And follow the impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes. Yet know that God will bring you to judgment for all these things. ,20250217
10 So_ remove grief and anger from your heart and put away pain from your body_ because childhood and the prime of life are fleeting. ,20250217
1 Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth_ before the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say_ __I have no delight in them__; ,20250217
2 before the sun and the light_ the moon and the stars are darkened_ and clouds return after the rain; ,20250217
3 in the day that the watchmen of the house tremble_ and mighty men stoop_ the grinding ones stand idle because they are few_ and those who look through windows grow dim; ,20250217
4 and the doors on the street are shut as the sound of the grinding mill is low_ and one will arise at the sound of the bird_ and all the daughters of song will sing softly. ,20250217
5 Furthermore_ men are afraid of a high place and of terrors on the road; the almond tree blossoms_ the grasshopper drags himself along_ and the caperberry is ineffective. For man goes to his eternal home while mourners go about in the street. ,20250217
6 {Remember Him} before the silver cord is broken and the golden bowl is crushed_ the pitcher by the well is shattered and the wheel at the cistern is crushed; ,20250217
7 then the dust will return to the earth as it was_ and the spirit will return to God who gave it. ,20250217
8__ Vanity of vanities___ says the Preacher_ __all is vanity!__ ,20250217
9 In addition to being a wise man_ the Preacher also taught the people knowledge; and he pondered_ searched out and arranged many proverbs. ,20250217
10 The Preacher sought to find delightful words and to write words of truth correctly. ,20250217
11 The words of wise men are like goads_ and masters of {these} collections are like well-driven nails; they are given by one Shepherd. ,20250217
12 But beyond this_ my son_ be warned: the writing of many books is endless_ and excessive devotion {to books} is wearying to the body. ,20250217
13 The conclusion_ when all has been heard_ {is:} fear God and keep His commandments_ because this {applies to} every person. ,20250217
14 For God will bring every act to judgment_ everything which is hidden_ whether it is good or evil. ,20250217
1 The Song of Songs_ which is Solomon's. ,20250217
2 __May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine. ,20250217
3 __Your oils have a pleasing fragrance_ Your name is {like} purified oil; Therefore the maidens love you. ,20250217
4 __Draw me after you {and} let us run {together!} The king has brought me into his chambers.__ __We will rejoice in you and be glad; We will extol your love more than wine. Rightly do they love you.__ ,20250217
5 __I am black but lovely_ O daughters of Jerusalem_ Like the tents of Kedar_ Like the curtains of Solomon. ,20250217
6 __Do not stare at me because I am swarthy_ For the sun has burned me. My mother's sons were angry with me; They made me caretaker of the vineyards_ {But} I have not taken care of my own vineyard. ,20250217
7 __Tell me_ O you whom my soul loves_ Where do you pasture {your flock_} Where do you make {it} lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who veils herself Beside the flocks of your companions?__ ,20250217
8 __If you yourself do not know_ Most beautiful among women_ Go forth on the trail of the flock And pasture your young goats By the tents of the shepherds. ,20250217
9 __To me_ my darling_ you are like My mare among the chariots of Pharaoh. ,20250217
10 __Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments_ Your neck with strings of beads.__ ,20250217
11 __We will make for you ornaments of gold With beads of silver.__ ,20250217
12 __While the king was at his table_ My perfume gave forth its fragrance. ,20250217
13 __My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrh Which lies all night between my breasts. ,20250217
14 __My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms In the vineyards of Engedi.__ ,20250217
15 __ How beautiful you are_ my darling_ How beautiful you are! Your eyes are {like} doves.__ ,20250217
16 __How handsome you are_ my beloved_ {And} so pleasant! Indeed_ our couch is luxuriant! ,20250217
17 __The beams of our houses are cedars_ Our rafters_ cypresses. ,20250217
1 __I am the rose of Sharon_ The lily of the valleys.__ ,20250217
2 __Like a lily among the thorns_ So is my darling among the maidens.__ ,20250217
3 __Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest_ So is my beloved among the young men. In his shade I took great delight and sat down_ And his fruit was sweet to my taste. ,20250217

2 Listen_ O heavens_ and hear_ O earth; For the LORD speaks_ __ Sons I have reared and brought up_ But they have revolted against Me. ,20250217
3 __An ox knows its owner_ And a donkey its master's manger_ {But} Israel does not know_ My people do not understand.__ ,20250217

9 Unless the LORD of hosts Had left us a few survivors_ We would be like Sodom_ We would be like Gomorrah. ,20250217

11 __ What are your multiplied sacrifices to Me?__ Says the LORD. __I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams And the fat of fed cattle; And I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls_ lambs or goats. ,20250217
12 __When you come to appear before Me_ Who requires of you this trampling of My courts? ,20250217
13 __Bring your worthless offerings no longer_ Incense is an abomination to Me. New moon and sabbath_ the calling of assemblies-- I cannot endure iniquity and the solemn assembly. ,20250217
14 __I hate your new moon {festivals} and your appointed feasts_ They have become a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing {them.} ,20250217
15 __So when you spread out your hands {in prayer_} I will hide My eyes from you; Yes_ even though you multiply prayers_ I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood. ,20250217
16 __ Wash yourselves_ make yourselves clean; Remove the evil of your deeds from My sight. Cease to do evil_ ,20250217

21 How the faithful city has become a harlot_ She {who} was full of justice! Righteousness once lodged in her_ But now murderers. ,20250217
22 Your silver has become dross_ Your drink diluted with water. ,20250217
23 Your rulers are rebels And companions of thieves; Everyone loves a bribe And chases after rewards. They do not defend the orphan_ Nor does the widow's plea come before them. ,20250217
24 Therefore the Lord GOD of hosts_ The Mighty One of Israel_ declares_ __Ah_ I will be relieved of My adversaries And avenge Myself on My foes. ,20250217
25 __I will also turn My hand against you_ And will smelt away your dross as with lye And will remove all your alloy. ,20250217
